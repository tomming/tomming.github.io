That's not what sets Gould apart. But i agree with everything else.  

To me it's his intuition for finding the hidden gems within each composition and bringing them to light.  Knowing when to bring a countermelody into the foreground, even at the expense of a fugal subject... it's impressive intellectually (keeping multiple threads going and multiple layers defined), technically (his prowess and dexterity) and artistically (finding meaning from the shortest phrase to the longest structural arcs).

He's good.

If you can *feel* that the root of whatever's going on is C and you can *feel* that it's major-sounding and you can *feel* that there aren't complicating things like other important notes in the harmony, then it's C major.  You don't need the vertical structure to be there.

How does that "feeling" come about?  One way is that the notes of the chord are there and are somehow made important.  If you have C D E F G, G, A A A A G, F F F F E, E, D D D D C, then you don't really need any other notes to know that the first measure is C major, the second is F major then C major, the next is *either* F major or G7 followed by C major, and the last is G major followed by C major.  Just a couple of other notes -- say, a countermelody that hits some of the auxiliary notes -- will make you certain that the last chord isn't suddenly an Abaug6, say, or it might clarify that the third measure is actually Dm, G9, C, Am7, and the last is Dm7/F, G9, C6.  (I think I embellished that a bit, at the end.)  By the way, the melody is Over the Hills and Far Away, which I know from Percy Grainger's Children's March.

What happens is that the mind remembers notes that came previously, especially if they were important.  For example, say you have eighth notes going G F E D C.  That's very much a C major harmony if you have no other clues.  Now, say a low A was being held before this.  Now you're thinking in the context of A minor instead of C major.  If a C major chord was playing before, you're going to hear three C major chords: *G* F *E* D *C*.  If a G7 chord was playing before, you're going to hear two G7 chords resolving to C major: *G* *F* E *D* *C*.  In the first case, the F and D were just passing tones; now, the E is a passing tone.  Same notes!

A good composer can use just hints to tell you what the harmony is, without having to stick a chord in front of you with neon signs and arrows.  A really good composer might leave the harmony ambiguous, leaving you not quite resolved until the composer wants the finality and certainty.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-02-05 15:16:40 xiipaoc<br>I've been in two wind ensembles that performed Baroque pieces like this.

Basically, in a normal performance, you have the ensemble in front of you on the stage.  In an antiphonal situation, you have usually two ensembles on opposite sides of the stage or even of the hall, giving you a stereophonic effect.  Usually the composer intends for the piece to be performed like this, so the two ensembles will be clearly in group 1 or group 2, and the two groups will interact with each other.  There's a lot of early work for brass written in this style.

Sometimes you'll have just one group of antiphonal instruments, like antiphonal trumpets.  The ensemble is on the stage doing its thing, and all of a sudden the trumpet section is on the balcony behind you playing a countermelody.  Sometimes you'll have an "off-stage" ensemble, usually to produce the effect of the sound being distant or otherworldly.  I'm not sure if this counts as antiphonal, since usually they're not specifically in counterpoint to the main ensemble, just softer and hidden.

My last wind ensemble's director was a huge fan of doing fugues in antiphonal settings.  He'd have the basses on the right of the stage (house right) and the sopranos on the left, and the altos would be on the aisle by the stairs on the right and the tenors on the left.  It was REALLY hard to stay together separated like that; I'd imagine it was a total mess for the listener anywhere but the middle.  Probably why antiphonal performances have kind of fallen out of style these last 300 years!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-02-28 08:31:45 xiipaoc<br>Nice!

One of my favorite reharmonization techniques is the mode change, where you switch to the relative minor, or some crazier mode changes.  If you don't mind changing the melody notes, putting a minor melody into phrygian can be pretty awesome.

But my other favorite reharmonization technique, which is probably due to a little too much Grainger, is chromatic motion.  Not of the root, necessarily, but of some note in the chord.  If you imagine a countermelody that's descending chromatically in some rhythm, the puzzle is to figure out chords that fit both those and the melody notes, and the melody notes are a bit less important, I think -- you can harmonize the entire melody with an Am7, for instance, but you really wouldn't want to!

Anyway, my only critique of your wonderful work is that you really don't need to add notes to chords to make them different.  Adding notes to chords is great only for two reasons: either the note you add is important, or you want to change the color of the chord.  For example, on the downbeat of the first measure, Am7 isn't more interesting than Am, since the G isn't important, but perhaps you want the jazzy feel.  Still, not much of a reharmonization over Am.  Ab7, on the other hand, would be a *very* different chord!

Good luck reharmonizing other things!  I know I can get carried away reharmonizing when I write songs for my a cappella group, and they get mad at me for making things too complicated. ;p
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-03-12 01:58:48 keakealani<br>Well, I can't say I know a lot about pop music but I can try to illuminate the process from a classical perspective...

One way to extend chord progressions is to cycle to different chords of the same function. For example, instead of I IV V I, you could do I IV ii V/V V I. You're basically extending the predominant function. This can be really effective if all the movement you do is chromatic, so you get this nice chromatic countermelody without really disrupting the harmonic structure of the piece.

Another strategy is to employ "passing" chords - the simplest explanation is something like I V6/4 I6. Essentially the bass line moves and the in-between chord is basically just decoration. You can often through chords in between any standard progression and still have a similar harmonic feel, but it does extend the progression significantly. Just experiment with chords you like.

I think part of longer progressions, especially in pop, is that you have to become a lot more adventurous. It only sounds interesting because it's a deviation from the norm. So be creative and look for chords that aren't necessarily standard for a progression. You might come up with something really cool :)

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-09-14 03:07:43 xiipaoc<br>That's nice!  Very pretty.  It's a good first section.

A minuet is usually in AABBCCDDAABB form, though it can vary.  The CCDD is a contrasting section called the trio (I think at one point it was played by a reduced orchestration or something).  The trio is usually in a different key -- usually the IV but that's not necessary -- and has a different mood.  In a good minuet, the B section is an answer to the A section, and the D section is an answer to the C section, but the main part and the trio aren't so closely related; if they are, it no longer sounds like it's the trio section.  A minuet is also always in a fairly moderate 3/4; if it's too fast it's more like a scherzo, which is otherwise the same as a minuet.

Of course, you should feel free to break the form.  You can vary quite a bit while still leaving enough elements in there that it's still recognizable as a minuet.  You can change the repeats, for instance: AABBA at the start, or AAB, or AABA, or just AB.  You can skip the repeats the last time through, which is very common.  You can follow common march practice and make the repetitions different from the originals in some meaningful way -- softer, staccato except for the countermelody, something like that.  You can play around with the form.  Remember that even non-minuets can be good music -- if you break the mold too much, it doesn't mean you've failed!

Other than that, harmony/chord progression, and occasionally counterpoint &amp; countermelody, I don't really use theory for my work at all.

As is so often the case, I think some of the beauty in the composition goes beyond the notes and chords. Specifically, one of the things I particularly like that is not immediately apparent is that for a large part of the piece the melody is the high guitar part, and the vocals are more of a countermelody. That texture is present in the vamp section you linked to as well, making it less "melody and accompaniment" and more a duet between voice and guitar.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-02-09 18:49:38 mikeoquinn<br>I'm not an expert, but I've given this a lot of thought over the past few years as I've sought to understand Irish music in order to arrange traditional pieces in what I hope are fun and invigorating ways, without sacrificing the tradition that gave them birth.

This will not be over quickly. Brain-dump incoming.

* **Step 1: Cut a hole in the box.**

Maybe I'm thinking of something else...

* **Step 2: Listen to a ton of Celtic music**

No, seriously, do it.

A couple of years back, at the [O'Flaherty Irish Music Retreat](http://www.oflahertyretreat.org), one of the instructors was leading a session on teaching Irish music, no matter your skill level. It was really cool for a number of reasons, but one thing he mentioned was this concept of listening casually vs. listening critically.

Listening casually is what most folks do in the car, at the gym, in elevators, etc. It's listening to the music for the sake of the music. With regards to Irish music, the biggest difference between a musician born in Ireland and one not is the fact that it's more likely that the native will grow up listening casually to the music, at pubs, on the radio, at home, etc. Casual listening is what builds familiarity with the style, builds a brain-database of sounds and combinations and expectations. It's what gives you the burst of inspiration at a session that leads to something awesome - you hear something you can do in your head, and you just do it, knowing where you're going because you've already heard other people do _that thing_ or something like it.

Listening critically is another beast altogether. This is listening to your work or the work of others with a critical ear to find out _why_ and _how_ the music happened, what pieces came together to make it _just so_. This is sitting down with a piece you really like and banging away at it until you find the chord structure. This is listening to a session and thinking "That tune flowed into the next one because the first ended on the tonic, which served as the pickup note for the next tune, and it was really brought together by the fiddles' doublestop happening _just so_ with the new V chord the guitarist played."

This instructor had apparently suggested this to a comrade of his who was born into the Irish musical tradition, and he responded that to do something like that would be like studying a butterfly - an act which typically requires that you first kill a beautiful creature and place it on a pin, nevermore to entrance and delight as it once did. It's like watching a magician and figuring out how he does that trick you loved as a kid: unless you're one of those rare few who still believe in the magic after you know how it works, it turns something magical into something mundane.

My suggestion to anyone who wants to start playing Irish music is to make an ever-growing playlist of Irish music and listen to it non-stop. Steep yourself in it. For a lot of us (myself included), we're making up for lost time, so dive in and don't look back for a good long while (for me it was 6 months, nonstop on the drive to work, all day at work, on the drive home, and any time my wife wasn't at home). It's important to note that I mean this as a casual listener.

For someone who wants to improve their skill, or - as you do - wants to break the music down into its nuts and bolts so that they can reassemble it themselves, it's important to listen critically, too; however, don't try and do the two at the same time. Casual listening has a specific purpose; critical listening has a separate one. The two don't work together, though.

* **Step 3: Read up on modes**

A lot of Celtic music probably isn't in the key you think it's in.

One of the gents at the music retreat I linked to above teaches a class on music theory in Irish music. He has a chart he made showing the distribution of the top &lt;some number here that I can't recall off top of my head&gt; most popular tunes from thesession.org and similar sites. "Major"-sounding tunes were split fairly evenly between Ionian and Mixolydian (tending to lean one way or the other based on the tonic - lots more G Ionian than G Mix; lots more A Mix than A Ionian), but "minor"-sounding tunes were astoundingly _not_ Aeolian. I don't have the chart sitting in front of me, but it was in the range of 2-5%. The rest were overwhelmingly Dorian.

Dr. Chris Smith has some great [educational materials](http://coyotebanjo.com/music-group-28.html) up on his personal website, and I'll specifically draw your attention to [Modes and Modal Substitution](http://coyotebanjo.com/music-38.html), though there are countless other writings you can find on the topic as well.

Oh, and whatever you know about chord progressions, set it aside for a while as you work on new music. The modal - sometimes indiscriminately so - nature of the music means that many songs _can_ be played straight I-IV-V, but many, many more receive added depth and nuance when the chords are played without thirds, or when chords are substituted, or when chords aren't played at all, instead relying on a countermelody or drone accompaniment style. The choice of DADGAD guitar will help with this, actually. I promise I'm in no way related to or associated with Chris Smith aside from having been a student of his three years ago at the O'Flaherty retreat, but his [book](http://www.melbay.com/Products/97205BCD/celtic-backup-for-all-instrumentalists.aspx) on Celtic backup is amazing, and between his instruction in-person and following up with that book, I can honestly say I discovered how to accompany Irish music (I'm still working on perfecting it, but at least I know how to get there).

* **Step 4: Choose what you want to write**

If it's tunes, focus on the melody and ignore chord structures, harmonies, etc.

If it's songs, focus on the story - what makes a great song of _any_ origin is a compelling story. Once the story is there, treat it as a tune, above.

If it's _compositions_, take it a step at a time. Find the hook, find the melody, then find accompaniment. Celtic music survived for years without anything supplementing the melody, save for an occasional drone. If adding a harmony or accompaniment part adds nothing to the melody, consider whether it's worth it. Some of the most moving performances I've heard are a single fiddle, a single voice, a single bagpipe - for all its ornamentation, this is a simple musical tradition, and sometimes sounds best when allowed to be simple.

At the end of the day, it's my opinion that Celtic music is no less alive now than it was a hundred years ago - in fact, perhaps moreso. And by 'alive', I don't mean 'frequently-performed'. I mean _alive_, the same way that a talented speaker can make you see the future or relive the past through their words.

tl;dr - I'm a windbag, not a trash compactor. Read it if you're interested.

P-Funk isn't composed, it's grown.  You create a fertile environment, and you water it with emotion and you get funk.  Which means, it's based on a groove (on the one!), and whatever you want to put on that, you put on that.  George Clinton guides the whole thing in a loose way, singing a particular riff or countermelody until it gets picked up, running around stage putting his vocal mic up to particular musicians who are doing something he wants at the forefront.  As he says, "When in doubt vamp, or at least ad lib!"  Also, "ain't nothing good unless you play with it."  So play.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-09-27 09:02:24 keakealani<br>Well, it's not directly related, but one area of theory you can study is counterpoint. If the goal is to create an interesting, distinct countermelody in the bass that interacts in a consonant but independent fashion from the soprano/melody, then counterpoint rules could be very useful. That's one angle to look at it.

The other is to study harmony. Since bass lines are traditionally the harmonic foundation, it's very important to understand how harmonies relate to each other. As a pianist/guitarist, you should probably also be familiar with standard harmonic language, and this can absolutely translate to bass lines which exist in tandem with the harmonic movement. 

A third thought is to study figured bass. I'm not sure if you're talking about specific contexts where figured bass is directly applicable, but it's really an interesting place to study a harmonic language that is so focused on the bass line and the harmonic realizations on top of it. Again as a pianist this shouldn't be too difficult - most pianists I know have some experience with figured bass realization already. So I'd definitely consider revisiting that material, and in particular studying the way bass lines effectively imply harmonic function and what happens on top of that to reinforce the harmony. 

Beyond that, I don't really think there is any better way to learn about bass lines than to just study them. Is there a reason that isn't working for you?

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-10-22 12:31:13 xiipaoc<br>Which is more important, the guitar part or the vocals?  You can always turn the amp down on the guitar and turn the amp up on the vocals, if there's a balance issue, but if the issue is more conceptual, pick which one is the actual melody and write the other part around it.  Presumably the vocals win, so write the vocals first and put a countermelody in the guitar.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-11-06 03:54:41 -fd-<br>Actually there is a rule for 7ths (which of course can be broken). 

1. You can use the 7 if its in the melody (or countermelody depending on how you're working)

You can use a 7 whenever, except....

2. If the root of the chord is in the melody, don't use a major 7. Eg if you have a C in your melody, don't use a Cmaj7 chord because it clashes. Dom and minor 7 aren't such a problem because there is a whole tone between the 7 and the root note.

3. Generally, keep your 7ths diatonic. I.e naturally occurring from the scale.

As I said, this gets broken with wonderful effect all the time and some genres of music don't follow this rule. But if you start with this then when you break it, it will be intentional and you can start to use it for good effect.

There is a really useful jazz harmony workbook I can recommend if anyone wants it, just   PM me. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-11-26 06:37:57 SocialIssuesAhoy<br>Basically look up examples of polytonal music to hear it, Bartok's a good example. I think practically speaking, polytonality is a similar tool to synthetic scales, pretty much giving you a new set of harmonic combinations to work with.

For some personal commentary: try thinking about it as moving between consonance and dissonance more than anything else. Choose two keys ahead of time, and try to think about what consonant intervals you can get from them, and use those as "key points". It's really a mental exercise at first, until you have a comfortable feel for what consonance a and dissonances you'll have access too, just like you subconsciously do with tonal scales. You know that 1^ and 7^ is a major 7th, you can easily picture the perfect 5th from 1^ to 5^. Do the same thing with your polytonal scale combination.

Once you start writing, first of all I'd suggest writing a dual melody instead of a melody + accompaniment. Write a motif, and find a countermelody that compliments it, keeping in mind your consonant key points that you should have in mind.

I have a good little example for analysis doing exactly this if you'd like.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-11-30 13:04:06 -fd-<br>I think it's meant in the same way as people talk about modes in European folk music. There is polyphony and harmony in a general sense but it doesn't play the same role as it plays in western music. Consider even when someone looks up how to play a top 40 pop song. A common answer is to tell you the basic chord progression. But, some types of music just don't have this as a foundation because rhythm, melody, countermelody and other aspects perform that role instead.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-12-05 04:07:48 100001m<br>So counterpoint and counter-melody are the same thing? Could counterpoint/countermelody be beach boys harmonizing? Where each person sings a different note?

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-12-26 00:03:56 benfoust<br>I think what you're looking for is a way to accompany with a countermelody. What you're already able to do (every note hits at once) is called a block chord.

There's not like a distinct technique to creating a countermelody. What it really come down is listening and imitating the people who do it well (see major jazz pianist Wynton Kelly and Baroque 4-voice work, which is all counterpoint after a point). 

For the music you probably are looking to perform, there is a tradition that goes back to fieldsong and the call and response there. Check that out--it can't do anything but help you make better informed musical decisions when you do start executing fills.

Once you're able to hear what you want to do in your head then actually executing it will be a snap.

Already covered and good advice:

- Inversions—know 'em, love 'em, play 'em (I'm hearing inversion exercises in my head right now, lol)
- Countermelody—learn the scales and use them to fill in between what you sing; it's not necessarily about arpeggios, like you need to practice your scales so that no matter what chord you're on, you know what notes you can use to fill in between the vocal lines

Other tips:

- Don't be afraid to add 9ths, 11ths, 13ths, etc. to your voicings—it adds depth
- Left-hand can be a bit tricky—if I'm by myself (no bass player) then I typically double up on the root, maybe add in the fifth and leave out the root in my right hand voicings
- My favorite way of voicing and adding depth is using [upper structures](http://www.sonic.net/~jazz4/us.html)—you can get some pretty cool sounding stuff from that; start off simple and use the root + fifth in left hand and explore the scale you're in. Like, Db lydian is super fun, so Db + Ab in left, and C + G in the right. Then you can start to think about adding things like b13 or b9 or whatever.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-01-06 09:41:09 saqemex<br>If you are dedicated to pursuing musical production seriously in the long run (either as a career or hobby), I'd suggest actually taking the time to buy a piano method book and an intro music theory textbook and start from there. Sit in front of a piano keyboard and play through the intro method book, practice the exercises they give you. That'll teach you to read music and give you the ability to express your ideas though a piano. After that, take a look at an undergrad music theory textbook and learn the basics of four part harmony. Even though it isn't what you're trying to do, understanding why parallel fifths are bad and what "perfect authentic cadence" means is the basis for everything else in music and is important for you to know if you want your melodies to sound good.

I'd also suggest Paul Hindemith's book *The Craft of Musical Composition* if learning to write melody is what you're trying to do. Hindemith takes a very straightforward approach at easing you into the idea of melody and countermelody without imposing very tight restrictions (although his method is still based on giving you rules to follow). You can also probably use the results of doing the exercises in your songs.

Other people on this thread recommend youtube videos, which are fine and all for amateurs, but if you really want to write well, using classical method books is the only way short of paying for music classes (which will probably use similar books anyway). I'm not saying that the videos are bad, they just don't go into the sort of detail that you need, and are supplementary at best.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-02-10 21:28:15 andrewvanhk<br>The introduction contains a sustained I^13, with C in the bass. A short stepwise melody is played above this chord (e♭-f-g-f-e♭-d-b♭-b♭-a♭-g-e♭). You may have noticed that most notes in this melody are chord notes, i.e. they are taken from the I^13 chord. Non-harmonic notes, such as passing notes, are used to link up these chord notes to create a melody.

Next, Zedd introduces a rhythmic motif (8th note - 8th note - quarter note), which is used throughout the verse. This motif is used three times, the first time above a I^13 (C in the bass) -V^6 progression, the second time above a V^6 - I progression, and the last time above what seems to be a I - I^9 - vi^9 progression, with a extension at the end. This segment ends with a perfect cadence to E♭, with iii - vi^7 - V - I. You may have noticed that Zedd uses a strong syncopated vocal part, which contrasts with the conventional harmonic rhythm. He also uses the repeated piano pattern to emphasize chord changes by having it play the top part of the chords first, which have a higher tendency to change.

For the next part of the verse, Zedd uses a diminished form of the motif (diminished rhythm, not harmony) twice. The longer note of the motif is an anticipatory note, in the sense that it fits with the harmony of the next chord, but is placed in the previous chord instead, hinting that the harmony would change soon. The repeated motif is also part of a sequence, with the second one being a tone higher than the first one. The harmony in this section is I - V^13 (with F in the bass) - I^6. Placing a dominant chord with the fifth in the bass between two tonic chords, one in first inversion, creates either an upwards-moving scale or a downwards-moving scale in the bass. However, this technique is more common in orchestral writing. The vocal line then makes a leap of 7 scale degrees from E♭ to D, which then moves downwards in a more or less stepwise manner, ending the verse. Note that the verse ends in an interrupted (or deceptive) cadence, from V to vi.

Melodic material from the introduction is recycled in the chorus as a countermelody, above a vi - V - I - IV progression, which resembles the extremely common I - V - vi - IV progression used in popular music. This pattern is repeated 4 times. At the same time, the vocal part sings a melody, consisting of new material. Note that the vocal melody and the countermelody are completely independent. The chorus ends with a lengthy instrumental solo.

To conclude, Zedd uses the rhythmic motif together with motivic development to create the vocal line. He uses a lot of extended chords, which create harmonic tension. However, the harmony is quite straightforward. Syncopation is used in all lines throughout this song. Finally, the melody is mostly based on the chords, while surprisingly wide leaps and non-harmonic notes, such as passing notes and anticipatory notes, are used to make the melody more interesting.

If you're writing 4-part homophonic vocal music, like a Bach chorale, then the bass is the bass, the soprano is the melody, and the tenor and alto fill in the other notes of the harmony while staying out of the way.  If you're writing 4-part contrapuntal vocal music, like a Monteverdi motet, then there's no set melody, and every voice does its own thing, usually in its own range.  If you're writing modern a cappella, then the alto is one more color you can use; the bass pretty much has to be the bass, but the other voices can split the melody and accompaniment parts.  You can also write in more than four parts.

The way you're talking about it, though, you're trying to squeeze reggae into Bach chorales, and it's not going to work.  They're different.  In a four-part chorale setting, the alto and tenor are accompaniment and tend to stay out of the way unless there's some surprise counterpoint going on.  In rock, you have a guitar; you don't need an alto and a tenor.  Or even a soprano.  You have drums, bass, accompaniment guitar, and the lead singer on the melody.  If there's a countermelody, I'd generally assign that to the alto part, but whatever.  The categories you're using just don't make sense.

Haven't checked his facts (I analyzed "Firework" when that was big, but haven't listened to "Teenage Dream") but as far as using non-academic language and a conversational tone I think it's great. I could send this to my friends and they'd more-or-less get it. Better than if I explained it to them at least. 

Not sure it quite hits the mark of, "Why was this a hit? Let me explain!" 

With Firework at least it was a paradigm of modern pop. IIRC it was due mostly to the macro scale stuff: 

Single 4 chord harmony repeated in various textures, dynamics etc. for the entire song. 
Verse melody in quarter notes on the I
Verse countermelody in 8th notes on the V
Legato chorus on the I
Chorus repeats a short motif over pedal

Wash, rinse, repeat, add a bridge and BOOM! 

See P!NK's raise your glass for the same macro level elements. 
I did this with about a dozen pop songs a few years ago and was shocked at just how often the songs had only 4 chords and used the same structure. 

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-04-25 11:57:17 nlaeae<br>That sounds like a conflation of two different levels, though.  You can have main melody and countermelody lines from a structural/compositional POV, and then have the actual voices take on either part, switching their roles multiple times as needed.  Just make sure that the listener can always follow the melodies, i. e. the surface orchestration isn't too confusing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-08-08 11:30:30 xiipaoc<br>Well...  I haven't composed in a long time.  I should, you know?  I've been busy with other stuff.  In the past four years or so -- yeah, I guess that's about how long it's been since I wrote original music, shit -- most of my writing has been a cappella arrangements.  Most have been true arrangements, not transcriptions.  I'm also working on an ethnomusicology project which is *just* transcribing (and categorizing, etc.).

So how do I do it?  It usually just comes to me, honestly.  I get some idea and try to make that idea happen, and that idea grows into something much larger in a fairly organic fashion.  I'll think, "hm, I got an idea to write something like *this*", and I'll start writing it.  From then, it'll write itself.  Often I have some motif in mind already; other times those come naturally.  As an example, I'm writing a symphony.  Or was, four years ago.  I should probably finish the fourth movement, shouldn't I?  Anyway.  Writing a symphony.  When I started out, I wanted to write a bouncy happy band piece in 5/4 called Lemonade River.  It was going to be like a march, except in 5/4.  And in Bb lydian.  I came up with a happy-sounding intro and kept writing.  I made a little chord progression -- Bb, Am, Gm, FM7.  That's four bars.  Fifth bar, a continuation of some of the themes of the first four (many things going on at once there), ended up being too long by 2 beats, and not really so happy anymore.  So, 7/4 bar.  But the next bar had a countermelody that sounded like it was going somewhere.  So I kept writing, and this was obviously a fairly martial piece that was not a march nor a lemonade river.  I had been listening to Nelhybel, so hey, a symphonic movement?  From there, I figured I might as well make it a symphony, why not?  And so it went.  Every once in a while I'd write something I liked, and I'd reuse it.  One such thing was a four-note motif about halfway through the first movement.  It's fairly angular.  I don't remember what key it was in originally, but it's G# B G Eb.  There's no way that can possibly be tonal, which was the point.  Of course, later on I realized that you can respell those notes as part of the harmonic minor scale; in D you get D F C# A, the notes of a DmM7 chord.  So I used that chord in the second movement.  And so on, and so on.  It all grew fairly organically from that four-bar intro that was meant for a different piece.

I'm not sure how this will help you.  But there you go!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-09-12 00:51:47 BRNZ42<br>Big band writing is unlike voice leading in that it is top-down. The most important line is the highest sounding note, and all of the other parts work down from there. Unlike in classical voice leading, where each part is supposed to be an interesting individual part, the goal in big band writing is to have every part blend together and sound like one giant voice. 

In classical voice leading, parallel motion, especially 5ths and 8ves is heavily discouraged. In big band writing, everything is parallel motion. The basic strategy is to come up with the top line for a part, and then to have all the horns in that section play a line with the exact same contour as the top line, only on different chord tones. The effect is that it fills out the sound by playing all of the chord tones, but because it is all parallel or oblique motion, the parts blend together and sound like one giant voice, with the highest sounding note dominating the mix. 

**So basically, writing for big band is about two things: coming up with the lines themselves. Writing the melodies and counter melodies that will make up the highest sounding voices. And then learning to harmonize the voices below the top notes.** 

----
**Writing the parts**

Coming up with the parts isn't all that tough. It can be a fun creative exercise. Just think of it like a duet, or a point/counterpoint. You have a melody assigned to one section (or to a singer or a soloist), and then you use the other horns to contrast that melody. It can be a conversation or an argument. Have fun with it. But there are a few stylistic things to be aware of:

**Hits** are short loud blasts of a just a few notes at a time. They are little interjections to the melody. They are typically syncopated, staccato, and played by the trumpets and trombones. 

**Pads** are longer notes that support the melody or soloist. They are quieter and more subdued than hits, and are usually provided by saxophones. They can be as simple as whole notes that outline the chord, or more rhythmically complex and repetitive, but usually not terribly complex.

**Counter Melodies** are also common. Usually at the ends of phrases, these little melodies are like a response to the main melody. You can think of it as a call/response, or as a standalone melody. 

Let's look for these stylistic things in the example you provided (sing sing sing):

* at 00:30 we hear the saxophone section playing the melody, while the brass provide hits.
* at 1:10 there is a clarinet solo, providing the melody. But in the background the horns are playing a repetitive pad (this is a little more rhythmically involved than typical pads, but it's an energetic song). At the ends of the phrases of his solos, the brass fill in with a little counter melody. 
* at 1:37 we have a 3-part build up. Though all 13-15 horns end up playing, there are really just 3 parts. First the trombones start with a driving line, then the trumpets add some long notes, and the saxophones provide an 8th note heavy counterpoint. This sort of section would be composed exactly like a trio from a march. It's almost fugue like. But again, we're just thinking about the top part of each section, and we will learn how to harmonize the voices below each part in a minute. 

And it just continues on like this: sometimes the saxophones have the melody and the brass provide hits. Sometiems the brass has a melody, and the saxophones provide pads or an 8th-note countermelody. Sometimes it's a 3-part thing and each section has its own line. But throughout it all, the composer, Louis Prima, was just writing individual lines 2 or 3 interacting, and then the arranger, Fletcher Henderson, harmonized those lines with some simple strategies that follow below. 

----
**Actually voicing the damn things.**

Okay, so you've written some parts, and you know what the top voice of each section is going to do, and now it's time to harmonize it to fill out the sound. This is probably more what your question was actually about. There are several voicing schemes, but they're all pretty easy. Let's say, over a C7 chord, you have the following line in the top voice:

    C Bb E

Here are some ways to harmonize that line:

**4-way closed**. This is for 4 voices (ie 4 trumpets), and is the simplest way to voice a chord. The strategy is this: treat every chord like a 7th chord, and have every voice play the next chord tone down from the one above it. So voice out in 4-way closed, that line would look like:

    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G

By starting at the top, and working your way down, you ensure that every voice ends up following the same contour as the top voice (in this case, small move down, then leap up). Every note ends up sounding like a fully-voiced dominant seventh chord, so the underlying C7 harmony is strong. It really is that simple. We don't worry about voice leading, or keeping the common tone, or avoiding parallel fifths. Everything is determined by the top voice. 

But 4-way closed has a couple of issues. One, it is very compact. If you want a bigger sound you want to spread your voices out a bit to cover more sonic range. And two, it makes it a little hard for the top line to stand out. Look at that first voicing. The top note is on a C, but right underneath it is a Bb, just a whole step away. It is nice to give the top line some breathing room, so that takes us to our next strategy:

**Drop-2**. Drop-2 is simple, and it comes from 4-way closed. All you do is take your 4-way closed voicing, and change one thing. You take the second note down from the top (the "2") and "drop" it down an octave. So in our example we take the notes of the 2nd voice (Bb G C), and make that the lowest sounding voice, leaving a little space for the top voice. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    
    Bb G  C

We've now spread our voices out a bit, so this provides a bigger sound, and we've given the top voice some breathing room. "drop-2" is the default big band voicing, and the most common one you will use and come across. It sounds great, and tends to fall into the ranges of brass sections really well. But there are more strategies. Oh so many more:

**Drop 2-4**. What if you want an even more open sound, with all of the voices spread out? Then you drop both the 2 and the 4. For this voicing, you take the 2nd line from the top, and the 4th line from the top (otherwise known as the bottom line) and drop them an octave. This can be a good way to move into the lower register of trombones or bari sax, giving a loud and big sound, while still having high notes on the top note of the voicing. Here's what it would look like on our same example:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    
    Bb G  C
    
    E  C  G

**Applying these ideas for 5 voices.** It is common to have 5 players playing a cohesive set of parst like this, especially in the saxophone section (the standard big band is 2 alto saxes, 2 tenor saxes, and 1 bari sax. 5 total). The simplest thing to do is to find a way to double the top line an octave lower. With 4-way closed, this puts the doubled-lead as the lowest voicing. This is neat, because the melody sandwiches all of the other parts. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    C  Bb E

This happens to work out well because it means that alto sax 1 and the bari sax are playing the exact same part, and octave apart. The bari sax is an octave lower than an alto, so it amounts to them reading the same music. Convenient and cool. 

For drop-2 the double lead fills the space left between the rest of the voices and where the dropped voice ends up. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C

We basically wind up with a block of 4 voices in 4-way closed, with a gap and then a melody on top of that. Cool. 

In Drop 2-4, the doubled lead ends up sandwiched in the middle of the sound: 

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    
    E  C  G

This is a huge sound. You have a solid block of 3 voices in the middle, and a lead voice with some breathing room on top and a bass voice with some breathing room on the bottom. It's very dramatic. I'm a fan.

If you want to use it in your music, just have a countermelody along with the melody.  If the two melodies contrast enough -- if one has moving notes while the other has long notes and vice-versa, for example -- then you may have interesting counterpoint.  There are a bunch of "rules" to writing good counterpoint as well, which mainly have to do with avoiding parallel fifths and parallel octaves when you want the lines to be independent.  It's OK to *double* a line on the fifth or octave, but then that's doubling, not counterpoint.  If you're writing counterpoint, you should avoid doing this unless you're going for a particular effect.

There's also something else called species counterpoint.  Don't worry about it unless you're interested in 17th century musical pedagogy.  You may hear music students talk about counterpoint as if it's species counterpoint.  They're talking about a class they're taking or have taken, and not about actual use of the device.

By the way, just having an interesting bass line in your music would qualify as counterpoint.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-01-07 13:59:34 jason_stanfield<br>See if they offer a course on listening. It was probably the best class I took as a music major, but it's something that non-musicians could really benefit from. 

IMO, music can't be appreciated by just taking a class that gives you the bullet points of history or style. You have to know what you're listening to, and pick it apart ... to see the forest, then look closer at the trees that make it, then understand how those trees form the forest.

After taking that listening class in college, I started hearing things in music - patterns of chord progressions, melodic figures a thousand years old, variations, clever little quotes, sonic/musical "Easter eggs", and so on - that I never noticed before, even in my favorite songs and artists. I started getting little jokes composers would insert in their music, or understand how a beautiful countermelody was composed (often very easily), and really understand the mechanics of music that music theory doesn't cover.

Whenever I play out with my bands and we have a sound engineer, they always complement me on how easy it is to do my monitor mix. It's because I learned how to listen to several things at once, and even listen through louder sound to pick up something softer.

And my tastes in music have meaning since then. Before, it was whatever I responded to emotionally -- now, I can learn to like something even if it doesn't stir a visceral response in me. In fact, I tend to avoid that kind of music - I call it "candy" - in favor of something that I can hear some depth and cleverness in, and my emotional response is so much deeper and nuanced than "this is great!" vs. "ugh, lame".

The main difference I would say is typically a countermelody is not going to share the same 1:1 species of counterpoint in normal harmonization. The strongest example where this happens a ton is the popular ending to Les Mis "One Day More". That ending sequence when all the leads are singing their own independent lines, yet lining up in sequence with each other perfectly, is a prime example of a countermelody. While the rhythms are different for each, they work when stacked up with each other. Whereas when we hear the word "counterpoint", we tend to think of the adjacent harmonization of the line being heard.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-02-03 04:31:13 DaveCouture<br>countermelody is a colloquial term that doesn't mean anything specific. It just means two melodic line playing near each other.

whereas counterpoint has a specific goal, independence of multiple voices. It has specific rules and it's the foundation of classical harmony. its the first thing you need to learn if you plan on studying classical music.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-03-05 07:52:37 Morgoth714<br>Writing for multiple instruments is pretty much the same as writing for a single instrument, but your range is typically far beyond the range of a standard instrument (aside from something like piano) and you have a lot more "hands" to play the notes - thus you have to consider the chord from a multiple octave perspective. 

Generally how typical (non-inverted) chords work (from a modern perspective) is the root note is at the very bottom, sometimes doubled an octave higher, and then usually you have your fifth, and then any number of inversions of the rest of the chord higher up. 

For example, let's say I had a pad that plays a C major chord (and lets assume it's a playable part by one person so we only have two hands). I might do C2-C3 in the left hand and G3-C4-E4 in the right hand. Now, let's add a bass instrument (usually a single note instrument). It would likely play either C1 or double C2 depending on its sound - If it's a moving bass line it might arpeggiate C chord notes or if you're a good writer you might be able to get it to do more interesting stuff. Then on top of all that you might add your melody and countermelody/harmony/whatever else lead pads which play stuff in C major - they don't have to emphasize chord tones, but usually they do at least partially. Then you add rhythms and drums in to make it unique and interesting, which is probably more important than anything else.

The hard part is doing this successfully with multiple chords and intricate lead lines. That simply takes practice and a good ear.

Really depends on who your singers are, doesn't it?  If you have two sopranos, you probably wouldn't want to make your countermelody voice a tenor.  Just saying.

&gt; Or i need to pay attention to bass too, to avoid clashes between counter melody and a bass?

Try writing without avoiding clashes with the bass and see how it sounds.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-03-27 06:40:08 TravellingJourneyman<br>If you're still at the point where you're asking these kinds of questions (which is fine because we all had to work through this phase of our education), you should write each voice in a different voice part. If you're given a bass and a soprano, make your countermelody either a tenor or an alto.

If you plan on all three voices sounding at the same time, yes, you need to consider how they all sound together.

How are you studying counterpoint? Do you have an instructor, a class, just a book you're learning from?

Nope.

You write whatever sounds good.  That's really about it.  Music theory will help you know what sounds good.  If you learn music theory, you'll learn to recognize better alternatives and problems.  For example, you'll start hearing parallel fifths and be able to avoid them (unless you're using them on purpose, obviously).  You'll get a feel for what chord goes well next, as well as how to best write a countermelody.  Stuff like that.  As a composer, music theory is a way for you to stimulate your imagination.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-05-24 06:54:10 xiipaoc<br>I once wrote a piece for my brother's brass quartet where the second trumpet had the melody, marked *ff*, and the first trumpet had a harmony part, marked *f*.  The group must have thought it was a mistake, because they played the first trumpet part louder than the second.  What does that tell you?

So a melody usually has longer phrasing and its notes "make sense" by themselves.  You can usually tell whether something is the melody by those characteristics.  For example, a melody *probably* won't have a cadence that goes 1 - 7 - 5 or 5 - 4 - 3, because those don't really make sense, but it may well have 3 - 2 - 1.  If you have a line with regular rhythm or that is clearly part of an accompaniment, it's probably not the melody either.  If you have two lines with different rhythms that both feel like they might be melodies -- they have long phrasing and the notes make sense on their own -- they probably are!  Sometimes one of them is the melody and the other is the countermelody, and you can tell that this is the case only by context.  If a melody plays once, then it plays again much softer while another melody comes in very loud, then that very loud melody is a countermelody, not the main one!  If two lines have the same rhythms and both might be melodies, and you can't decide whether one of them has notes that make more sense by themselves than the other, the winner is going to be the one that is more audible.  That could mean louder, or it could mean higher, or it might be from instrumentation, or something.

Bouzouki players (again, since the 1960s) are pretty much expected to be doing constant countermelodies and guitarists commonly are playing bass countermelodies under largely non-functional accompaniment chords.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-10-14 09:30:45 nlaeae<br>We should really have a FAQ about this.... Anyway, the basic procedure (very simplified ofc.) goes like this:

First, spot the "chord tones" in your melody.  These are the notes that are structurally relevant in the melody, as opposed to flourishes that are just there to spice it up.  In fact, these 'chord tones' are not supposed to be entirely arbitrary; when you play them (without the "flourishes") they should outline the same melody in a very simplified, 'barebones' form, with a highly consistent rhythm.  As a general rule of thumb, the chord tone will usually occur on a strong beat, and even when this isn't the case you can often tell, as the line will sound highly syncopated.

Now, you can just use the chord tones you picked out in your melody as a 'reference', as if they were actual chord notes, and start filling in your harmony.  Choose chord notes in the harmony part according to their consonance, smooth voice leading and broad consistency with what the melody is doing structurally.  It's especially important to have a smooth countermelody in the bassline, so choose these notes with care.  (There are some more things you should be aware of, but for these you can just refer to the section on harmonizing four-part chorales in your favorite music theory text.)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-10-14 10:29:30 Albert3232<br>thanks man i understood what you said except the " have a smooth countermelody in the bassline" thing mind explaining?

If I recall correctly, John Williams and George Lucas specifically revived the Fox fanfare for this purpose.

The piano riff divides the 32 sixteenth notes of the two bar phrase into the grouping of 5 5 3 5 5 4 5, which adds up to 32. The drums play off of these accents, superimposing a lilt groove on the 5 subdivision parts, which is common of a 5 subdivision groove, but then the drums do other things for the 4 and 3, giving the beat a less constant feel. The verse part uses most of these same accents, but eliminates every accent on the second of a double 5.

At the end of the song they are very much combining subdivisions of 3 and 5 in very off putting ways, but I haven't listened hard on that part of the song. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-12-12 09:40:34 TheChurchofHelix<br>I think you should expand the chord progression somewhat. What you have now is a great I - ii - IV - vii^(o), although that C#^o can be seen as a substitution of A7, the dominant of D.

What I would do is make an AABA form - you have this lovely simple motif, so repeat it once, do something different, then repeat it again. 

An example progression: 

D^M7 E^m7 G^M7 C#^o

D^M7 E^m7 G^M7 A^7 - same as the top, but with the A for a strong cadence

B^m7 F#^m7 C#^o  A^7 - deceptive cadence to vi, then iii^7 vii^o V^7

D^M7 E^m7 G^M7 D^M7 - back to the original statement, with a plagal (amen) cadence to end on tonic.

With such a simple arpeggiated countermelody, I think it's good that you gave each chord many measures, so that they can breath. 2nd movement of the Moonlight Sonata is a similar setting that I would give a listen to.

RE: basslines - there are many things you can do. I wouldn't have your bass arpeggiate - the guitar is already doing that, and it will make the background too heavy; especially against such a delicate instrument as the ocarina. Playing on only the downbeat gives you a 40 bpm 12/8 feel. Just the roots are cool, but don't forget your inversions - sometimes the 3rd or the 7th works as a leading tone into the next chord. You usually shouldn't put the 5th in the bass unless you are following one of the [*very specific*](http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/61) uses of a second inversion chord - chords with the 5th in the bass usually feel very unstable and want to resolve, even if the chord isn't dissonant at all.

#EDIT:

You can use a [first-inversion Neopolitan chord](http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/121) (major chord based on b2 - E^b for this piece) in place of either the ii^o or the IV. Food for thought.

Next i have a flut come inn while my melody and harmony are going on, and it plays something totally different then either my melody or harmony, but its not neerly of the same importance as the melody is, in fact its more of a support much like the harmony is. Next ill have a choir come in and sing something different then my flute, different from my melody, and different from my harmony. Neither the flute nor the choir were as important as the melody, or even the harmony, but they each had a seperate supporting role that complimented the harmony and melody nicely, and yet they were both indapendent. My question is what wouod these be? Are they seperate harmonies, or are they a sort of countermelody like counterpoint. Or if neither of the two what would they be? 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-18 00:50:03 nmitchell076<br>Partwriting a basic classical texture is not that difficult, actually. Especially if you go by "The Vinci Method" 

That is: a melodic instrument, a second line that moves *mostly* in parallel thirds or 6ths with the melody, and then your bass line. You can either do this with Vln. 1 &amp; 2 on melody, Vla on countermelody, and continuo on bass line. Or put Vln 1 on melody, Vln 2 on countermelody, and have the viola and continuo do the bass line (viola an octave above the cello, of course). Of course, there's more to orchestration than this, however, these two textures are the basic fallback options. 

For your material, I don't think it's best to think about melody and harmony as being entirely separate, but actually as a unit. Classical music is built up from these stock formulas of melodic/harmonic units (we call them schemata). For instance, a [Romanesca](http://storage.gmth.de/zgmth/images/11719) followed by a [Prinner](http://storage.gmth.de/zgmth/images/11720). Try playing the Romanesca in quarter notes followed by the Prinner in eighth notes (including the 5 bass note!), and you'll have a good opening gesture for a classical piece! You can learn about these schemata here: http://openmusictheory.com/schemataSummary.html (this is a summary chapter, other chapters from the textbook go into more detail). 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-18 06:36:13 headless_bourgeoisie<br>Listen to super Nintendo tracks: you have a melody, a countermelody, and a bass line (and percussion). That's the core of most classical music.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-02-02 05:35:15 xiipaoc<br>It's actually really easy.  The most important notes in the melody are in the chord, so you pick a chord that has them.  For example, if your melody goes D B G B D G, you *may* want to play a G major chord!  For relatively simple melodies, this is really obvious.  The other thing to keep in mind is the overall chord progression; if you know what makes sense -- you know, just the basic progressions, what usually goes where, etc. -- you can figure out which chord to play.  Finally, there's some degree of ambiguity as well; there may be many different possibilities, and if you can compose something interesting on the fly, which is *not* really easy, you can do cooler stuff.  For example, with the D B G B D G melody, instead of a G major chord throughout, you can play this countermelody: D B G G F# E.  For the last three notes, that would imply G major, D major or B minor, E minor.  How does this melody go on?  B A G B C# D.  The simple harmonization would be G major for B A G B, then A major for C#, and D major for D (that's a V - I in D).  You can get a bit more interesting: B7 for B A, then Em for G B, and then A7 for C# and D major for D, which goes to D7 then G in the next bit.  You see how this works?  You have to basically compose a harmonic progression under the melody, but any simple enough melody already gives you most of what you need -- that's why it's a simple melody!

"It is composed in the key of A major and is set to the tempo of Moderato at 86 bpm. One Day More is a choral piece featuring many solos from the main characters of the stage show, all of whom sing in a counterpoint style known as dramatic quodlibet, featuring parts by the ensemble. The song borrows motifs and themes from several songs from the first act.

Each character sings his/her part to a different melody at the same time (counterpoint), before joining for the final chorus:

Valjean picks up the melody of "Who Am I?" without any changes (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
Marius, Cosette and Éponine sing to the melody of "I Dreamed a Dream" with Éponine's taking the bridge ("But the tigers come at night", sung by Éponine as "One more day all on my own") (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs, modulating to F# minor, G minor for high toned TVs)
Enjolras repeats the bridge melody of "I Dreamed a Dream" but in a major key, with Marius singing a minor countermelody. (C major, Db major for high toned TVs)
Javert sings to the already often-used theme from "Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven" or "Fantine's Arrest", only slower and in a major key. (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
The Thénardiers sing to a slightly changed melody from "Master of the House" (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
The revolutionaries repeat the bridge melody of "I Dreamed a Dream" in a major key with a counter melody that is only instrumental in Fantine's solo. (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
At the end of the song, everyone sings the melody of "Who Am I?" (C major)"

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-04-25 00:21:14 xiipaoc<br>That makes no sense.  "A2" and "A3" can be chord names, probably meaning two-note chords -- A2 would be A B, A3 would be A C#, A4 would be A D, A5 would be A E, A6 would be A C# E F# because fuck patterns -- or perhaps A2 and A4 can mean sus2 and sus4, respectively -- but that's totally not what's going on here.

So my guess is that they needed names for the second and third chords and picked "A2" and "A3" for some reason.  If you use them, nobody will know what you're talking about.

What's going on here, musically, is there's a chromatic line going E F F# G over the A major chord.  The chord with the F and with the F# aren't really separate chords; they're still A major, but there's a countermelody in the guitar part.  If the music were written in normal notation, this would be really easy to write, but since only chord symbols are being used, they needed to get creative.

* The rhythmic interaction between the bass other voices is key. 
* Make the bass melodically strong or it's wasted.
* But it's good to disregard both of these things temporarily in intros and stuff.
* Because rhythm is so key, it's usually helpful if at least one voice plays short, rhythmic notes, and it's always in your interest to consider the rhythm made by where notes *end*.
* You've actually got more resources than you need, not fewer. A single bass voice and higher melody is plenty for great music. 90% of the time noise channel and the other melodic voice could be used only for decoration.
* Techniques like simulated echo and tracker arpeggios are a great way to make a tune pop after you've got it working on a basic level. Likewise volume automation.

It really boils down to laying down a good melody and countermelody (in whichever order you like), then using your knowledge of synthesis tricks to make the track more expressive.

#Regret 

The first four chords are 

    Cmaj - Fmaj - Gaug - Cmaj

Or

    I - IV - V+ - I

The melody leads the way into this unusual progression including an augmented chord.  The melodic line is

    E - F - D# - E

Here, the "dark" sound is coming from the augmented chord, which is a chord made up of two major third intervals, and the unusual chromatic motion of the melody.

#Valentine

The first two chords are

    Gmaj - Emaj+6

Or

    I - vi(add6)

This time the "dark" sound is coming from a simple minor chord with an added major seventh scale degree on top.  The movement in the left hand fools your ear a bit though, since the bass note is E and the piano chord on top is made up of the notes G B C#, which is enharmonically a Gdim chord.  Still not the same method as the one in Regret, not also a chord not often heard in modern pop music.   This is again accomplished through unusual chromatic movement in the melody.  The melodic line is moving in this case from D-natural down chromatically to C-sharp.

Chromatic movement in the melodic line above unusual diminished or augmented chords appears to be the key to the sound you enjoy in her music.  

Check out the way the countermelody line moves down chromatically in "Limp" for a similar, typically Fiona Apple sound.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-06-25 00:27:45 Phrygiaddicted<br>&gt; There are songs that go from, for example, IV to V. In CMaj, just back and forth between FMaj and GMaj with the melody clearly in CMaj.

Seems pretty indicative of mode to me, not always though, of course.

But a major *melody* is not on it's own indicative of the key neccesarily: you can write a major melody at the 10th harmonised over "vi" in an otherwise minor harmony, you can do the same over IV at the 12th. Ionian melodies at the 10th over an aeolian harmony is pretty common. A melody starting and ending on C, can be harmonised to start and end on I, vi or IV, no problem. This gets more restrictive the more individual melodies you have, for example a melody and countermelody starting and ending on A and C respectively could be harmonised as vi or IV...

By the way, V-IV, and iii-IV are pretty *lydian* movements.

Maybe i should have phrased that slightly differently: "if you have a progression in C major, that never uses the I chord, then it is *probably* not *particularily helpful to view it as* C major.

More or less. There's infinite variation on it, but that's the basic framework.

&gt;would you say that quartets usually don't have chords in the traditional sense?

In the sense that there's not big fat block chords, no chords. But they are readily apparent, they're just played as some kind of pattern, more often than not.


&gt;Also, is the Viola generally playing in unison with Violin II, or are they playing different countermelodies?

Often parallel motion, rarely unison.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-07-26 18:02:32 xiipaoc<br>&gt; it seems like you would either do four voice counterpoint or have the first violin play the melody and the rest act as harmonic accompanyment

But that would be *boring*!  Why would they do that?  I mean, yes, Mozart was boring as all hell, but not *that* boring.  Remember the Classical period was a (fairly) long time ago, but people weren't actually stupid back then.  (Well, maybe some were, but whatever.)  There's no reason to be so limited.

The best way to think about a quartet, in my opinion, is as a large ensemble, not a small one.  You can write basically orchestral music, so long as it fits in those four voices.  The four players don't have assigned roles, like the basso continuo did in the Baroque period; there's no reason to do that.  You can easily fit a melody, a countermelody, and accompaniment into those four voices, and if you look, that's pretty much what they did.  They didn't do full four-voice counterpoint because that was not a texture they were particularly interested in developing, but they did plenty of two-voice counterpoint with accompaniment, for example.  And you can do even more.  You can take the essence of imitative counterpoint -- different voices playing the same thing -- and take out the actual counterpoint.  Just state a theme in the second violin, restate it in the viola while the second violin goes back to playing eighth notes or something, then restate it in the first violin, and finally in the cello.  Or you could have some other scheme.  In that era, composers were quite fond of actually giving the first violin all the good parts.  I try to never do something that crazy when I write music; I write for a cappella, and if I have SATB with no solo, that melody gets fucking *shared*.  Not yours, sopranos!  DEFINITELY not yours, first violins!  On the other hand, I sing tenor, so... by "shared" I mean "the tenors have it most of the time".  I didn't say I share *equitably*!

You may think of the Classical period as rigid and unimaginative, but it really wasn't so rigid.  (Ba dum tsh.  MOZART BURRRRN!)  I recommend looking at some scores and doing a motivic analysis.  At each point, figure out what each instrument is playing.  Is it just background 8th notes, the harmonic accompaniment you mentioned?  Is it a melody or counter melody?  How does that get passed from part to part?  What the fuck is that weird symbol on the viola staff, and why do the notes not make any sense?  (I still haven't figured that last one out.)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-08-27 19:45:41 xiipaoc<br>&gt; V7/IV, which means the D7 chord with the fourth in the bass, or does that mean either the V7 or the IV can be played?

It means the V7 *of* the IV chord.  The IV chord is C, so its V7 is G7.  This is known as a secondary dominant.

&gt; What is the difference between IV and iv. I thought that upper case for used to denote major chords and lower case for minor chords?

That is correct.  IV is C and iv is Cm.

&gt; but those notes don't HAVE to be the highest note in the chord to denote a melody?

That's right, they certainly don't!  In this case, you have something called a countermelody, which is a melody secondary to the main melody.  Actually, I'm not sure that the descending line even makes it that far -- it's just a descending line.  It's just that lines like this are really prominent.  If you were playing this with a band, you can bet that the trombone player or someone would play it, scooping into each note.  By the way listen to this, specifically the second time through the melody, when the muted trumpet does it:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q0zZ0VdlUM

Third time the banjo plays it, but it's kind of left out during the other solos (clarinet, trombone).  Then there's a sung chorus, and the singer himself does it!  There's a *different* chromatic line in the piano during the second time through the trumpet solo later on.  (By the way, I'm enjoying the hell out of this clarinetist!)  Last time through the trumpet does it again.

Did you notice that the very first time through -- but not the other times -- the chords at the end of the second phrase were ii - V instead of just V - V?  It's a very valid option!

&gt;By the way listen to this, specifically the second time through the melody, when the muted trumpet does it

By does 'it', do you mean play the countermelody? Because what I hear is many many different melodies throughout the song all based on the original structure set by the main melody.

Now, this might imply full chords when paired with the original melody, but at each point in the song, there's usually only 1 or 2 distinct pitches being sounded.

Bar 2 forms an A5 chord, which implies Am, given the other notes in the song, and that sounds to me like the tonic. Bar 4 forms an Fomit5 chord, which implies Fmaj (the bVI chord), and then we're back to the tonic in bar 6. The rest is kind of vague, and could be interpreted differently depending on how you look at it.

Hope that helps.

1. Choose *any* three seventh chords you like and write a melody having ii-V-I progression in mind (don't start it with the tonic). 

2. Write a countermelody to that melody. Don't think about scales or chords, there are [simple rules](https://music.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-contemporary-musicians-guide-to-counterpoint--audio-4630).

Or you can:

1. Read some Hindemith and write a tonal piece that is neither major nor minor

Also you can:

1. Write some atonal or post-tonal piece

Or:

1. Use techniques of minimalism

Or, if you feel adventurous:

1. Write a microtonal piece in 31 tone equal temperament

There's always a lot of new territory to break your habbits. Search for unusual, and you'll find a lot of raw material to get inspiration from.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-03-23 10:03:00 xiipaoc<br>Solo: one person alone doing interesting stuff.  Usually it requires other people to stop doing interesting stuff for a bit so that the soloist's interesting stuff stands out.  In vocal music, a solo is something sung by just one person as opposed to multiple people in the group.  In a rock context, we usually talk about solos for the non-vocalists because the vocalist is pretty much *always* singing solo.  So, for example, a guitar solo is when the vocalist shuts up and the guitar plays the interesting stuff, and a drum solo is when the drummer stops doing the basic beat and does something cooler for a while.

Melody: a single, important line.  There are many things going on at the same time in a piece of music.  If there's one instrument (or vocalist) that is playing one note at a time and that's important, it's a melody.  Usually, the melody is the most important thing in a song.  If you sing something, you sing the melody.  But you can have less important melodies too.  The important thing is that it's a single line -- that is, one note at a time.  If there's a second note, that second note is not part of the melody (though it may be part of a different melody).  If there's a main melody and another less important melody at the same time, that second one is a countermelody.  Melodies should also make sense.  You should usually be able to sing the melody (and you should usually *want* to, if it's a good melody).  If it's not really singable, it's not really a melody (as a rough guide).

Lick/riff: some technically interesting part of something.  Often it's a complicated part of the melody that's hard to play, with lots of fast notes, but it doesn't really have to be.  If you're talking about "this lick", you're probably talking about a particular run or little gesture or whatever; it's usually easy to tell between the lick you're talking about and whatever you aren't talking about.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-03-25 00:26:29 ljse7m<br>Under Control is a very loose example of harmony as a melody. It is more like a progression with the melody on top in a homophonic texture, in this case a countermelody with chords under the higher voice of the harmony. This one seems at least somewhat functional and I could tell more if I could hear the vocal track that has the main melody. It doesn't come through on my computer. 

This is not an example of Planing BUT harmony can be moved parallel to simulate a melody. That makes it difficult to understand the two mindsets you are talking about. 

I suspect that if I could hear it that the melody of the vocal would possibly be a contrapuntal line that is harmonized by the chords played weather functional or not. Maybe that is what you are talking about. 

Chords themselves are not melodic unless you consider diatonic or chromatic planing as a high texture melodic line which it certainly be in some cases. And as I said, you can have more than one melody and each melody can be harmonized and it is still counterpoint although it is counterpoint combined with harmonnic reinforcement. 

As to your last assumption, you and your listening friends may perceive chords as melodies but it is more likely that you are listening to the higher or more prominent voice of the chord progression as a melody and it is, but if that is the case, it is not the harmony that is the melody, it is that prominent voice that is the melody and the rest is harmony for that voice. 

when there is one note of melody harmonized by one chord and they have the same melodic and harmonic rhythm, it tends to sound like the harmony is the melody but in reality, unless everything is moving in parallel motion (all the voices of the harmony) it is MUCH more likely that it is just a melody harmonized with the same rhythm as the harmony. 

LJSe7m  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-05-19 12:00:02 ljse7m<br>Sounds like what I would call "parameters" as I see that as being layers of simple concepts layered over each other. But I don't get this from Schenker, its just how music is put together. 

I have never really understood how what I could glean from Schenker is anything but restating the obvious. Kodaly organizes his view of the concepts that define music into about 5 basic elements (depending upon how you want to count them) and these 5 elements are all very simple in theory, but become more complicated as one explores their various applications and combines them simultaneously creating multiple and layers of simple things to shape a more composite, seemingly complex whole until you sort them out. 

The thing is, when you try to do a "visual" analysis of these elements, the analysis becomes more complex than the music itself.  For example, if you start with a simple melody like even Twinkle Twinkle, you have one layer of the succession of notes with their rise and fall. Lets consider that one dimension. Then you overlay a rhythmic pattern and you have another dimension. If you then take the resulting or added harmonic pattern, you are getting into three dimensions. Now, when doing a visual, we start to have a problem. We are at the edge of what can be visualized in a two dimensional representation like a diagram. But we still only have a simple one line melody, with an underlying simple chordal pattern, and a time element of how these three (?) elements are combined. But upon analysis, there are various ways the melody and harmony. 

The melody however follows a pattern described as form and the way the motifs are combined create another "dimension" to distinguish it from another song using the same notes but there are simple shapes formed by these motifs that are undulating over the rhythm of the chord progression and if you happen to add a counter melody by giving a melodic shape to the bass line instead of just roots, the combination which is now, depending upon how you have been counting has progressed to at least four dimensions and possibly five or more and with the new countermelody of the bass interacting with the other elements we have several other things happening that has to be visualized in the diagram. We now have exponential progressions of concepts that need to be visualized. 

This is of course an extreme oversimplification but it is still a very simple song being complex before the addition of the secondary melody and then we now have more dimensions than we can meaningfully express with a diagram! 

But we basically have Twinkle Twinkle with a melodic bass line. 

If you try to put all of this into a diagram or a simplified score like visual representation, it gets more complicated than it needs to be but  that is what I get out of Schenker. Its simply more complicated way of trying to put too much information into ONE visual representation when a simple narrative to describe what a trained musician or theorist hears as a simple melody, with a simple chord progression and a bass line other than the roots. 

The only reason I added the melodic bass line is to give that unique element that seems to be necessary in a Schenker analysis and a chord progression with roots in the bass helps to show how the element of harmony can be just the chords OR can be two elements of the analysis with just that same simple variation of one of the previous elements and how even a simple chord progression can be made to be more complex as it adds the contrapuntal aspect to the mix. 

So this is the problem. Its not really possible to illustrate all of the elements that make the musical piece what it is. Even the simplest of musical pieces like Twinkle becomes difficult of impossible to give complete representation of what is there. That is why in a traditional analysis, there is a "narrative". After the appropriate analytical method is applied to the particular genre or style of the composition, a narrative is compiled to explain what unique applications of the composition contribute to his artistic merit. 

Schenker illustrations can be well done or not. I have tried to find another way of looking at Schenker but so far to no avail. To me, Schenker is more of a visual arts presentation of a traditional analysis and if you take away the visual aspect of Schenker, we are left with the traditional narrative part of analysis without the appropriate theory to match the music involved. 

He seems to be focused even in the narrative to want to paint a picture of what makes the piece what it is. I would hope that someone can tell me what I am missing with this assessment of Schenker. I do not proport to be an expert of his style of analysis but that is because to me, it seems to be dependent on using the traditional styles of analysis as a prerequisite for doing the visual aspect and I just find that too subjective to be of any real use no matter how beautiful it is. I don't think that he is irrelevant, just redundant. 

I think your narrative description is AT LEST as good or better than any that I have heard, but still, I don't see much that actually tells me how to create an artistic composition using the end result of the visual or computer generated representation of the music after it is created. 

Do you have any ideas of hot to Back Out of the abstract computational process to tell me how to create a composition? I still find that the concept of overlying parameters, each being depicted in musical contexts is something I can use to plan a composition in a much more pragmatic manner. I also think that we may be saying a lot of the same thing in different manner in a lot of ways although I don't see the "parameter" aspect to be separated in your short post. That, however would be asking a lot from a rather short reddit post 

Thanks for sharing you views on Schenker. It almost sounds like there is something to it! lol I do tend to emphasize the pragmatic aspect of musical theory and that is what I see missing still in this post. Maybe you will be able to point how Schenker can be used by the composer or improvisor where so many others have failed.

And if you do have multiple things going on at once, try your hardest to make sure they don't run into each other.  This means, for example, that you can have a melody in some high octave, a countermelody an octave lower, maybe some filler stuff the octave below that, maybe another countermelody an octave below, a bass part an octave below that, etc.  It's also useful if you keep things segregated by sound, so, for example, use thin metallic sounds up top, round brassy sounds in the middle, a fat bass, etc.  Try not to have too many different rhythms that don't fit together, also.  It's not a sin to have different sounds doing roughly the same thing.  Like, for example, if you have an electric piano sound doing some mid-range triad chords, you could always add a higher note to those chords in a different sound *in the same rhythm*, but softly so that it doesn't overwhelm.

The more different things you have going on, the muddier things will be.  If you want a clean sound, use less, not more.

And if you really want to learn about this, listen to 20th century orchestra composers (especially if they know how to write for wind orchestra) and study their scores.  Before the 20th century, people didn't yet have a grasp on orchestral color; the first violins just did everything.  But look at some more modern stuff so that you can get a good sense for how the different threads come together.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-07-05 09:44:13 ljse7m<br>Not bad! You can make that work. You have a good start. Experiment with some orchestration and possibly add a strong vibrato countermelody in between spaces in the song. You might want inject some more recognizable segments of the melody and move it in and out with some of the things you have already coming from the background to foreground and back and forth. But you have a good start on the creepy sound.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-09-25 07:23:32 hippomancy<br>Listening is a good first step, but what you really want to do is get into the score. I've learned the most from a composer when sitting with their music and labeling every structure I can find. In general, that means finding the form "areas", key of each section, cadences, chords used to modulate (if any) etc. If the work is for large ensemble, identify the role of each instrument (melody, countermelody, accompaniment, other texture), where doublings occur and what pitch and dynamic range each instrument is written in.

After that, try to rewrite a section of the piece, but with a different melody, in the same form, using similar chords and such. If you can do that, you can write like that composer.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-06 03:26:28 MiskyWilkshake<br>Well, it depends what you want them to do. You often see string quartets which are entirely polyphonic, with everybody playing melodies of equal importance, and you also often see the violins playing the main melody and a countermelody while the viola and cello support. It's entirely up to you, and that's the beauty of such a balanced ensemble. Likely you'll want to change it up mid piece and explore multiple different textures and roles.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-06 05:56:34 The_Original_Gronkie<br>Study 4-part harmony, like hymns, for a bit and you'll see how the voices are distributed - soprano, alto, tenor, bass. Sometimes the soprano and alto are harmonizing, with support or countermelody from the tenor, and the bass outlining the chord progression. Other times the soprano will be a solo line with the alto and tenor harmonizing and working with the bass to outline the chord progression.

That said, you are truly only limited by your own musical imagination.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-22 10:28:22 bloodhawk713<br>Countermelody is just when you have more than one melody being played simultaneously. For a pretty clear example you can listen to the [2nd movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHxmAsINDk) For the first 40 seconds or so there's only one melody. Then a second one comes in and they're both happening at the same time. If you want to see it visually you can look at this [piano reduction.](https://musescore.com/hmscomp/scores/296446) The second melody comes it at bar 27, where the right hand changes from bass clef to treble clef.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-25 03:52:24 Willravel<br>Not only is there a question of importance, but also dependence. While it's the case in a traditional understanding that polyphony means that both (or all) melodic lines are of equal importance, they are additionally not interdependent but merely in agreement. Countermelody often shares rhythmic, harmonic, melodic, and background material with the melody, suggesting more than just agreement. Polyphony can share some small aspects, but when too many are introduced it sabotages the independence of the melodic material. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-11-05 06:50:00 TheRandoxm<br>If you want to stick to the notes in the scales, there aren't many triadic chords you can play (suspended chords are not for this type of scales). But traditionally, there are other ways to accompany the melody. You can use parallel fifths, a countermelody, drone notes, or simply play it over I or i. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-11-19 14:21:40 xiipaoc<br>&gt; If I just pressed keys at random / slammed my face into the piano, you wouldn't call it counterpoint, so there are evidently some requirements.

I'm not saying that all music is contrapuntal, obviously.  But where you're worried about the rules of free counterpoint, what I'm saying is that there really aren't any; you should write whatever you feel like writing, and if the thing you feel like writing isn't counterpoint, then I don't know what to tell you.

&gt; This is not what people mean when they talk about counterpoint in this particular context. Rather, people are referring to something along the lines of baroque counterpoint

No, you should go back and listen to the music you don't think is contrapuntal.  You absolutely need to keep the bass and melody in good counterpoint, even if your bass is actually more like a cantus firmus than a general melody.  You need to avoid parallel fifths and parallel octaves between bass and melody just the same.  I'd assume that a lot of amateur songwriters don't really notice this, but they at least would notice that it sounds weird when they do it so they'd write their melody differently.  If you've ever written a melody over a bass line, you know what I'm talking about.  And even the rhythmic complementation is present, where you have a more active bass line when the melody is less active.

I think you're also looking at popular music too narrowly if you generally assume that there's only one bass note per bar.  Not all bassists are that slow!

&gt; By comparison, an accompanying bassline does not need much independent melodic or rhythmic interest, though it is nice when it has.

You might not think of the bassline as a melody, but it is.  Anything you can pick out while listening is a melody.  You should try to listen specifically to the bass in the music you listen to (you may need to use headphones or at least good speakers, since computer speakers usually SUCK ASS below, like, 100 Hz), and see how it plays with the melody.  Almost always, your melody will only sound good if it contrasts with and complements the bass, but you may not be thinking about that while writing it.

&gt; an intuitive feeling for how to write music comes with experience

Kinda, but an intuitive feeling for *what* music to write is something that requires inspiration.  It's not a mechanical process.  That's true for any kind of creative endeavor.  You start with a blank; what do you put in that blank?  You have to answer that for yourself.  And that's still true when it comes to counterpoint.  What is causing you to need to write counterpoint?  Do you have a melody and you're trying to write a countermelody?  That's still not a mechanical process; you need to *compose* that countermelody.  Rules will get you nowhere; how do you want your countermelody to sound?  Start with that, figure out whether it sounds good, and *then* you can worry about which rules you may or may not have broken in an attempt to figure out where to improve your composition.

Listening to music may well help you figure out how you want your countermelody to go.  That's true.  But that's true for any sort of compositional process.  What you need in order to write counterpoint is to compose all of the different lines.  That's not necessarily *easy*, but that's what it is.  Composition.  Not rule following.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-11-19 14:50:14 Kalcipher<br>&gt; you should write whatever you feel like writing, and if the thing you feel like writing isn't counterpoint, then I don't know what to tell you.

This tricky equivocation is at the center of the confusion. Writing what I feel like in the sense of going by my musical intuition is not the same as writing what I want to write. The latter is counterpoint, the former is not.

&gt; No, you should go back and listen to the music you don't think is contrapuntal. You absolutely need to keep the bass and melody in good counterpoint, even if your bass is actually more like a cantus firmus than a general melody.

I'm from a country largely without tradition of teaching species counterpoint, and when you examine them, many cantus firmi do not have independent melodic interest or completeness by themselves. For that reason, as you might suspect, when I showed my fifth-species counterpoint to my teacher, he was quite confused and didn't think it was contrapuntal. I am not saying this standard is the only reasonable one, but just that being capable of writing a bassline "in good counterpoint" with the melody is not necessarily enough to be able to write baroque counterpoint, canons, or fugues.

&gt; You need to avoid parallel fifths and parallel octaves between bass and melody just the same.

True, but you don't need to prioritize imperfect dissonances as a general rule, because your bassline is intended to complement the melody, which in turn carries the main melodic interest, but at least it seems you acknowledge the existence of rules now (though of course they don't necessarily carry the final word) Anyway, to be completely unambiguous, I am capable of writing a bassline that is similar to a cantus firmus in both imitation of baroque music and in contemporary contexts. In neither of those styles am I able to write a bassline similar to a fugal countersubject or like those out of Bach's inventions.

&gt; Kinda, but an intuitive feeling for what music to write is something that requires inspiration.

The potential for such inspiration is predicated on existing experience though. Somebody with no experience at all might want to learn to write music, but if you ask them whether they want to write jazz, metal, fugues, etc., they might give you a blank stare. The prevalence of pop music makes it likely that they will have experience with that at least, and so might be able to say they'd write pop music, but without familiarity with, say, Quan Ho music, even if that was what they would want to write given the familiarity, they are probably not going to suddenly be inspired to write anything in that style.

&gt; What is causing you to need to write counterpoint?

I want to work my way towards being able to write a double fugue for four parts.

&gt; Do you have a melody and you're trying to write a countermelody?

Sure. I have several even.

&gt; you need to compose that countermelody.

Which is where I get stuck, because my attempts sound bad, to put it simply. I can identify the problems, with the main one being no sense of rhythmic cohesiveness, which makes the countersubject sound fractured and not at all like an independent melodic line, but rather like repeated incidences of unrelated accompaniment.

&gt; Rules will get you nowhere

Seems plainly untrue.

&gt; how do you want your countermelody to sound?

I have no clear conceptualization for that. I don't have very good auditory imagery it seems, or at least not when trying to imagine something original.

&gt; figure out whether it sounds good

It doesn't.

&gt; and then you can worry about which rules you may or may not have broken in an attempt to figure out where to improve your composition.

The problem is solely with the rhythmic aspect. I was never good at rhythm, having literally no sense of rhythm (like with beat deafness) except when I'm very slightly drunk. Maybe I should just get very slightly drunk next time I want to write counterpoint.

&gt; That's not necessarily easy, but that's what it is. Composition. Not rule following.

Rules are a simplification, it is more about imitating, extrapolating, suspending, completing and violating patterns than rules. From your comment history, I understand you're a programmer. Imagine having to write a program to generate music procedurally. You might give it some parameters to vary and then otherwise go by strict rules, but that rarely works out well. Consider the difference between that, and a general artificial intelligence writing music. It's not completely arbitrary, and if I'm not able to understand these patterns, I will end up with pure noise. Musical notation and my instruments certainly put a constraint on the sort of noise, and with my current capabilities I can write something that sounds nice, but that's relying on broader patterns of tonal and functional harmony and doesn't help me with my rhythmic challenges.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-12-21 06:47:13 earsablissin<br>It might sound silly, but one thing alone hugely improved my songwriting - instrumentals. Often people think of songwriting as lyrics/verses/bridges/choruses. But actually that's the most limiting way to view them, and you only want those strict repetitive devices and sections if creating mainstream pop.


The reality is that interesting song writing, structure and arrangement is totally subject to the placement of instrumentals. Vocaless sections.


Think about it - instrumentals are small pieces of music that can be any length, any shape, bridging any section. They can divide a verse. They can dovetail a verse into another section. They can be big melodies, or simply holding a groove. They can be the verse melody. They can be a countermelody. 


The problems of not writing an arrangement with them in mind are huge - if you keep adding sections to an arrangement to fix the monotony and predictability of a verse/chorus, all those sections will have vocals. Introducing more and more ideas unnecessarily. Ideas that normally logically &lt;have&gt; to have a certain amount of time to play out with a rhyming scheme or narrative. Which means you end up trying to fix an arr with a section of 30seconds, rather than a section of 5seconds. And you'll prob have to repeat that again. 


Look at 50s jazz singers. They're songs are maybe 2:00-2:30 and have 2 verses. And they stand the test of time. The trick is - it's not what's done when the singer is singing, but when they're not. That's what to listen for.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-19 03:28:20 Phrygiaddicted<br>my point was more that attempting to use "classical wisdom" in chordal thinking and typical ideas of what constitutes cadences and such: will not work outside a very small subset of scales (and only 1 or 2 modes per scale).

anybody who has been like "HUH, why cant i do iv-v*-i in phrygian, why doenst it work :(, why doesnt locrian work... etc. should understand)

BUT that doesn't mean you can't write a melody, then write a countermelody, and so on, and END UP with a "chord" harmony. even a melody against a drone is a simple harmony though and you can draw implications from that.

(btw, locrian can work, but not if you insist on treating i* as a tonic chord, you have to avoid playing the diminished chord as i*, and use the d5 *melodically* rather than harmonically; then it's totally fine... 1-b5-4-b3-b2-4-1 is for example, a perfectly viable locrian bassline; and once you have a locrian bassline that sounds fine, you would probably never dream of putting that d5 above 1 harmonically because it just goes against the "spirit" of what you have already done in the bassline.)


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-23 01:15:14 gopher9<br>Alternatively: remove all chord tone except roots, rearrange roots to make a singable line, write a countermelody to the resulting cantus firmus (without careing too much about things like parallel fifths).


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-08 10:30:31 Firake<br>Music has melodies. When cool lines happen along side then it's counterpoint. 

Counterpoint often is introduced as a separate theme and then played on top of other themes. 

The main theme is the point, the side theme is the counterpoint. 

There's other stuff that goes into it and I think there's a difference between counterpoint and countermelody but this is as simple as I think you could make it.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-31 14:13:02 no_for_reals<br>Though I can only speak to 90s pop and rock, I can say for sure that /u/65TwinReverbRI is quite wrong saying that *"most songs use the same exact material they've been using since the 50s, or 60s, or 70s, and 80s etc. - at least for 'mainstream pop'."* 90s music is distinguished by more than just instrumentation, recording techniques, and "style".

The ♭7 is a big identifier of 90s music, either within a major key or in full-on mixolydian; it was never as common as straight major/minor, but it gained traction in the early 90s and fell out of style in the early aughts, and it hasn't really come back (Green Light by Lorde is, I believe, the only hit song in the last decade that really uses it.)

Waterfalls by TLC, Hand In My Pocket by Alanis Morissette, Back 2 Good by Matchbox Twenty, The World I Know by Collective Soul, Flagpole Sitta by Harvey Danger ("I'm not sick but I'm not well"), This Kiss by Faith Hill, No Rain by Blind Melon, Everyday Is A Winding Road by Sheryl Crow, and Jane Says by Jane's Addiction are some examples...the list goes on.

IV^add9 chords haven't faded into obscurity, but they were much more common in the late 90s than they are now, and if you end a song on this chord it will sound very 90s. They are often hard to pick out in the background, but here are some songs that use them very prominently:

Slide by the Goo Goo Dolls, Good Riddance by Green Day, More Than Words by Extreme, Stay by Lisa Loeb, You Were Meant For Me by Jewel, and Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind.

Boy-band-esque, super-poppy music would usually be in minor, and it frequently used harmonic minor (You Drive Me Crazy by Britney Spears, Spice Up Your Life by the Spice Girls) or a secondary dominant equivalent (going into the bridge of I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys). Often starting in the second or third chorus, the backup vocals would continue while the lead vocals sang a countermelody of sorts (Show Me Love by Robyn, The Hardest Thing by 98 Degrees).

V-&gt;IV is another trope that certainly isn't limited to the 90s, but it was more common then than it was before or after, especially within a I-V-IV or vi-V-IV progression.

Grunge and post-grunge had a lot more freedom from key signatures than more mainstream pop, with Nirvana being the most out-there (In Bloom just really can't be compared to any other pop tonality.) Plush by Stone Temple Pilots, I Alone by Live, Drive by Incubus, Only Happy When It Rains, Come Out And Play by The Offspring, and Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden all either change keys suddenly or borrow chords from outside the key signature in a way that doesn't fit into secondary dominants. (Dreams by The Cranberries is a rare pop example.) There isn't much consistency as to *which* chords are used, but there's just more flexibility if you're writing a grunge/alt-rock track.

I hope that helps you somewhat. If you have more specific questions, feel free to hit me up.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-05-04 12:52:48 all-thethings<br>Yeah I don't buy the F Lydian at all; A Aeolian (or C major if you want to talk about the V6-I as strong enough) would fit better. Just because the chord progression doesn't end on a chord that would otherwise be considered tonic doesn't mean that the chord progression is necessarily modal.

I went and looked for the score he was using, and if [this](https://memberdata.s3.amazonaws.com/pt/ptx2013/files/Run_To_You.pdf) was it, the second "I'll run"'s in the choruses (and some others) have a C in the soprano voice that jumps up to the E that's there, and it's kinda bizarre that this soprano C pops up in the last choruses in the sheet music given. There are also times when I wonder if the melody is actually that free or if beats are being excluded, but overall it has the main idea down.

The bridge reminds me of brass ensembles with the closed voicings in the ABB parts, with ST parts serving as a countermelody. It does remind me of a chorale in a way, with the homophonic texture in most sections and the theme lol

Overall, not the biggest fan of the style, but I respect what they do for sure. Thanks for posting!

Like, find some folk song from your culture and play it.  You'll have to figure out the chords and such.  Try using the wrong chords?  Like go way out.  Now try to add a countermelody.  Try to make the motion between the chords smoother.  Add suspensions and passing tones and stuff like that.  That's all you have to do to create music.  The key here is to make music by turning your theory brain *on*.

The other thing you can do, which is kind of the opposite approach, is to just kind of play random notes.  This is a good sleepy-time activity, when you're not fully awake anymore.  Play an interval and just listen to its sound for a while.  Move on to a different one.  Stuff like that.  You can learn quite a bit about music this way.  The key here is to make music by turning your theory brain *off*.

I like the first style when I'm feeling creative and I like the second style when I'm feeling perceptive.  You can surprise yourself when even you don't know what you're doing!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-05-31 02:32:24 Phrygiaddicted<br>to really get to grips with that, you need to know *why* ionian and aeolian are the preferred modes.

the force of tonal gravity you get from the collection of notes gives tensions that resolve certain intervals to others \(in the diatonic scale, it's 4\-7 \-\&gt; 3\-1\). I and vi are the triads that contain 3\-1 and not 4 or 7, so they are tonic, they resolve the dissonance of the scale itself. what you choose to "name" as "I" or "i" is irrelevant.

4 is then the subdominant side of the dissonance, and 7 the dominant side, 4 being contained in ii and IV, and 7 in iii and V. there are your subdominant and dominant chords that invoke the extreme ends of the scale \(4 and 7, they are the furthest notes from each other harmonically in the diatonic scale\)

since the point of a cadence is to set up and resolve the tension, unless you play the tritone harmonically \(ie, in V7 or vii\* or IV#11 whatever\), then you have to play two chords to create the tritone \(ie: IV\-V creates the tritone between 1/IV and 3/V\), same with IV\-iii or whatever. this is then resolved by I or vi. whether you play the sub/dom or dom/sub determines authentic vs plagal cadence, and whether the melodic focus will fall on the 7\-\&gt;1 movement or the 4\-\&gt;3 movement. V7 and vii\* in contrast play the tritone harmonically and do both at the same time.

so, your modes, you want to set mixolydian? well now you're trying to treat V as "home". you have to deal with the fact that it has 7 in it, and that i will be a functional dissonance against the scale. you will have to fight that to keep "V" feeling as "I". mixolydian is an exercise in tonicising the dominant. what does it mean to have a "dominant" in mixolydian? it's meaningless. it makes no sense. you are already on the dominant.

likewise, lydian has no subdominant. there are no notes in lydian undertonal to 1. it's impossible. because lydian IS the subdominant. likewise phrygian is basically a dominant modes with three flavours of subdominance \(iv, bII and bVI, some "more" subdominant than others bII and the iv and bVI having technically tonic function \(but subharmonic to "i/iii"\)

there are certain "tonal" tricks to make lydian and phyrygian express half\-tonic function \(that is, IV contains 1, but it also has 4 messing things up\) and iii contains 3, but has also 7. like using IV as a deceptive resolution in place of vi, as bVI/vi.

so you can use iii to sub for I and IV to sub for vi in a "half tonic" manner.

Mixo and Dorian cannot lean on this. \(tip: the melodic major/minor help with mixo and dorian ;\)\)

and this is looking at it from a functional perspective. pure modal writing will focus mostly only on the melody. after all: what you are trying to do is set up dissonance and resolve it at "home": if your melody sounds done on D in D dorian, and you write a countermelody/bassline that also sounds done there, then the chords they make will... be a dorian progression.

likewise there is no reason you can't write an E phrygian melody \(start on E, end on E\), the harmonise it in major \(or minor\)... because E is in I\(Cmaj\) and it's in vi\(Amin\), you can harmonise it as such. so the mode of a melody is not the same as the mode of the progression necessarily.

it's simple, and complicated.

trying to import the simplified idea of what "dominant/subdominant" means from basic major/minor tonality will *not* help you write modally, if anything will be counterproductive. every time i see someone call "bII" as phrygian's dominant, i die a little inside... because it's the subdominant xD phrygian HAS no dominant \(or at the best, it's bIII or maybe even bVI in a massive perversion of terminology.\)

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-07-19 14:51:53 shooten<br>In my opinion, the bassline can be considered a melody if it becomes the central point of interest of a section or if the whole song is really centered on what the bassline does and there’s no other important melody.

And the bassline doesn’t correspond to the bass as an instrument itself, I understand it as the lower note/line of notes/countermelody/melody (depends of the case for each one) in a group of notes (usually chords). For instance, play chords just with your right hand on a mid/high register. You will defintively hear a bassline, and it obviously isn’t playing a bass register. Same happens when doing chord melodies on the guitar/any other instrument.

And for an example of melody/countermelody on the bass, take any invention by bach. Left hand (lower voice) often plays a countermelody to the melody on the upper voice, but it always plays at some point the main melody of the invention, and the upper melody does a counterpoint to that.

Understanding themes (usually melodic, but also rhythmic, harmonic, technique, etc) is the biggest step towards being able to compose and improvise well. Start with a simple 2 bar melody of eighths and quarters; from there try going through a ton of different exercises with it, preferably by playing it on the piano in front of you, not written down onto paper. Some examples are:

- What is the best single chord to put under this melody?
- What are the best two chords to put under this melody?
- Write a diatonic countermelody that only plays on beats that the main melody doesn't
- Write a chromatic countermelody that only moves in half steps
- Write another melody that uses the same notes in a different rhythm, or the same rhythm with different notes.

Doing this at your instrument, and not at the computer or page, is critically important! This is to connect your mind to your fingers more, so that the music happens directly, you get used to getting feedback as you play it and can start over the moment you don't like the way it sounds.

Also, for understanding how to write romantic pieces, I'd suggest going back to theory and looking at those chromatic chords like secondary dominants, neapolitans, and augmented sixths, and the other thing to keep in mind is that the melodic/rhythmic figures tended to be much more curved/asymmetrical, if that makes sense, as opposed to geometric in a lot of classical and baroque. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-08-09 08:29:13 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;For me it seems like having basically all the awesome ability of a modern DAW inside your own brain. Seems worthwhile to develop. 

I would agree. However, I would caution that it is not an end in itself, just another tool in your toolbox, and I would go so far as to say in some cases, it can run into "party trick" more than useful composition tool.

But since I don't have the greatest hearing skills, who am I to say - probably the reason why I'm not a great composer!

However I'll add this - the most recent piece I wrote, for Trumpet, Trombone, and Piano, I distinctly remember "composing" the opening bars in my head while lying in bed at night, and had to make a mental note so I'd remember it in the morning. But the notes weren't specific - it was a general shape - I knew the two would be in counterpoint, I knew the rhythm I wanted, and the phrasing, but not the specific notes. That came the next day when I entered it in Finale.

A Guitar piece I wrote before that - totally composed on the guitar. Start to finish. Then I just entered it into Finale. It was "messing around" and "hitting an idea" and the right confluence of events and I wrote this little two page prelude in maybe an hour. It took me longer to enter the notes and tidy up the score than it did to compose it. But it was all "writing on the fly". There was no mental hearing other than "I want it to go here next..."

Another piece I wrote for solo Trumpet - totally in the DAW. I think I may have plunked out an opening idea in piano, but really it was written in the DAW.

Now - about the Tr/Tbn/Pno - I had worked out some ideas for note/harmony moves on paper and tried them out at the piano in my office and at home before I had that brainstorm laying in bed. So I had some idea of the "world of sounds" the piece was going to live in.

Also, for all 3, I really make use of the DAW in terms of organizing events - I write in a passage, play it back, and decide where it needs to go next. In the case of the T/T/P piece, which was slightly longer and more involved than the solo pieces, I sketched out 4 or 5 different sections - in fact I distinctly remember writing a section that had this counter melody I "heard" - not the notes, but I felt needed to be there - and I worked it out, but it just didn't sound right. I copied and pasted that section to the end and worked on the piece some more and as it developed I realized it was just too early to have that section there - it ended up later in the piece. So it's like this A section that the first time doesn't have the countermelody, but when it re-appears at the end, it does have the counter melody - which is the "right" place for it for me. So I did "hear" it needed this thing, but it wasn't the place it needed it in if that makes sense.

I'm not saying these pieces are great, or monumental, or boundary-pushing or anything like that. But I'm happy with them. I posted the guitar piece on a guitar forum to get some advice on notation (it's for classical guitar) and one respected member said "it's a bangin' little piece" which made me very happy.

But I didn't really "hear" them in my head. Nor can I really hear all the parts in a Chorale unless I listen to it through 4 times focusing on each part - and still may get the tenor and alto confused if they get too close or cross, etc.

But I can listen to a Rush song and tell you every single thing that's happening and with many pop songs I'll even know the actual pitches, chord formations and so on - because that's where I've spent most of my "ear" time. So certainly familiarity with a genre is going to be a big factor in this - if all you do all day is play 3 part inventions, sure you're going to be able to hear the individual parts better - especially if they're all of a similar style and with predictable elements and other clues to help you out.

Don't forget, Mozart's head probably wasn't full of Jazz, Rock and Roll, New Wave, EDM, non-western musics, Early Music, Atonality, and all this other stuff we've heard. If you had ONLY listened to Haydn growing up and never heard anything else, your abilities to pick out that stuff would probably be much better - especially if you PLAYED it too - and IMHO that's where the real experience comes in.

My colleagues that have these amazing "gifts" - well, they play Piano and have thousands if not 10s of thousands of pieces under their fingers - their experience is far beyond what the "kid with a DAW posting online" is going to be, and they've got thousands of hours on the instrument, playing music, listening to music, trying out things, and so on.

My ear improved DRAMATICALLY when I started gigging regularly in a rock band - because I had to pick up a new song every week. Then I got to the point where I was subbing and learning entire night's worth of music in a week or two. But you also get to try out stuff life, you have to listen more intently to what the other musicians are doing (if you, ahem, lose you place...) and so on. I'm not a real Jazz or Classical guy, and while pop music may be far more simplistic, learning songs by ear has been the main way my ear developed and I was working with a colleague last week on a Trombone Quartet piece (Bach's pieces from the WTC, Inventions, and things written for that ensemble) and I often surprise myself going "no, that's perfect 4th" or "no, there's the note we have to change the pitch of" and "let's gauge the tuning off the octave note right before it" and things like that. I've heard runs with 15 tuplets missing a note. I don't know how, but something just didn't sound "right" to me - often I can't pin point these things, but they're broad strokes - the pianist said, "oh, you've caught my error" and he corrected the passage.

I guess part of it is I'm an audio engineer too, so I tend not only to listen for music, but just sound in general - like I'm more likely to notice spit gurgling in a horn than a slightly out of tune pitch - so they're worried that the pitch is in tune and I"m like "we need another take, clear your spit valve" (which drives them crazy that I can hear that stuff). I did a choral recording where the vocalists were holding this long sustained note but one of them were holding their mouth in such a way that it created this weird "airy overtone" sound. The choral conductor heard the playback and their expertise allowed them to tell the player how to fix it.

So for me, there's more important things than hearing all the notes though I do that pretty well too.
But it's primarily a lot of playing and - well, I always say I don't "hear" things, I "listen" for things or to things if you get the distinction.

Since I don't need to replicate classical music, I don't need to be able to hear it well, other than to correct recording takes (and I typically work from the score anyway - but I can see what it was supposed to be and hear their error a lot of times).

But since I need to do that for pop music, I'm pretty good at it there.

When I compose, it's more broad strokes, and trying ideas - lots of sketching, and then "assembling" and transitioning and things like that.

I actually don't know that good hearing ability would help me because I would tend to fall into the same trap as "composing at the piano" where I'm going to fall back on things I already have heard, rather than trying out sound combinations without any kind of preconceived notions (other that what I might be trying to do in a piece).

There's no better system than a pair of ears. Get familiar with composing in each mode and experiment with chromatism.

Doing so you should remember that things may sound wrong not only because they are wrong, but because you *expect* them to be wrong.

Also, composing 1:1 countermelody to someone else's melody helps to break out of old patterns.

Believe it or not, having a simple melody and an elaborate countermelody is very effective, and is probably the more common scenario in contrapuntal music. Check out where the answer comes in during the exposition of [BWV 578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbox4oi6HjA&amp;t=17s) - At 0:33, there's a 4:1 diminution ratio between the countermelody and answer. Having a simple melody makes it discernible amid a lot of action in other voices. This is even more apparent when the subject returns in the bass at 0:50.

Long, sustained chords that hold onto the harmony in the background. Otherwise, you can use them as an extension of the trumpet section, give them a countermelody—honestly, I think trombones sound great playing a melody all on their own, either soli or tutti. A lot of times the bass trombone will double the bari sax.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-21 21:27:29 The_Original_Gronkie<br>I've played a lot of big band trombone, and the trombone works well for a lot of things. First of all remember that it is another color in your palette. The trumpets are brash and brassy, the saxes are similar but with a smoother tone, and the trombones are velvety and smokey. 

Saxophones tend to have the entire range covered, from low to high, just by using a combination of alto and tenor. In the same way, you can look at the trombones as the lower extension of the brass section. The trumpets tend to play up high, while the trombones play in the lower registers. So often they are doing what the trumpets are doing, when the trumpets aren't playing the melody. 

Other times they can be playing with the tenor saxes to give some solid weight to the arrangement. Otherwise it would only be the tenor saxes grounding everything, while the altos and trumpets were blasting away up top. That's especially important when the whole band is playing those big harmonized organ chords, when the trombones can double the tenors, and even play the super low notes the tenors can't reach, allowing those chords to reach deep.

In slower arrangements they are good for laying down long sustained notes for a harmonized bed for the melody and countermelody to play above. In slow and medium tempo songs they can play the melody. In faster songs they can play harmonized blasts, adding the tenor and bass parts to the alto and soprano parts in the trumpets and saxes.

They are also good for playing counter melodies in lower and medium registers.

They can also be good for occasionally handling the lead solo melody, especially on mid tempo songs, or songs with a more lyrical melody, giving your audience an aural rest from constant trumpet or sax leads, and giving your set list some variety of color. Think of them like a singer in the baritone or tenor range. Trombone players train to be able to play that lyrical stuff. Ask ANY trombone player about Rochut Etudes, he'll know what you're talking about.

The downside is that the trombone does not lend itself well to improvised solos. The arrangement of notes on the slide doesn't tend to work well for linear improvising, as the instrument tends to emphasize the harmonic overtone structure instead of scales. Occasionally I'll hear a trombonist that has figured put how to improvise around harmonic overtones rather than scales, but most aren't very good at it, unfortunately.

It's hard to ruin the major third. But then I write a countermelody in 12edo, I find *minor* thirds to be distractingly dissonant. I have to apply a little bit of extra effort to belive that minor thirds are actually consonant.

&gt; A neutral triad sounds no less or more consonant than a major or minor triad

I disagree, a neutral third sound less consonant to me.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-12 16:54:47 gopher9<br>&gt; I know music is a language so if you want to convey a certain mood, you choose a certain note, rhythm, etc. but I have difficulty doing this.

[Some composers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky) actually disagree.

To me, composing is not “writing down a mood”. Composing is the process of active *interacting* with sound. And music not only expresses itself, it basically writes itself.

Experience allows you to select constrains, to choose the music that will write itself.

So how do you write melodies? Well:

- It is helpful to choose a set constrains. So you cut off possibilities you don't want
- It is helpful to write melody first. So other elements of the piece don't meddle in hearing the melody
- It is helpful to understand counterpoint. Did you think of chord progressions as melodies working together?

There are some good exercises in “Composing Music: A New Approach”. You can find them in /r/composer.

There's also a great way to learn: counterpoint. You take someone's melody and write a countermelody that sounds good with the melody. Writing a countermelody is a creative process, you don't copycat anything. But because your countermelody has to sound good with the melody, you inevitably *abosorb* something from the melody.

If you are writing four-part stuff, then YES, you'll need that. If you are writing homophonic music with a melody and its chords, then no countermelody is needed, although your bassline will be, by default, such an entity. So figger out what you are trying to do, or BE with this or any other piece, and the next move will follow from that category. 88melter

If I had to classify the G7 as a borrowed chord, I would say it's the V7 from C major. The Gmin7 - C7alt can be condensed to a big fat C7.

So in that sense, G mixolydian would be fine, *however*, the core "countermelody" in the tune is C - C# - D - Db - C, and should not be lost. You could play F major over the whole thing, emphasizing the C#'s and Db's over the proper changes. This is in fact what the original melody does.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-31 00:04:10 gopher9<br>A melody has:

1. Contour (steps and leaps, up or down)
2. Rhythm (never understimate the power of rhythm)
3. Tones. Which are scale degrees with their own tendencies

In a good melody all of them are well balanced.

&gt; When i create melodies, i often begin by finding a good chord progression, and then "improvising" on it to create a melody; it sounds great, but as soon as the chords are removed (i cant have a piano, and my instrument isnt polyphonic), it sounds "random", because there isnt any harmony, and i love to have frequent modulations, which accentuates the "random" effect (and i dont like it, of course).

Reading about what is a good melody won't probably fix your problem. But writing melodies will. So try to start with a melody. And instead of adding chords to it, add a countermelody. And so on. Learn to see harmony as melodies working together (counterpoint) rather a sequence of chords.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-01-10 04:29:09 LiamGaughan<br>First off, turn them down. Turn your bass down too, and your vocals up.

Use better samples with more dynamic layers.

Maybe just stick to a countermelody line with octaves if you want it to have more impact. Block chords will sound more smooth, but also more boring. More of a layer than a standout moment. 

If you want a build from pre to chorus, then start the pre with less layers/voices, and add layers in the chorus, including a dynamic increase.

Adding chord extensions isn't going to help, listening to this you need to consider the arrangement and mixing first IMO.

Do you compose using different modes? Do you construct your own modes? Do you try to use [modal interchange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dRA28cdt5c)?

I recommend highly you listen to the full song in the first case and *all three* movements in the second. I have a lot of classical pieces I may enjoy more, but in my opinion Holst's first suite may be one of the greatest constructed pieces of all time. I could on forever about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Really notice how in the 3rd movement alone, Holst develops 2 completely independent themes that stand alone (that reminisce the 1st and 2nd movements also!), and then only at 1:51, he shows us that they belong together, and the holes and gaps left by one are filled with embellishments from the other. Truly remarkable.

A fully diminished 7 chord with a tonic of Bb contains the notes Bb Db Fb Abb.  If we assume the Abb is just a G then as a musician interpreting the music you might think the chord is a Half Diminished G chord.  This becomes an issue if you understand the nuances of your instrument and how you fit into the texture.  If you interpret it has a half diminished G chord then the the volume and even tuning of the chord could be interpreted differently from the composers intent and even when playing a melody or countermelody line its important to understand which noted fit in and out of the intended texture, so the way a composer expresses the note is important even if as a player it can be confusing to parcel out how to play the double flats and sharps especially when sight reading.

Another thing you can do is chromatic passing notes. Think of #4/b5 of the blues scale, or #2/b3, for example.

&gt; but how does it work because if we take notes from all the modes of C we will have the 12 notes so I don’t understand

But you don't use all of them in the same moment. You use a few of them first, and these few set the listener expectations. And until you don't break the expectations too much, you are free to change the territory as you want.

A tricky moment though: your expectations as a composer are different from your expectations as a listener. Knowing that some notes are “in the key” and other are “outside” might actually make you perceive some fragments as “wrong” even though they would sound good to you if someone else wrote them.

In any way, everything is a matter of experience. So experiment a lot.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-04-06 04:41:42 65TwinReverbRI<br>No, not really.

Countermelody refers to the notes, so two different singers could in fact be singing two different melodies, but using the same lyrics, and these would be countermelodies, or even counterpoint if a larger part of or the entire texture is this way (for example, most Renaissance sacred music uses the same text for each part, but the don't "line up" all the time because they are in imitative polyphony, etc.).

In older music (also Renaissance) the form "Motet" refers to a piece sung in more than one language, usually with different poems ("mot" is French for "word").

But I don't know of any term that describes the text part of the songs with different words where different lyrics are being sung simultaneously.

It's either countermelody, or in pop music, lead vocals versus backing vocals, and things like that.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-04-09 23:34:24 jroze_<br>There's definitely an art to choosing the right notes to double when you want to use four part harmony/counterpoint. Even when the music gets complex rhythmically you always have to think about voice leading with your progressions. Also, if you're only using triads you're missing out on a whole world of harmony and tension/release. Try to add your voice for your melody lines and use more complex harmonies like dominant or diminished 7ths or augmented 6th chords in your three part keyboard lines. I think you'll find that the possibilities are pretty endless.

Also, just because you have to double notes sometimes doesn't mean your voice melody has to be a copy of the keyboard melody. There's infinite melodies to apply to one chord progression, many of which compliment each other when playing more than one. Maybe try writing a more complex melody/countermelody for your keyboard part, possibly one that would be too difficult to perform vocally (large intervals or quick runs) that can compliment a straight forward vocal line.

Now think of another reason why they work. And one more. Examine the voice leading. Think the melody is particularly strong? Reduce it down to it's essentials. Check the antecedent/consequent phrases and the form. Label the chord tones and name the non-chord tones. Interested in the rhythm? See if you can reduce the whole groove down to something that could be played on one drumset. Break it down further: something that could be tapped out with two hands. Further: A series of numbers describing groups of subdivisions (3-3-2-2 2-2-3). Interested in orchestration? How would you reduce the whole thing down to something playable on a piano? What parts double each other? What voicings do certain groups spell out? See if you can label each part with a role (melody, countermelody, harmonization, accompaniment, etc.). It's a process of digging deeper and deeper into the specifics of what made you want to analyze a piece of sheet music.

I always look at it as a series of steps away from what I know when I'm considering picking up a new instruments. Every instrument falls into certain categories and every step out of a familiar category is something new you need to learn. 

To start, there is the obvious string/woodwind/brass/percussion. Each might seem more or less unfamiliar, but for all intents and purposes, no matter which you pick, you are only taking one step away from what you're familiar with. Out of all of the choices you need to look at, this one is the least important for a string player. Wind players, both brass and woodwind, do need to take this a little more into consideration, as swapping between two wind instruments can really screw with the quality of your sound if you're not careful. but you obviously doneed to worry about that. Pick whichever one sounds fun.

You also need to consider the genre of music you would be focusing on with that instrument. I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you play in an orchestra since you're a violin player. Well, do you want something that can still play in an orchestra? What about a concert band? Jazz? Rock? Again, no matter what you pick, it's still just one more step into the unknown.

Now you need to consider what role the instrument serves in the chosen genre. Is it mainly a melodic instrument like violin, flute, or trumpet? Is it a bass instrument like a tuba or contrabass? Is it a harmonic instrument like violas and french horns? While any instrument can be used in any role, certain options will tend to fill certain roles. If you pick something that is outside of what you usually play, that is once again something new you need to learn. Even beyond the specifics of the instrument, you cannot use the same phrasing on a bass instrument as you would on a melodic instrument. Harmonic instruments need to make sure they are loud enough to be heard without overpowering the melody. Rhythmic instruments need to be played perfectly in tempo. This is probably the hardest part of mastering any instrument. As a violin player, you might find it easy to pick up a flute since they play similar lines. You might find a tuba really hard just because you're not used to playing a bass line. Or, it could be the other way around. Certain positions are naturally easier for some people. Maybe you might find that you just know the perfect volume for a french horn countermelody. The only way to know for certain is to experiment.

The last thing you need to consider is by far the simplest and the most important. What sounds fun to you? Not easy, fun. If you are truly dedicated to learning a new instrument, none of them will be easy. Some might be easier than others, but truly learning even the easiest instrument take a lot of practice. It is more important that you enjoy whatever you pick, regardless of how hard of an instrument it may be.

Now, if you're still with me after that wall of text, feel free to answer a few of those questions in a comment or a pm and I can recommend a few choices based off of what sounds good to you. Remember, each thing different from what you already do is something more you have to learn, but it doesn't necessarily mean it will be that much harder. Like I said, certain things just click for some people, and you will never know until you try.

How would you have the concept roughed out before you get to the DAW btw, and what is a countermelody?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-06-30 09:57:04 MusicJohnston<br>Coming up with a melody at an instrument is a great start. But having contrasting sections (i.e. verse/chorus or A/B/A forms) is what really transforms background tracks into songs. Kinda like how most buildings generally have a bunch of rooms, unless they're big empty warehouses or little sheds. 
I would suggest diagramming your song out on a regular old piece of paper, section by section, until you have a rough idea of the how the whole track goes. And then from there you can go into the daw and record everything.
A countermelody is just what you might expect--a melody that goes counter to the main melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-07-01 05:10:28 expiredvegetable<br>Simply put, writing counterpoint is another way to compose. It presents a variety of new options, and has a very different texture because often the focus constantly shifts from one voice to another. 

For example Mozart's K545 is not contrapuntal. There is one clear melody supported by broken chords. 
In counterpoint, let's take Bach's Fugue 2 in C minor, we have multiple melodies. It's a very different texture, which you may find interesting. 

A countermelody is a melody that compliments the 'main' melody, usually through contrast. See also 'subject' and 'countersubject'. 

When we have two melodies we are also presented with vertical sonorities that suggest harmony/chords.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-07-11 04:48:42 gopher9<br>I would simply write a countermelody first. It will provide you some sense of harmony, so finding the right chords will be easier.

The bass line is moving and providing a countermelody to the vocal while the guitar is providing the chords underneath. So saying the bass is playing a G# underneath the A is not really all that’s happening. There happens to be a G# in the melodic line of the bass, which runs down and up from A to G# to A to B and back. The leading tone and the supertonic both pull strongly back to the tonic of A in this melody.

You’ll hear a lot of mixolydian mode (bVII) in ska and reggae music. Going from I to bVII and back strikes me as particularly common.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-03 22:47:10 Willravel<br>The uniqueness of similarities between the ostinati was a misrepresentation. 

His basic comprehensive analysis list or pitch, rhythm, texture, pattern of repetition, melodic shape, and timbre do not support the assertion that these two instances of a synth pattern are so particularly unique that one can be said to have been copied from the other. Similar in pitch? A countermelody outlining the first third of the key is extremely common, be it me re do or me re do. It's two chord tones with a passing tone. Similar in rhythm? It's monorhythmic, the most common rhythm in the history of music. Texture? Monophonic, also extremely common. Pattern of repetition? It's a 2-bar ostinato, also extremely common. Also the simpler a pattern in music the more likely you are to see it repeated in other works. Melodic shape? Descending is one of maybe three or four options. Timbre? As someone who has more than dabbled in sound design, the two synths are as different as an electric guitar and a flute. 

Individually, the uniqueness absolutely does not fly, however even in combination the argument does not demonstrate uniqueness. NYU music professor and musicologist Lawrence Ferrara was easily able to name other similar melodic fragments that met Decker's criteria, "Jolly Old St. Nicholas" (1867) and "Merrily We Roll Along" (1935). Adam Neeley did a video on this topic which found a dozen more examples which were far closer even than the two above. Given time, I'm sure hundreds of examples could be found. The synth ostinato from "Joyful Noise" was not at all unique, and nothing between it and the synth ostinato in "Dark Horse" was special or unique. 

But his misrepresentation isn't the central issue, rather it's the legal consequences of the outcome of this case. If this was just some debate in a sophomore music theory class learning about comprehensive analysis, his conclusions—while still ultimately are highly debatable—would only have the consequence of his students having to learn better analytical processes later. In this case, court findings can set precedent, so one bad case can become many. This has become an issue across many areas of law, in this era of the pay-to-play expert witness. The pay biases the 'expert', the testimony is above the heads of the jury so they take the expert at their word because the opposing counsel doesn't have time to teach the jury the specialty or expertise, and caselaw is established based on bad-faith analysis and biased expertise.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-16 20:14:10 gopher9<br>&gt; How do you stick with a musical idea even though you don't necessarily ike it?

It's not like everything must be fancy in a song. You can make a boring melogy interesting by adding some rhythmic interest or fancy harmony, and vice versa, a simple harmony or straight rhythm can play well with a good melody. And there's also arrangement, sound design...

&gt; How do you even come up with them?

There are two ways:

1. You try things and find something cool
2. You borrow something cool from somewhere

You should of course do both. There's an exercise you can do:

1. Take someone's else melody
2. Write a countermelody (bass line) to the melody
3. Remove the original melody and write you own melody over the countermelody

If you don't transcribe, do it. If you don't improvise, do it. And so on.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-13 09:04:16 Clockwork_Firefly<br>Counterpoint teaches you a lot about how to balance harmony (or work with countermelody, or anything involving using more than one note at once). You may not always want the same harmonic qualities as Bach wanted, and that’s fine! But the thing that change are the tastes, not the techniques. If you want a baseline that stands out from your melody, you still need to avoid parallel perfect intervals. Dissonances still have more and less satisfying resolutions you can use. Understanding how to balance polyphony is very important, and those guys were the masters of it.

I’d personally gravitate towards Bb6/9(addb13), as Bb+6/9 would be a bit confusing to read, and would most likely yield different results. 

Perhaps you don’t even need to be that specific. If you’re adamant about chord symbols, maybe just Bb6/9 with the Gb coming in as a countermelody, especially since it’s the top voice of this chord. I would think about the purpose of the Gb and why you want it there. If it’s just a chromatic passing note, I would lean even more towards the countermelody approach.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-27 22:11:29 _gh0stwrit3r_<br>I am aware of different perspectives and meanings on this matter. In my humble opinion theory and composing are two different things living in separate worlds. Yes, when both world meet it can be quite thrilling. But they can live apart from each other fine too.

Composing has much to do with creativity and being vulnerable. Most of the time you’ll be your own enemy thinking it isn’t good enough what you wrote. Comparing your music with music from others. Even John Williams - the big film composers - has this pain. Did you know he doesn’t listen to his own music? He said this in an interview recently.

Back on track ... to inspire your creativity just listen to a lot of different music. Start fiddling around on the piano (or other instrument that you play). Start experimenting without bothering what kind of theoretical basis it justifies. Just start playing and discovering.

When you have a (simple) melody, try to evolve it. Play it in different scales, different rhythms, etc. Write a countermelody ... and so on.

And remember, always remember, that you loved the first melody that you had. And that it is worthy. And that it is ok to share it. And that it is ok that other people dislike it. We’re not the same and we do like different stuff. Gladly we do!

Oh yeah, and transcribe music from others! Analyse scores! Those are a treasure too!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-11-20 23:09:12 ChuckDimeCliff<br>As others have said, parallel fifths/octaves ruin the independence of the two voices.

If you want your voices to remain independent (such as a countermelody), then indeed you should avoid parallel fifths/octaves.

If you don’t need the independence (such as a sax soli), then parallel fifths/octaves can be used freely.

Avoiding parallel fifths/octaves should be thought of as a rule for all music, but a means to achieve a certain musical effect. Determine if you want that effect, and then use the means to achieve it.

This is a curious Idea and a fun exercise. Thanks for sharing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-31 12:04:53 65TwinReverbRI<br>Well,

It is "counterpoint" in the broad sense, but generally speaking when you play one "known" melody against another "known" melody you have a Melody and a Countermelody.

By "known" what I mean is something you can identify as an independent melody that could stand on its own - like an A section melody and a B section melody.

It's not uncommon and in some ways it might be the way people first started figuring out Counterpoint and Countermelody - it could have been a happy accident - someone came in at the wrong time or at the wrong spot.

In the ancient days when counterpoint was being developed they used to write in "Part Books" so each singer could not see the other one's part, and they had no way of knowing where the other person was, so there were probably a lot of hiccups that could have caused such things.

However, the odds of the two fitting together well are somewhat slim, unless they are composed very similar to begin with.

But there are even examples of two pretty well known melodies being played together.

You do find in pop songs where one verse is sung during the chorus. Or a more extreme example is "All You Need is Love" The Beatles use part of one of their other songs, "She Loves You" is sung in the background (not sure if the notes are exact). Another similar example is by Yes, in "I've Seen All Good People/Your Move" they actually sing the melody from "All We Are Saying, is Give Peace a Chance" from John Lennon and Yoko Ono (though McCartney is credited as well).

But more commonly Countermelody is just two "recognizable lines" against each other. Listen to the vocal lines here:

https://youtu.be/ap87QgZKTNw?t=242

There are 3 melodies going - 2 heard earlier in the song (with Paul and Linda singing the opposite parts). 

So again, it is Counterpoint, but it's a specific type of Counterpoint, called Countermelody.

Row Row Row your boat is also a specific type of Counterpoint called Imitative Counterpoint and in this case the Imitation is also Strict, meaning the imitating part performs the "delayed" part exactly - just like a delay effect or looper pedal might.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-04-11 05:51:54 SappyB0813<br>It’s a very very good idea to just start listening to orchestral music a lot.  Pieces you like, throughout a wide scope of history.  This is the best way to get the sound in your head.  It’d be doubly useful to know what’s going on in the piece.  What is each section (i.e. the woodwinds, the brass, the strings, the percussion, etc.) contributing to the whole in texture?  In tone/timbre?  This would require some score-reading of course. 

Also, it’s useful to think about which instruments you would like to give the melody.  Which to give a countermelody, or give some accompaniment role, or just to contribute to the atmosphere.  When you listen to orchestral music, try to pick out the foreground, middleground, and background elements.  And try to apply that to your music.

I’m a pianist as well, and arranging/composing for band/orchestra is kinda freeing, knowing I can throw in the stuff that I want but couldn’t play with just ten fingers.  John Powell has a very pianistic approach, often sketching out his film scores by recording each element of the music on piano (in some DAW), layering more and more piano until he gets the full picture. 

Hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-04-11 08:27:45 trane7111<br>To add to this, which I think is correct, I believe that another way to think about this is by trying to write music you might actually need an orchestra for—multiple lines of music at a time. There’s no reason to write for an orchestra if you just have a melody and base line and maybe some chords.

I would recommend as a form of practice that you write something which has multiple independent musical lines/counterpoint—at least 3—or take something you’ve already written, and try mapping it to different instruments in ways that are intuitive to how those individual instruments work. (Include piano in this, but have more lines in those pieces so it’s not just easily divided among the hands—I recommend looking at Bach’s 24 preludes and Fugues for this). Once you have that, move to 2 instruments at a time, then maybe a string, brass, or wind quartet/quintet. Then go for a chamber orchestra (usually 1 of each of the four WW, a smaller string section, maybe a horn and harp thrown in), and then move on to an orchestra once you’re finally ready.

Writing for orchestra shouldn’t be done as a baseline. I started out this way because I thought orchestrally) all I listened to was orchestral music) and I could do a decent job at it, but my teachers all stressed that I write for smaller ensembles, and eventually I saw their reasoning.

1) each instrument and how you handle it becomes way more important the fewer you have.

2) writing for multiple instruments is time-intensive

3) writing for orchestra is expensive—either in hiring players or time spent doing midi programming

4) if you write for full orchestra, it’s very easy to make things sound “good” and “lush” and “epic,” by just blocking things in certain sections, but then you’re not really utilizing the full potential of the orchestra. 

Most important, as stressed above, however, is to listen A LOT—to orchestral music (preferably the masters), string quartet music, solo music, and do lots of score studying. 

A good exercise I was taught was to take a passage of music that you like the sound of, find the score and identify each different musical line/piece. Look for where it’s being doubled or where things are just playing harmony or melody or a countermelody, write it down on staff paper, and then you will have a “key” to that kind of orchestral sound when you want to achieve that music later.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-04-12 00:25:15 65TwinReverbRI<br>Now, end of that phrase/section:

OK, I'm seeing a pattern here - most of the problems I'm seeing have to do with phrase endings and new sections, and the transition between them. Don't worry, you are not alone - this is one of the hardest things people deal with. It's common when people write 1 section, then another section, the try to put them together and "connect" them.

This piece is "sort of" like that, but because it's more like setting the tune in different accompaniments, it's not quite as bad. But I'm going to come back to this in a minute.

24 is what I'm recommending you should have done back in m.8 (or something similar in 15 and 16).

This "leads into" the next idea nicely.

But, I think it starts a measure too early. 23 should still be the "waltz" pattern.

Going up to the F at the end of 24 then jumping down to that low dyad is problematic again - kind of a big jump down to the LH notes again - both sonically and physically.

Now, of course, it leads right up to the G melody note, which is nice.

But maybe your A melody note doesn't have to be a dotted half, and the RH can pick up the last 2, 3, or 4 notes of this rising line and lead into the melody G, and the LH could even then pick up 2 8ths to lead into the accompaniment pattern in that same pitch range (that chromatic idea might work here as well).

That low G in 23 is weird too - again, a big jump out of nowhere to the lowest note we've had yet. So these two measures - your end of phrase transition measures again - could be re-configured.

Now, 25. The mordent. Kind of cool, and ok. A little unexpected. It's the only one in the piece. So a little inconsistent. So what is its reason for being there.

And I think I know. 

The reason I think your section at 64 is problematic is that it is "yet another accompaniment variation".

In fact, I'm going to say I think you may have instinctively used the mordent at 25 because again, you came to this screeching halt in the LH (especially after that rising 8th note pattern and the things before) and your brain was telling you "I need something happening here" and the rolled chords weren't enough.

I think what you have here is what I said above - these are really cool ideas - most of them. But you're trying to use too many of them in one piece.

Or - and I find this sometimes happens to me - maybe it's the right idea, but at the wrong time in the piece.

I think that you've been through 3 different accompaniment ideas which are "settings". Your main character has just been shown at home, at school, and at work after school, with weird edits between the scenes and some sudden freeze frame shots that don't seem to make sense (or at least change the mood).

I would totally totally just use the accompaniment idea at m.9 here at 25.

I mean it actually makes perfect sense - the running 8th notes in 24 could lead into 2 8ths on the down beat - just "continue across the bar" (maybe like where the scene changes in a movie but the dialogue continues past the edit) to get you into the pattern at 9.

You actually do something like this a 32 which works great.

Also, did you notice what you did in 33 onward - you're using the idea from the opening bit in the LH down an 8ve. Ok that's a much more consistent variation - same material, so familiar, but down an octave, so still fresh.

Also something in 28 and 32 - you had moving notes in the LH with the hold in the RH - so see, that's probably instinctive there, but it's kind of the same thing back in m.8 and why 16 might need some help.

Now, 47 and 48 - great! You kept it going through the next section.

I'm trying to think of film analogies - I think it's a "montage" right - where let's say you show your main character in close up and he's happy, then it cuts to him crying, then cuts to him kind of indifferent, and so on - it's like you're going through these moods pretty quickly.

That's kind of what this is like, but it doesn't feel "right" for this kind of piece. The moods aren't all drastically as different as "ecstatic" and "miserable" but if you were shooting that you probably wouldn't film happy, more happy, somewhat happy, maybe a little more happy than more happy but not quite ecstatic" and that's what going through all these various accompaniment ideas seems like.

If you were to change that area around 25 to what happened back in 9, you'd have this kind of nice A-B-C-B-A idea all the way up through 48 and make it really consistent.

If you hadn't gone back to the A idea at 33 I wouldn't have been surprised if it wasn't yet another variation. Had I heard this and not seen the score I would have probably been going, "oh no, I bet another variation is coming".

So I'm glad it didn't, but the following sections do continue to do this.

I LOVE the idea at 25 but I don't think it goes here. Maybe that comes later, or is even a nice coda/ending to the whole piece.

In fact, maybe it belongs at 49.

I'm not at all sold on this "countermelody" idea you have in the high part.

Again, it just is now starting to seem like, "I need to make my piece longer, but this is all the melody I have to work with, so how can I set it in yet another way".

So it's starting to come off as this "self competition" where you've just challenged yourself to come up with as many ways to set the same melody as you can.

Which makes it sound more like an exercise than a coherent piece.

57, eh, it's kind of a cool idea, but you know, I don't know. And 65, oh geez, now you've really gone overboard. 

What it starts sounding like back at 49 is "I need a new variation, but I've run out of ideas, let me try something even more drastic" and by the time you get to 65 it's gotten so far from the mood of the first 3 sections that it's really just a bombastic mess (no offense).

Have you ever seen a movie that starts off really good but something happens midway through and it just is weak from there to the end? It's like their budget got slashed half way through and they just had to edit together whatever B roll they had left and finish the film sometimes.

That's kind of what is happening (or sounds to a listener is happening) here. It sounds like you ran out of ideas and just tried to make ones that don't belong, fit.

Now, I'm not saying the ideas are bad, but it's also like trying to cram every type of shot into a movie that didn't belong. Even though Hitchcock loved all of his interesting shots, not every film has every possible kind of low angle shot in or something (or not even one movie).

My first gut instinct about 65 was simply "take it out".

But you know what, this is like maybe, the Directors Cut, and I'm Sony saying, "nope, you need to edit this down to a run time of 1.5 hours from your 4 hour thing".

But it's not like a great directors cut - it's more like it's got a lot of stuff that needs to be edited out and needs some dissolves, wipes, and cross fades or something - the edit points need work and there's too many different scenes of the same actor in settings that just get stranger and stranger!

That could work for an experimental film or piece of music, but that's not what it seems like you're going for here at all.

I think you're just trying to cram too many things in here.

The first 3 ideas are nice, and the thing at 25 is a nice contrast but doesn't belong there.

I would take these other ideas - the counter melody bit, the LH melody idea, the bombastic idea, and just use them in different pieces.

It's kind of like filming on location, and seeing this awesome rainbow across the desert, and saying "lets get a shot of that for an establishing shot" or something, then putting it in the movie just because you shot it, liked it, and wanted to use it, even though it really didn't fit - that's why you have all these other people who go, "does it really need to be there? Maybe we can save that for another special - on the making of, or another movie" - That's kind of what B Roll is isn't it?

So you're using all your B Roll stuff in here  - it's Expedition Unknown right now - they've gong to like 3 hour episodes that are all B Roll stuff and clips from other episodes. But they cut all that B Roll stuff out of the original hour long episodes because it was really superfluous.

I think that's exactly what you need to do here.

Pick 3, or 4, or at most 5 (the 5th being an intro and/or outro, or contrast section, etc.) settings and use those for the piece.

Don't be afraid to repeat things (the A section idea is the only one that does). I realize the melody is somewhat repetitive but maybe try varying the melody rather than the accompaniment and setting.

For example, you could have your "waltz" pattern again later, but with an embellished version of the melody this time (but not a counter melody added) - so instead of constantly varying the accomp and setting, you'd repeat that with a variation of the melody.

john goes to the park on monday, and john goes to the par on tuesday. The park doesn't change, but john's clothes can. Your main melody is dressed differently - "embellished" if you will, but the setting is the same. Right now you're just putting John into 10 different scenes with not continuity other than John. Probably not what you want for this kind of piece.

I hope that all helps.

As always, YMMV and I'm just some dude on the internet, so feel free to ignore the advice if you want.
