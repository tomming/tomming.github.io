Ex. 
"The performers hit a leatherskin drum with a leather wrapped beater to a three against two pattern, with a oud like instrument playing a mixolydian scale.  The melody has microtonal inflections, as is common in that region. There is a drone played by a bowed string instrument exactly 2 octaves below the melody. The tune is a dance tune, and has a popular dance that goes along with it.

The scale is mixolydian, but the 3rd is slightly raised, to coincide with the harmonic series.  There is no harmonies in this tune, as is normal in the region and style.  The crowd really gets into the dance around the 2nd phrase.  The phrasing is in 4 bars of 4 beats."

Something like that should be fine for an undergraduate world music class; I think they are called ethno-musicalogy classes or something like that now, kind of like how garbage men are now called waste management engineers.

The notes in this progression are comprised of the number iii chord, the number IV chord, and the number ii chord of a(n arbitrary) major key. Of these 3 chords, 2 are minor (in what is called quality), and 1 is major. My guess is that when the song shifts from the minor iii chord, and to the major IV chord, you feel the shift as a (major) hopeful one.
Additionally, these chords are being played across many instruments, for instance, a string section and a bass. This, as well as a slew of recording audio production methods are being employed (reverb, compression, delay etc) to affect your perception.


As for the progression itself, the ii chord and the iii chord are a commonly used pair of chords to hover around for a given composition, and is commonplace in pop, rock, jazz, latin and many other forms of music. A famous example is the song Moondance by Van Morrison.


Once again, it is an all around combination of the things you mentioned. This wikipedia article can get you started learning about how to develop this type of progression: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_scale#Harmonic_properties

Then do the same for the string parts in rock and pop songs that feature strings. The idioms will become apparent quickly.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-04-30 08:19:33 Sazabi00<br>I actually wrote a piece that evolved out of a very simple practice for myself.

After having a year of music theory, I decided to delve into some topics that my class didn't cover. This time around, it was power chords. So I basically wrote straight power chords for a string quintet (36 measures, quarter note = 120, 4/4); and as I listened to it over and over, I began to hear over-laying melodies and underlying beats and harmonies. Of course, I have nowhere near perfect pitch, so I had to experiment a little.

Eventually, what was a simple minute-and-a-half practice thing, transformed into a seven minute piece that I will always recall as being my first piece ever.

So, moral of the story is, learn to experiment a bit. If you have any musical thoughts or ideas suddenly pop into your head, try to write it down as best as you can. Don't worry about the rules at first, and just let your mind run rampant! Once you have figured out your musical idea, add some flourish to it, a hint of creative repetitiveness on the side, and voila! You have the beginning to a piece. At this point is when you should proceed to employ the rules to your piece. Did something sound kinda icky? Check your harmonies. Or maybe your piece didn't seem to end quite right? Check some of those resolutions!

Just remember that those pesky rules serve as a basic template. Yes, there are rules that shouldn't be broken (parallel fifths &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;) but overall, you have the ability to write what you feel is necessary to write. Eventually you'll find the right sound. Just keep trying. Never give up - never surrender! 

P.S. - Sorry to have rambled on forever. I'll provide a concise TL;DR for you.

TL;DR - experiment with writing some musical ideas, then applying the rules to what you wrote.

edit: I accidentally a word.

  Some keys are awful for horns, which is why " in 3 "  as in "Summertime  in 3 " was a phrase used by horn players in the 40's and 50's to describe the key of Eb.
 Pop singers are shopped the same way as studio cats are and certain keys lend themselves  better to certain parts and  certain types of instrumentation.
  It takes a completely different kind of pianist to play in an odd  minor key than it does to rip up a boogoe woogie piano part; each pianist would be happier and the part would sound more natural and facile, in one key vs. another. 
  Bach wrote violin sonatas in G because that's the lowest note the instrument plays and it has open G and D strings. If he wrote it in Ab, he would have to feature other characteristics of the instrument ( and he did), but in G with open G and D strings, there are pedal tones and intervals against open stings that will not occur in other keys.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-08-16 03:06:07 AndrewT81<br>There are a couple pitfalls to worry about here. First off, if you've never studied classical 4 part harmony writing, I would suggest you do that. Obviously you don't need to follow it to a T in pop music, but some of the basics like avoiding parallel 5ths etc. can make the difference between something that sounds amateur and something that sounds professional.

From an orchestration point of view, I would avoid ever having the cello play the tonic of a chord. It's not here as a bass instrument, you want it in it's mid to high register where it really sings. Cello is great for countermelodies, think of it as writing a vocal duet with the cello as the lower voice. 

If you're going to record this with just one player to a part, then I would keep the violin in the lower register so that it pairs well with the cello. Violins in the high register sound amazing when you have a whole section playing together, but with just one player it's going to sound lonely and not nearly as epic as you probably hear it in your head. The lower strings on violin have great personality when played soloistically. Violin and cello in octaves (or even unison if the ranges work out) can be very beautiful and intense, but don't over-use it. Save that for the high point of the piece.

If you need to use the strings harmonically, I would suggest having them focus on the extended chord tones of your harmony (7ths and 9ths etc) instead of 3rds and 5ths. You want to use them to accent their differences from the piano-- strings have infinite sustain, so any dissonances in your harmony can stay poignant and even intensify as the chord rings. If you want a section that feels particularly fragile or vulnerable, tremolo can be extremely effective in pop music.

And as always, make sure that the piano gives room for the strings, especially cello. Strings take up a lot of bandwidth in the frequency band, so if the voice and/or piano are all playing notes in the same range as the strings, it's going to sound muddy. 

Hope this helps, and let me know if you have any further questions, I've done quite a bit of pop string arranging.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-08-18 13:18:35 tubadude86<br>Sure, I would love to help you out. 

As for supporting the bass line, you don't have to double the bass line, but you can write in some lower stuff to add some depth, perhaps harmonizing with the bass line. Not all the time, but it helps to add contrast. When working with pop styles it can be a challenge to avoid becoming repetitious. Changing the register (how high/low they play) can create contrast because string instruments sound different in different registers. Up high they get kind of piercing, the timbre is a little more thin. In lower registers the timbre is more mellow, better for blending.

Effective voice leading just means that you have created harmonies that sound good (not parallel 5ths for example) that are relatively easy to sing/play (for example, it is hard for vocalists to accurately make large leaps, octaves aren't so bad, more than that is hard). Think of it as taking the voices by the hand and leading them safely from beginning to end.

Anyway, feel free to contact me with any questions.

If you're that good at pitch, it's probably because you instinctively enjoy it, so I'd say skip the fixed instruments (piano, drums, vibes/xylo, organ)

If you enjoy singing, then you want something that can be sustained, doesn't decay, so no piano, harp, or guitar.

How much does pop/jazz/rock matter to you vs classical?

Playing with other people vs playing alone?

If you want classical more, head for the string family and pick the range that feels right. If pop, lean toward the brass/winds.

How much time do you feel like spending on physical coordination before hitting entry-level sound? The less you want to spend, the bigger the muscle groups.

Bass and trombone will be useable before cello or flute, and violin and oboe are going to be the least accessible of all.

If I had to pick for you I'd say sax, but really, only you know which instrument feels like your true voice. And even if you don't know yet, you'll recognize it when you try it. Trust yourself.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-08-19 00:42:27 johnmadison<br>Learn everything you can. Don't stop at just one instrument. Unfortunately, you started on an instrument that limits you on other instruments. If you had been a string player, everything with strings and frets should come easily (except for bowing/picking technique).

I say guitar or bass is a good starting off point to learn the rest of the pop instruments. Then move on to drums. If you can play piano, bass, guitar, drums, you shouldn't have a problem getting work. 

If you have the time after that, learn a wind instrument. Clarinet is easy to start and then you can work your way to Saxophone.  Or if you'd rather start on trumpet and work your way to baritone and finally trombone. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-09-19 23:56:43 chefericmusic<br>I would like to suggest that one easy way in to this is to take a song you know really really well, isntead of a jazz tune that you dont know well. If you took a nursery rhyme song or a pop or rock piece and did it as a ballad, you might only need simple majors and minors to work with, but the idea that you play the melody on the top with the chord on the bottom sinks in much faster than trying to play dolphin dance or fly me to the moon or whatever. Christmas Carols and happy birthdsay are really good for this as well, beatles tunes and 50's tunes. So after you have a simple song, then you can start to see that by moving something like a D chord, between the 2nd fret form, the 5th fret form and the 10th fret form ( the 3 basic inversions), that it is possible to play the melody note while you are playing the chord at the same time. The really heavy chord solo stuff tries very hard to keep the classical tenet of always playing the melody note on the G string whenever possible.Try taking something like jingle bells or happy birthday and you can start to see for yourself without an entire chemistry lesson on chord substution and the piece will naturally be more interesting to you. From there, then go to more difficult pieces but try to play pieces that you really know the melody and chords to very well, that way you can start to see the harmony and the positions much sooner.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-10-31 22:25:02 apzimmerman<br>I wouldn't aspire to answer such a complicated question but I will make 2 quick points.

There is a mathematical basis for things that "sound good together".  The most consonant interval, the octave, is created by doubling or halving the frequency of a pitch.  If a string is vibrating at 400 times per second, and then another string is vibrating at 800, they will form an octave.  The second most consonant interval is the fifth, with a ratio of frequency at 2:3, the third most consonant is the fourth at 3:4.  These three intervals form the basis of most music, especially pop music.   The origins of western music are in this mathematics, the rules of renaissance and baroque counterpoint are based on dissonance and consonance.

Second,  what sounds good to us today probably wouldn't have sounded good to people 100 years ago.  It is people stepping outside of the realm of what has been done before, outside of what "sounds good" that creates new and interesting music.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-11-05 09:22:19 hurricane658<br>Knew this was Two Steps From Hell without even following the link. 

This style of movie music is probably the most frequently used today (see Hans Zimmer). I've done a little independent experimentation to figure out how this works. 

Basically it's your typical pop music setup, set in a minor mode without the leading tone. The i-VI (or vi-IV in major) progression is very uplifting, and it is a staple of the four chord song. The melody is simple with a common motive, and the progressions are advanced by adding the leading tone to create the major V in minor.

It's orchestrated heavily with horns, high strings, and choir to invoke a dramatic setting, almost like frightening church music. The increase in intensity is achieved by adding percussion, adding flowing string lines, and getting progressively higher. 

TL;DR it's a combination of simple progressions highlighting the i-VI in minor and dramatic choir/brass-centric orchestration. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-01-15 00:40:44 dms51585<br>The song is in the key of F major. The chord progress in the introduction is:

Dm - F - Bb - F - 
Dm - F - C - C - 
Dm - F - **A** - Dm - 
Bb - **Bbm** - F - F

or:

vi - I - IV - I - 
vi - I - V - V - 
vi - I - **V/vi** - vi - 
IV - **iv** - I - I

The "V/vi" and "iv" (in bold) are probably where you have questions.

The V/vi is called a [secondary dominant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_dominant). In the key of F, the A chord should be minor. However, since Ben moves to a D minor next, the C# in A major acts as a [leading tone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading-tone). There's a much stronger resolution between A major and D minor than from A minor and D minor.

The "iv" is commonly used by many songwriters. It typically happens as a way to bridge the IV and I chords (as it is used here) because it creates a nice chromatic line. In this example, the third in Bb major is D, the third in Bb minor is Db, and the fifth in F major is C. Therefore, when you string those three chords together, you get D to Db to C.

Both of these concepts are worth noting because they happen so very often in pop music. Play around with them in your own songwriting!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-02-04 14:10:05 justinverlanderxxx<br>Sonic Youth are my favorite band and probably my biggest influence in my guitar playing. 

I'm a music major, and it may come as a surprise to you but, a lot of their best songs, I.E. "Teenage Riot," "Kool Thing," "Dirty Boots," "Schizophrenia," etc. aren't very different from your average pop/alternative rock structure. If you're familiar with rock and blues at all you should be able to fit in harmonically and tonally with a band styled after Sonic Youth for the most part (Lee Ranaldo's resume had barely anything to do with punk or no wave prior to him joining Glenn Branca's band, where he met Thurston; he was mostly a hippie guy in Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd cover bands, both groups which work largely in the blues/rock idiom of popular music). Look at Teen Age Riot; it's basically a I - ii progression. The dissonance you hear isn't tonal dissonance - the song lacks almost any non-diatonic notes or harmonies. It comes from the band's style and technique. First, the guitars are super distorted and super loud. They're played really fast and with near reckless abandon (don't let this fool you, though. This is a very rehearsed band and every note on Teenage Riot is intentional and meticulously chosen [as well as the rest of their album *Daydream Nation*], I promise you). Aside from the I ii progression, it should be noted that Thurston Moore (guitar/vox) is singing a very simple, catchy pop melody that mimics most of the time his guitar riff (which is his signature move throughout most of his career), Steve Shelley (drums) is playing a dancy rhythmic pattern that could have been ripped out of a New Order song or any Top 40 New Wave hit of the 80s, Lee Ranaldo (guitar) is playing counterpoint to Thurston's riff, and Kim (bass) is accentuating Steve's drums for the most part. In short, they are playing within the framework of the archetypal rock n' roll group. 

Look what happens at 4:50 though, after the lyric "paint a zero on his hand": they continue with the same riff they've been playing the entire song, but Steve, who has a background in hardcore and metal, plays a blast beat, they get quiet and then loud again, and Kim stops playing notes and just slides up and down on the neck of her bass, someone hits the strings above the nut (or below the saddle, they played a lot of Jazzmasters after all) and it makes a ringing noise. Someone stops playing the riff for a second and instead just mutes the strings and plays a bunch of scratches, some feedback squalls, Thurston bends his strings ever so slightly during the riff, Steve beats the fuck out of his crash cymbal and floor tom, but it never stops being the same pop song and never really ventures into dissonance that, say, you might find in Teenage Jesus and the Jerks or *the Rites of Spring.* 

Of course, Sonic Youth did use capital D Dissonance. Look at "She's in a Bad Mood," the opening track from their second record *Confusion is Sex.* I can't tell you exactly what notes are being played in the opening riff, but it's based around diminished or flat 9ths, I.E. the lowest string is tuned to a D and he's playing an Eb on the G string (again, I don't know the actual notation or chord he's playing.) The timbre of his guitar produces a lot of the dissonance you hear. The tuning is one of Sonic Youth's signature "open" tunings (search and you might be able to find which one they're using on this song, although Thurston and Lee are probably tuned differently) which produces a bright, ringing timbre, as open strings tend to vibrate longer. Jimmy Page, Jeff Buckley, that kid from *August Rush* and other people who play that tapping style guitar use this same technique for the same reasons, as well as composers writing orchestral string music, which is mostly in keys like D, A, G, E, C, etc. because those are the open strings on orchestral stringed instruments. The riff is played continuously throughout the intro, just droning on those open strings with those diminished ninths ringing out. This is the same theory that Stravinsky applied to the famous Eb superimposed over E major from the Rites of Spring: If you play something long enough, no matter how dissonant, the audience will get used to it. Aside from that, the song goes into a basic i VI progression in the bulk of the song that is pretty normal in rock music with Thurston moaning out some lyrics over the band's feedback and whatnot (this band improved a lot with each album, it's incredible.) 

What Sonic Youth did and why they still matter and why they were able to be an experimental punk band that still put out great records 30 years into their career was take conventional pop/rock songwriting and infuse it with a punk spirit and a constant urge to reinvent the way the guitar was played. It's not merely a matter of what they played, but how they played it. A deep analysis of Sonic Youth's harmonic structure might be interesting, but it's still pretty basic stuff, even in their earlier no wave days. So, just play some catchy riffs, amp them up, stop giving a fuck, and practice with your band until it's tight, because what they did *sounds* easy but it sure as hell ain't. Just try and get your band to play that breakdown in in Teenage Riot, and then try and play it right.

Anyways, hope this helps, if you have any questions, please ask because I love Sonic Youth and I want everyone to understand their music on a deeper level, haha.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-03-04 15:47:26 [deleted]<br>Thanks for the thoughtful reply--

1. Totally agree with you in that some music is better analyzed in a relationship than a key; I'd argue that this is true for a surprising amount of pop songs out there.  With a chord progression of ii-IV-I-V, "No Light, No Light" (link in original post) wanders a bit in terms precisely where its tonic is.  The tonic seems to be C in the verses and F in the chorus) and we're tempted to reinterpret the chords as vi-I-V-V/V during the chorus.  The harmonic texture of the song doesn't really change obviously to the ear, though, yet the tonic has moved.  To properly describe what's going on here, I think we need a way to describe the chord progression that emphasizes the relationships between the chords and that reduces the emphasis on the key.

2. I'm not saying that we can't understand rhythms in modern pop--I just think that there's a better way of dealing with it than trying to write out all the noteheads on manuscript paper.  If we can find rhythmic archetypes of rap verses, drum patterns, etc, we can notate and understand rhythms with much greater ease.

3. I would hardly compare string slides and a pedal point with the sorts of sounds synthesizers can make.  To simply categorize digital sound effects into the bin of "non-pitched percussion instruments" is to wipe away a lot of the meaning they generate.  Listen to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites (link in OP) and I challenge you to try and analyze all the sounds that come up (the wub of the dubstep, for example).  Classical music theory just doesn't have the vocabulary to elegantly describe it in enough detail.

**Edited for formatting**
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-03-04 15:54:03 Yeargdribble<br>First, understand that theory is reverse engineered.  Musicians would look at something that a composer before them had done and find the patterns in what they were doing... the internal rules that composer wrote by.  We basically try to emulate that stuff, but most of the people you mentioned built on those rules.  They knew them and knew when to bend or break them.  Sometimes to a very poor reception I might add.

So if you're trying to get in their heads, I just don't think it's going to happen.  Honestly, I feel that we've plateaued on development of tonality, but that's a different story.

Understand that theory was a tool.  It was for them and can be for you.  If you've got music playing in your head, you need the mix of ear training and theory to know what it is and write it down.

You'll need far beyond the very basic theory unless your head music is very simple.  Solfege, in my opinion, is THE way to help with sightsinging which will also help you dictate stuff from your head.  Do whatever it takes to improve your chord recognition, not just the quality of chords out of context, but specifically the way they sound in a progression so that you know what they sound like.  You probably know what V-I sounds like.  What about I-bIII?  V9^(#5)-I^13(#11) ?

Piano is going to be a huge helper here.  It helps you visualize music and plunk it out when your er can't quite do it in your head.  I'd really suggest working on it a lot.

The other thing is going to be orchestration knowledge.  Can you write for strings?  Do you know the limitations of double stops?  Do you know when or why you would tell a string play to play something sul G as opposed to another string?  Do you know how actual instruments sound in given registers?  Their ranges?  Their keys?  If you really want to dictate advanced stuff you hear in your head, you have to make it playable, or at the very least you can make a piano reduction version, make little notes about which instruments you want to play where, and then deal with orchestration issues later.

It's hard to give specific advice without knowing what other experience you have instrumentally.  There's really a mountain of stuff that you need to take an idea from your brain and put it on the page.  I'd get a serious ear trainer.  I personally like Ear Master Pro simply because it's the only thing I've found with really involved jazz progression stuff as well as other progressions.  I honestly feel like that stuff is more important than learning chord qualities or simply intervals out of context.

For learning solfege yourself, I'd recommend the [Ottmans Music for Sightsinging](http://www.amazon.com/Music-Sightsinging-6th-Robert-Ottman/dp/0131896628/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362382814&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=music+for+sight+singing+6th+edition) book.  I'd get 6th edition.  I recently grabbed a copy of the 8th edition and feel like they made it harder to jump right in.  I really like the way 6th starts with sol and do and slowly builds on it to improve your understanding in a nicely progressive and musically contextual way.  There's also lots of crazy ass rhythm stuff in there that could help you.


For orchestration you can start with [this](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Dictionary-Orchestration/dp/0739000217/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362382679&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=orchestration).  It's more of a quick pocket guide, but might get you familiar quickly on the very broad scale with some of this stuff.  Listening to real performers while following a score (check imslp) can help you understand the tone of instruments in different tessituras. 


For working on piano fundamentals, [start here](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Scales-Chords-Arpeggios-Cadences/dp/0739003682/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362382890&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=scales+arpeggios+piano).  It'll help you get around a bit better and make the theory stuff easier.

I honestly don't know what to suggest as a theory text.  I dislike what I used in college (Kostka-Payne Tonal Harmony).  Not a terrible book, but limited.  So much of what I use I learned out of college and out of a theory classroom.  I've glanced over some bad theory texts and as a result of being very theory knowledgeable, it's actually hard now for me to gauge better theory texts based on pacing because they either look too easy or too hard.  A really easy, super slow one for pop musicians is a book called Contemporary Music Theory.  It's not terrible and I've recommended level one to people who literally are just beginning, but it's painfully slow to anyone with background.  On the flip side, if you look at some of Paul Hindemith's old books on theory, you'll cover more in 3 pages than Kostka and Payne cover in half a book.  Those books move way too damned quickly for anyone and are arguably very dated (I'd almost argue that they are a very intensely concentrated and distilled product).

I'll bet someone here could suggest a theory text.  I'd just be careful.  I'm probably biased, but I have a bit of a beef with theory books that spend way too much time on common practice period theory, touch Romanticism, +6s, modulations, and then hit the most legit of 20th century stuff with a heavy dose of serialism.  Seriously, get rounded.  Get an understanding of at least basic jazz theory and how extended tertian harmony works.  With so many styles fused these days, that sort of stuff is very important and I'd argue more important than the immense weight college theory texts put on common practice stuff.  You don't need to worry about parallel 5ths or octaves... seriously, what a waste.

EDIT: Oh.... and despite needing these tools to write stuff down, don't fall into the pitfall of trying to compose with theory.  Just let the theory help you understand what your mind seems to already be composing.  Michael Kamen had a philosophy about the importance of improvisation and I really agree with him.  You should be able to do that some.  Even if it's a simple monophonic line over block chords of I-IV-V, be able to let your ear lead you around a bit.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-03-15 00:38:15 wab7254<br>I am doing that right now with some success.  My best advice is to make yourself available and your services known.  A lot of people have never thought they needed a composer when you can find an angle to convince them that they do.  I have found a lot of songwriters, pop acts, and producers in my city and just introduced myself.  I tell them that I am a composition student, show them my previous work, and explain to them I am trying to build a portfolio of work and to do this I am working very cheaply at the moment and that helps get my foot in the door.  Sure the work can be lame.  I write a lot of cheesy string parts but I can usually grab a bit of cash for a simple thing like that.

Also collaborate as much as possible.  If you have friends involved in music try to find ways you can work together.  

I can go on and on about this so if you are interested.  Also why not bring this question to /r/composer or /r/composertalk.  You are getting downvoted here because it fits better in those subs and we would love to have some more activity on those pages.

If you're interested in timbre delve into the realm of auditory synthesis, it's devoted entirely to creating pleasing(or maybe not) overtones and's really really interesting.

You can't hear overtones in the fundemental(perceived pitch) of a note. Overtones, or rather how they evolve determine the instrument's tone/timbre. If you listen to a distorted guitar, it will have a lot of 3rd order harmonic distortion(every 3rd harmonic is enhanced). String instruments have every harmonic, but wind mainly have odds.


Really, just pop into a synth like absynth or ableton's operator that lets you change the waveform. Or check out this http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/fourier if you just want something simple and educational. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-04-10 21:55:01 UnluckyStudent<br>The idea of a vibrating string is easily visualized and modulated since you have direct access to the string itself. Wind instruments are more '3 dimensional' as a column of air and less intuitive but more closely related to sound propagation in open air. 

One thing that may help you understand how sound propagates in the air and in the instrument is to think of it as sphere of compression and rarefaction expanding and decaying outward from a point. 

Its a bit more complex than that but it suffices. Vibrating a stretched slinky and watching the wave is a nice analogy of a column of air. 

In so far as your question about the reeds and lips; they simply EXCITE the column of air. Like a plectrum on a string (ie. lips) and the string (ie the reed) vibrating to influence the air.

----
Training your ears will take some effort. Try using some software to generate additive pure tones and use some filters to sweep through the overtones and get a handle as to 'where they are'. Also, experiment with phase and frequency beating. Once you can recognize these phenomena under control they will 'pop out' at you in other contexts.

As for the sharp keys: every instrument used in pop music sound brighter in sharp keys than in flat keys. By example, we'll use e-flat and e. By comparison with e-flat, once you are in e, guitar is on an open string key, add is bass, so are orchestral strings (if they are used for pads or other sweetening sounds).

Also, alto/bari saxophone moves from c to c#( which is the open note on the horn, but it's a brighter sounding key in general on saxophone). Trumpet, clarinet and tenor/soprano sax move from f to f#. French horn (probably only used with the strings)goes from b-flat to b; and alto flute from Ab to A. These aren't used as much in modern pop music anymore, but think Earth, Wind, and Fire.

Every instrument named is now in a higher tessitura, and is producing a brighter sound relative to its sound in e-flat. Purely electronic instruments (meaning computer generated) won't have the same effect on their sound - as they don't have the same timbral concerns as physical instruments - But given the fact that everything else sounds brighter (and that in our comparison the vocalist is in a higher key) and I'm sure they will borrow some of that brightness.

If you move another half step higher to f. Well, even though the vocalist is higher - and saxes and trumpets are still in sharp keys - now all the strings (including guitar and bass) are on stopped string keys. Sure you could use a capo on guitar and bass and that may help you out, but then you're changing the instrument. Overall, the brightness from the higher key will be outweighed by the darkening of most(all) the instruments relative to e. At the least, it would break even. 

Most people are either musicians, so they already know all of this information, or they are not and so they just take a musician's word for it so they don't have to wade through all that verbiage. It's usually only young music students who fall in the cracks -who don't already have the information but know enough about musical instruments to understand the explanation. I'm sure there are way more than 10,000 of those in Denmark alone :-)


Edit: adding to the "why select sharp keys?"question. It most likely began because the open stringed keys are easier to play on guitar and bass (assuming standard tuning). But skilled musicians don't take that into account when they're choosing key. Eventually, there became the conscious decision to use sharp keys. There's the tradition aspect (well, we've been playing in these keys so let's keep doing that).

But also, producers want their songs to get your attention when played in the radio. And if your song is in e, following one in e-flat, it pops. That's also why pop music has been getting more compressed and louder; in addition to the compression facilitating radio play in the car, it lets you boost the volume without unwanted distortion. So, to get your attention(money), producers use as many tricks as possible to stand out. But these are all common knowledge tricks in the business. So when you're feeling with dance-pop music (which all sounds incredibly similar anyway) you end up with overlap in these techniques. Hence, a lot of b minor at OP's dance party
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-04-27 03:42:15 Syric<br>Guitar is not necessarily the dominant instrument in pop anymore (if it truly ever was), but in my opinion this tendency started out as a guitar thing way back in the early days of rock-n-roll, for the following reasons:

* Open strings on a guitar are E, A, D, G, B. Because those are open strings, those are also the easiest keys physically to play in.

* The basic chord shapes we learn as beginners (C A G E D) lend themselves to sharp keys. The fact that CAGED are the basic chord shapes is a result of the open strings being what they are.

* String players in general tend to prefer sharp keys because fretting/stopping a string makes the note sharper. So mentally, we think of a D# as "a D, plus a little extra" and just scoot up a position on the same string. This is easy. Whereas flats may end up on a different string entirely, so they can feel like completely unrelated notes. It's easier to process a D# than an Eb. [The reverse applies for wind instruments, where "plus a little extra" means pressing more valves, which makes things flatter]
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-05-16 06:11:32 keakealani<br>I love the idea, but in my opinion/experience, counterpoint in contemporary music isn't significantly different than counterpoint in the common practice, except that harmonic ideas about consonance and dissonance are expanded/relaxed. So, I think basically studying CPP counterpoint is a perfectly valid way to learn to apply counterpoint to more contemporary styles (art music or otherwise - I think it actually also applies equally well to pop styles). 

Besides that, though, I am a big proponent of study through listening as opposed to reading treatises and essays (those are useful, but I don't think they help with composition as much as maybe understanding someone's perspective on the theory behind it). To get you in the right direction, I've found Hindemith to be a great composer to study for counterpoint, as a lot of his music (Ludus Tonalis in particular) really focuses heavily on applying counterpoint with a more contemporary harmonic language. You've already identified Messiaen, and I think he's certainly another composer worth looking at for counterpoint. A third I'd bring up is Bartók, as a lot of his music (string quartets, for example), have an almost Bach-like motion, with a LOT of "wrong" notes. 

Which reminds me of an exercise my composition teacher used to tell me to do - try playing Bach much faster than your piano skills allow (works best for people like me who are terrible at piano), but leaving all your "wrong" notes in - it's actually an interesting way to explore the idea of essentially independent lines, but outside of Bach's idea of a tonal framework. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-05-28 05:27:34 Yeargdribble<br>You're fine.  I'm making it just fine and I still have problems with really common chord progressions sometimes.  It's a funny thing, if you give me larger, jazzier chords, I can identify them much more readily (and I'm a person who got into jazz very late).  They have more meat and defining characteristics.  But if you give me lots of triads, I get lost pretty fast.

The problem I've found is that too many ear training exercises are terrible about some of the stuff you mention.  They are in no context.  Can I sing a perfect fifth?  Sure.  Can I sing most intervals from a given note?  Sure.  However, identifying several notes in a row with lots of non-diatonic tones and no harmonic backdrop can be more difficult.  If there's a weak tonal center, I'm really lost.  

At the same time, chords can deceive my ears in much the same way.  Can I tell major and minor apart?  Yeah.  But start putting things into a string of chords one after the other and you might notice that sometimes major chords sound sort of minory and vice versa.  Depending on voicing and inversion, your ear might pick up on the E and G of a C major chord and you're hearing that minor third strongly.  Or you might pick up on the C an E of an Am chord and hear the major third strongly.  It can throw you off.

While I guess all of the popular ear training tools people throw around are of some use, I feel like they teach parlor tricks more than useful skills.  I guess those parlor tricks are the foundation of further ear training, but at the same time, I think they can get your ear too stuck in a rut of hearing things without context. 

If you're trying to hear or sing melodies, solfege is a much better route in my opinion.  Practice solfeging simple songs in the shower or solfeging scales and arpeggiated chords in various qualities and inversions.  That will help your melodic ear a lot.

Harmonically, I just think you should actually sit down with some crappy pop songs with predictable progressions and practice guessing what the progressions are and checking them at the piano.  You don't have to be an awesome pianist to see if the progression you wrote down is the correct one.

I think this is a much more useful and real-world practical approach to ear training rather than listening to single chords or short snippets completely isolated from real music.  Because all that teaches you to do is identify short chord progressions in isolation played only by one instrument in a very controlled voicing.

Someone posted a 4 chords playlist here a while back which I think is actually a great place to get started on training your ears on very simple progressions.  Then just branch out, know your theory well enough to know common substitutions for certain chord functions (ii for IV for example) or other tricks that you hear a lot but might not know the name of (trione substitutions).

Good luck.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-07-02 07:12:36 Butfuccubis<br>Diatonic modes are scales created by playing the notes from another scale beginning with a note other than the root.  Let's take a look at a C major scale:

C--D--E--F--G--A--B--C

We call this the Ionian mode.  Why?  Because someone decided it "sounded Ionian."  Seriously.  The names of the modes correspond to ancient nations.  Anyway, what if we played the C scale, only this time we started from D?  Our scale would look like this:

D--E--F--G--A--B--C--D

Voila, we've just created our first mode!  This one is called the Dorian mode.  The Dorain mode is a scale comprised of the notes of another scale beginning with the 2nd degree.  An easy way to remember this one is Dorian=duo=2.  The Dorian scale is primarily minor in quality, meaning that the triad formed from the starting note is minor (D-F-A), but let's take a moment and compare it to a natural minor scale.

D Dorian:  D--E--F--G--A--B--C--D

D minor:  D--E--F--G--A--Bb--C--D

Notice anything different?  The Dorian has a B while the natural minor has a Bb.  In other words, in the Dorian scale, the 6th scale degree is a *Major* 6th above the starting note, while the 6th scale degree in the natural minor is a *Minor* 6 above the starting note.  It's these unique tones that make modes fun to work with.  The Major 6th adds a sort of melodic and mysterious flair perfect for cool jazz.  Lay it back and swing it hard, and you'll be the heppest cat in the room, you dig?  Miles Davis's "So What" is primarily in C Dorian (C--D--Eb--F--G--A--Bb--C).  Ain't nothing cooler than that.

By the way, did you catch that we name the modal keys based on their starting note and not the root scale?  Good.  Moving on.

Next up is the Phrygian mode, which begins on the 3rd scale degree.  Based on C major, we get this:

E--F--G--A--B--C--D--E

Once again we have a primarily minor quality scale, only this time our altered note is the 2nd.  Instead of a Major 2nd, or whole-step, between the starting note and the 2nd (F#), we have a Minor 2nd, or half-step (F).  The half-step causes the 2nd to lean heavily back to the first, bringing emphasis to the starting minor triad, in this case E--G--B.  Phrygian is a favorite among heavy metal players.  Basically, whatever note the lowest string is tuned to, play in Phrygian mode beginning with that note and you've got metal.  A good example is "Symphony of Destruction" by Megadeth, which is in E Phrygian.

Lydian starts on the 4th scale degree.  Based on C we have the following:

F--G--A--B--C--D--E--F

Unlike the modes we've encountered thus far, this one is *Major* in quality.  Our starting triad is F--A--C.  However, our altered note this time is the 4th.  Compared to an F major scale (F--G--A--Bb--C--D--E--F), the 4th note in the Lydian scale (B) is a half-step higher.  We call this an Augmented 4th.  This makes the Lydian mode easy to remember as well.  Lydian is based on the 4th, and has an Augmented 4th.  Personally, I've never encountered nor used Lydian mode often, as the Augmented 4th always sounds strange and out of place.  To my ears, it creates a tension that doesn't really resolve back to the starting note.  However, it is effective as a means to add some extra tension when moving between chords.  Michael Jackson uses this to great effect in "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'."

On a side note, we use Augmented and Diminished when referring to sharped or flatted perfect intervals, respectively.  A flatted fifth would thus be a *Diminished 5th* while a sharped 5th would be an *Augmented 5th*.

Anyway, now we come to one of the most popular modes, the Mixolydian mode.  You've heard it before.  Heck, you've probably played it before, even if you didn't realize it.  It starts on the 5th scale degree:

G--A--B--C--D--E--F--G

We're still using C as our base by the way.  Does this look familiar?  No?  Let's pull a few notes out and make a chord.

G--B--D--F--G

Ah yes, the Mixolydian mode is the mode that yields the ubiquitous 7th chord.  Its a major quality mode, and the altered note is obviously the 7th-it is a half-step lower than the seventh of the major scale.  In other words, the seventh note in the Mixolydian mode is a Minor 7th above the starting note, whereas the seventh note of a major scale is a Major 7th above its first note.  Odds are if it's a pop song and it's in a major key, it's using this mode in some way.  Play this mode once and you'll hear it everywhere.

The Aeolian mode is probably the most popular of all, and it's based on the 6th scale degree.

A--B--C--D--E--F--G--A

Hey, we've seen this pattern before.  It's the *natural minor*!  This is the pattern you would get if you played a minor scale according to its key signature with no accidentals.  In classical music, the 7th is often sharped to create a major V^7 chord to lead back to the minor tonic.  That scale is referred to as the *harmonic* minor scale because by sharping the 7th, we have added a harmonic leading tone.  But we're talking about modes.  In pop music, almost all minor songs are going to be in the Aeolian mode.  Every blues guitar solo you've ever heard is in Aeolian or some variation thereof.  Aeolian is how guitarists scale Mount Olympus and sit with the gods.

Lastly, we have the Locrian mode, a mode used so little I had to look up its name while writing this.  One look at it and you'll see why.  Starting from the 7th, we get:

B--C--D--E--F--G--A--B

Here we not only have a Minor 2nd, but also a Diminished 5th.  That 5th is important, because we are now no longer in the realm of major and minor.  We are in the realm of the diminished.  It's not that you can't compose in a diminished context, but it is extremely difficult and the results you get may not be very musical in the traditional sense.  If that's what you're going for though, have at it!  In the cases I have heard *of* the Locrian mode being used, it was in avant-garde classical and jazz.

As a reward for sticking around and reading what was hopefully a helpful explanation of the diatonic modes, here's a handy chart containing the names of the modes, their construction, and sample scales.  And for those of you who scrolled down to the bottom looking for the quick and dirty answer, thanks to the laws of the internet, you get to look at the chart, too, without having to do any work at all!  How cool is that?  You could get a job in finance!

        *note:  Aeolian is also known as the natural minor as no accidentals
          are used in its construction.  This is the typical minor scale in pop 
          music.  However, most minor key classical pieces in a minor key 
          use a minor scale with a raised 7th scale degree called the harmonic 
          minor.  Thus, in the classical sense, the natural minor can be said to 
          have a flatted or Minor 7th as compared to the harmonic minor.

Happy modal-ing!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-07-03 03:18:44 BRNZ42<br>I don't use them that often, but a few uses come to mind:

* Many pop songs (especially contemporary worship) use the sus7 chord as a V chord. It's part of the vocabulary for certain styles of music. It's a way to get the 7th in there without having a tritone. This is sometimes seen as a slash chord. Bb/C is the same as Csus7. So if I was writing or playing a progression in this style, it would be something I would commonly do. 
* You know how guitar players will play an open D chord, and the use their little finger to hammer on the 4th to make Dsus4, or pull off the top string to make Dsus2? We can do that too.

Something like this sounds cool:

      D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
    --11---12---11---9---11--
    -------------------------
    -------------------------
    --10---10---10---10--10--

Being able to move between those suspensions and the natural third gives us some cool options as bass players. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-09-07 00:42:23 tritonesub<br>What I find common amongst metal musicians who are really into progressive and/or technical metal, is that they have a really good ear for notes that sound good together in a given chord, but have a hard time understanding how or why you might want to break away from those notes or chords in a melody or song.

For example, a metal guitarist might come up with a pitch collection like Eb, G, Bb, Db, F, which will sound good together, but some metal musicians might not understand why. Really, it's just a Eb-9 chord, but it often gets viewed as just a pentatonic scale of sorts by metal musicians and all of the riffs in the song will be written around it.

No matter how quickly the patterns are played, or in what octave, or how the pitches are ordered, the whole song is going to sound like one long chord. Which is very boring.

To sum up a long point, this is exactly why it should be very important to understand functional harmony, especially if you are into progressive music. In my mind, progressive music should be able to defy tonality in a creative way, but when you're just utilizing tonal idioms without tonic function, it just sounds like awkward pop music played with distortion in a lower range.

You need to learn the rules before you break them.

Where to start? The most basic rudiments, learning to read and write notes, intervals, chords, etc. http://musictheory.net has good rudiments lessons, as well as exercises.

For learning to read music, get a guitar method book that does not have tabs underneath. If there are tabs, tape over them or something. It is important to learn to read music as a guitarist because otherwise guitarists learn and remember music too much on a visual level (remembering finger shapes/patterns). You should be remembering music by ear, and be able to understand by ear. http://musictheory.net also has ear training exercises.

Regarding tuning, especially in metal, and relating to my previous point, do not rely on using your lowest string as an ostinato bass line, because you will be relying on the same pitch collections way too much.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-09-12 00:52:30 keakealani<br>I don't know about pop music, but this happens all the time in classical genres. Operatic arias often double or duet with the singer for cantabile arias, such as [this recording of "Musetta's Waltz" from *La Bohème*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jakJm-BS48Q), where you can hear the strings and winds doubling or embellishing much of the singer's melodies. In the Baroque tradition, vocalists were often treated as literally part of the ensemble, and it was not uncommon for them to trade duets with other instruments in the ensemble - here is [Pergolesi's *Stabat Mater*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-FKk_J91LU) where you can see the voices trading melodies with the strings in several areas. 

You're right that timbre can be a concern - and also relative dynamic level. Strings and winds tend to be easier to combine with voices just because they tend to have more similar ranges of dynamics and timbre - I've often heard that Western bowed string instruments were deliberately crafted to emulate the human voice, and I would believe it. Brass tends to be too loud to work well with solo voices unless the voice is substantially amplified (or the brass player is playing down the street). Percussive and plucked instruments tend to attack the notes differently than the voice (which is why it's somewhat inexplicable that voices are most often accompanied by piano). Sometimes those timbral variations are necessary and intentional, but they don't lend themselves well to doubling the voice, and it's relatively less common (although not completely unheard of) for there to be substantial doubling with those instruments, in my experience. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-09-24 02:25:12 keakealani<br>I'm not entirely sure what you're asking, so please correct me if I'm mistaken. But it sounds like you are saying that you've come up with a chord progression you like on piano, but when it's played by a pop band type of orchestration, it doesn't sound the same. 

There are probably a number of reasons, but one of the big things to recall is that yes, chords are generally voiced differently on guitar than on piano. It's not just strictly inversions, but the specific pitches you'll hear when a guitar plays a chord will generally not be the same as when a pianist plays the same chord, unless the pianist is thinking very specifically about the guitar's limitations. Think about it - in standard tuning, a guitarist could not play a closed-position E major chord on the lowest E possible, because the next available string, the A string, is already too high to play the G# immediately above the lowest E (written E3, sounding E2). That's a simple explanation, but it definitely does affect the voicing of many chords if they are conceived without concern for the tuning of the guitar and the way it will physically be played - there are simply some combinations of notes that would require inhuman contortion to play, while others sit easily within the hand; the latter is what most guitarists would opt for, especially if the former is not explicitly specified. 

Another concern is timbre. While it's true that both piano and guitar are stringed instruments, they both have very distinct timbres. This is even more true as, from your recording, it sounds like you are talking about electric instruments, which of course have a whole bunch of other timbral qualities added based on what is happening electronically with the amp and other devices. As a result, what you hear at a piano is obviously not going to represent well what is happening at a guitar (or for that matter, a flute or a violin) simply because there are pretty vast timbral differences.

This doesn't mean that you can't brainstorm at the piano or use the piano as a tool for composing, but it does mean that you should take timbre into consideration when you're writing music. There are certain rough guidelines that you can learn as you gain experience with a given instrument - I'm writing for winds and strings right now, so as an example, I've gotten pretty good at imagining what the clarinet might sound like in its mid range when it is paired with a violin - even if they play the exact same notes, they will sound different for a variety of reasons. I think the only way to gain proficiency in that nuance is to just have experience interacting with the instruments in question, which is really just lots of listening. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-10-23 10:24:08 Bitterfish<br>Alright, here's what I hear. The bulk of this progression is in D flat (the beginning and the end are not, depending on how you hear things).

Starting from measure three (the A flat chord) we have (in D flat major):

V V7/vi | vi iim7b5 | I iim7b5 | vi V7/V | I V7/V |

This part of the analysis is very unambiguous and standard. I will note that I haven't marked inversions, and they're important -- the iim7b5 chords have a b6 note in the bass, and the I chords all have 5 in the bass making them actually I64 chords, second inversion. This is important because it makes that V7/V to I work, because it sounds like the I is a suspension moving towards V (although the Beatles and Velvet Underground for two examples both used V7/V-sounding chords in other ways, among others).

So, we got a V moving deceptively to vi through a secondary dominant, and then the rest is made up of some chunky chords that want to go to V (A flat) and never quite make it there, instead acting as neighbors to the tonic.

One thing I will highlight, the motion from Bbm to Ebm7b5 (i.e., vi to iim7b5). This is accomplished with the bass descending by semitone, from scale degree 6 to b6, and I hope you'll agree that the motion is probably the most striking and affecting in this progression. This is a real souped up version of the classic mode-mixing motion from a IV chord to a minor iv chord, and is a real emotional powerhouse.

So, the beginning and the end are open to interpretation. The passage from Cm7b5 to Ab is smooth, because Cm7b5 is viim7b5 in D flat, another form of the dominant. But, there's not really any functional way to explain the motion between Bb7 and Cm7b5 in the context of D flat. Coming in with no context, I think I hear the Bb7 chord at the beginning as just I with a dominant 7 sonority, with the Cm7b5 chord as a minor plagal neighbor chord that acts as a pivot towards D flat.

The motion at the end, from Eb7 to Bb7 is more jarring; its most reminiscent of the IV7 to I7 motion you hear in the blues (and derived pop styles.) Honestly, I think it's a little out of place, and if you want to get back to that Bb7 chord from Eb7, I would come up with a more graceful way to do it, which may take several measures.

edit: a fun way to begin would be resolve the Eb7 deceptively to either E major or f minor, and go from there. I think it is easier to get back from f minor, but more fun from E major -- from there it's exactly one tritone's worth of modulation away.

edit 2: also, I didn't mention but hopefully it's clear that I think this sounds very good overall! I very much like your string (all cello?) orchestration. I think the voicing and everything is very well done.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-10-24 03:21:47 NohbdyHere<br>As said previously, that's an Ab major 7 (AbM7) rooted on the 3rd (C). I sometimes do a similar voicing for bossa novas with my thumb fretting the chord root (Ab on the 6th string). 

The progression you mentioned with the 4th string movement creates a C minor (Cm), which is a popular harmonic progression in pop music and one of my favorite progressions: for example, [Rhiannon by Fleetwood Mac](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDkKyBU7GCs). In this case, a C minor scale fits simply over the pair, as the common C root suggests the minor chord as the harmonic basis.

The third chord you mentioned can be thought of as an F minor 9 (Fm9) with the root on the 5th (C again) but without a third, making it sound out-of-the-ordinary. Again, this fits the Cm - AbM7 movement mentioned above, with some neat Fm voicings thrown in. 

Overall, a good question! The only way to learn how chords work is to learn why they make sense.

Unfortunately for you, that is probably going to mean more violin repertoire than viola repertoire.... But party trick pieces are always good to have up your sleeve! I play cello and people are always so amazed to hear a string arrangement of a pop song. I feel bad as my arrangements are so simple and don't really deserve the kudos but audiences seem to really enjoy it.

 Good luck, I hope you raise  as much as you need to and have an amazing trip.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-12-13 07:08:14 ashowofhands<br>Calling some of the examples ITT "pop music" is a bit of a stretch, IMO.

**Sara Bareilles** is, IMO, the best female singer-songwriter who gets attention from pop stations, and overall she's still definitely among the best.

Notable examples - [Let the Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y10gI-PL5Zo).  Chorus in 11/4 (alternating 5 and 6).  I like the way she changes up the vocal rhythm and melody in the second verse too.    
[Manhattan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05GZ6G2FZLM).  That piano part voicing.  There's obviously a lot of deliberation between it - the harmony, the voice leading, the registration.  And it works brilliantly against the vocal line as well.    
[Love on the Rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXUuHuOJcc).  Cool groove, cool harmonies, cool vocal melody, and great lyrics too (comparing a dysfunctional relationship with alcohol addiction).    
[Once Upon Another Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIXlPxblIpQ).  Title track from her 2012 EP.  What impresses me about this one is the timbre and texture - starting off with a single, unaccompanied voice, building it up during the second half into a cacophony of sounds and vocal harmonies, and then returning to just vocals and a faint open fifth to end.

**Ben Folds** (with whom Sara collaborated on her EP), is another name that belongs here.    
[Bastard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W7w932z0rc) is really cool with its shifting rhythmic accents and time signatures.  Love the instrumental bridge.  And of course, clever lyrics too.    
[Boxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOKhqYMjXj8).  I did a presentation on this song (along with selections from the album *The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner*) in my Analysis of Pop Music class a couple years ago.  The harmonies, chromaticism, progression, are intriguing, as is the use of a waltz rhythm.  The string group (quartet) that begins playing in the second verse also has some incredibly well-written parts.  Folds is a great songwriter *and* a great pianist to boot.    
[Fired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOLDxq7iYok).  Just a well-constructed and well-performed song, top to bottom.  It's not that unusual, but the F-Ab-C progression that shows up perennially hits the spot for me.    
I've never watched The Sing-Off, but I've heard reports that Folds is amazing on it, and has proven himself to be one of the most musically-literate judges on a show of its type.  Thought that was pretty cool, and his musical literacy is readily evident in his own songs.

It may be pushing the envelope a little bit as far as the "pop" definition, but **The Reign of Kindo** is one of my favorite currently active bands, and their chops are unbelievable.  They also put on a great live show too - currently touring with Scale the Summit and a couple other smaller bands.

[Thrill of the Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJWuXfiXYI0) is possibly my favorite song they've ever written.  Everything fits together like a jigsaw puzzle, and from theoretical and technical standpoints it's stunning.  They're all top-notch musicians with impeccable senses of rhythm.  I love the bass line throughout the entire song too.

[Feeling in the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ow-D8X-uM) was the first "single" from their newest album.  Predominantly in quintuple meter, but still rhythmically smooth.  This is due to the "overriding" (a term I picked up from [Gavin Harrison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2ReDqc3aFs) of Porcupine tree) the odd meter.  And the chorus is crazy - almost feels like polyrhythm.

[Just Wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIZRIf1LnSY).  I don't really have many specific details to point out here, it's just a fantastic, and *very* musically-competent song overall.

I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-viio

And then whatever sounds good to you. There is no theory that will tell you what to do to write a pop song. 

If there was, then computer programs would write hit songs, and anyone could write hit pop songs, just by reading a book. 

There are, however, common chord progressions in pop, and those chords in I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-viio have sort of roles they tend to play. 

That's in major key. Minor key is the same pattern except the vi is the tonic, convention renames them so that vi becomes i, and viio, iio etc.. and there are common roles those chords play as well, but really there are so many possibilities, and the theory doesn't really matter, it is what it sounds like that matters. 

In pop music the melody is very key as well. But again, there is no theory for telling you how to write a good melody. It's all about the phrasing, the timing how it works with chords, from a sound perspective. 

Music is relationships. It is relative. Those relationships have sounds, and those are named. But how you string those sounds together is not a science. It is art. 

Learn the key, learn I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-viio, and learn songs you like, and see what they are, so that you can know what those things sound like. 

Then, because you know what they sound like, you can write songs. 

You can write songs even before that, but when you name the sounds, and know where they are, it is faster. 

I-V-vi-IV is a popular one.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-02-13 06:45:54 Edgar_Allan_Rich<br>No. Chord inversions are relative to the staff, not the instrument. 

Think of it like this. I can play an E4 on an oboe while you play a G4 on a saxaphone while our friend plays a C5 on a clarinet. That is a first inversion chord. Think of each string on the guitar the same way.

Of course once you get into different styles of music the thinking is a bit different...generally that thinking is that inversions don't exist at all, in which case you don't need to worry about it! Some think even further outside the box and just rely upon guitar magazine and internet tab to learn music, but I digress...

 In pop, a chords can be dictated in any number of ways and this may vary on different instruments. Jazz is generally dictates by what's happening with the bass and then defines "constraints" upon the notes possible to play in the bar. But that doesn't mean the musicians aren't thinking in inversions. They most certainly are. It's all a matter of practicality, but the idea of inversions never goes away, no matter what style or instrument you are playing. Strict inversion rules, however, are specific to the "classical" "genre".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-03-20 22:20:42 [deleted]<br>Yup, it depends on the type of orchestration you're doing. A standard rock / pop song for example may get muddied or overly complex if imagined in four part harmony. 

Look at Katy Perry's "firework" or P!NK's "Raise your Glass" - both have a very clever counterpoint going between bass and melody (the bass is pulling a lot of first and third inversion) but the accompaniment on piano / synths is mostly mostly just fleshing out the harmony, not really acting as a tenor / alto section. Even in the brief string section the chords are built more as staccato piano accompaniment. I think a pop song with too much counterpoint would be a little awkward for listeners in 2014... although... Hmm! Maybe a project when I fix Pro Tools!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-07-10 00:23:07 Akoustyk<br>You said it yourself. A lot of music with mass appeal does in fact use dissonance. 

The thing is, it's not a dissonance thing. Or a this or that. It's not using tritones or not, or using a V-I or a IV-I cadence. None of that matters. 

It's what the specific song sounds like. The specific timing and use of specific notes. 

You might make the observation that pop songs tend to use notes that are a tone away from chord tones. You might notice that it is a frequent occurrence in pop music. And that is mildly interesting. But that's not unlike observing  a great novel, and noticing it uses the word "the" A lot or something. Ok, that's an extreme example, but the point is, general observations like that, are not useful for *really* making music, imo.

Because none of those things matter. Dissonance or not, it is the specific timing and string of notes, and how they specifically work with the rest of the music. Every instance is specific. 

Whenever you come up with some general sort of guide, then you are completely missing the magic that is music. 

Any generalization you find will have a ton of exceptions. None of the sounds on stand alone mean anything. It's always the whole context. 

Sure, certain sounds sound certain ways, and in some genres you might not use certain things. For some sounds you might not use certain things. But whether or not you should use something always depends on the specific case. 

That's why, to me, it doesn't make any sense to develop things like this. It is more sensible to develop your ability to make whatever sound you imagine be able to come through your instrument. Then everything is taken care. If you feel like hearing a note which creates dissonance, for whatever reason, then you play it. If you don't, then you don't. 

It doesn't make sense to think "I want dissonance" or "I want tension now." or, "release" your mind should just be thinking in sound. And you create the sounds you want. 

To me, that is the purpose of theory. You wrote down a lot of stuff. My brain can't be thinking all of those things when I'm improvising and my timing has to be impeccable. It has to go straight from idea to sound. I can't wonder whether or not I'm a step out of a chord, or whether or not there will be dissonance, or anything like that. 

Whatever trend you discover can always have a number of exceptions.  Because it is always context that matters. Any given note with a certain timing has a certain effect based on the music, and the timing and notes that came before it, and those that will come after. And this is far too complex to be able to describe in any sort of explanation. 

That's why computers can't make good music.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-07-24 05:19:14 GhostofTrundle<br>As the top comment mentions, there are some "arbitrary" factors that have to do with instrumentation and tuning systems. For instance, as a string player, I definitely have experienced some of Bach's inclinations about key and affect. For example, the violin strings are tuned (low to high) to G, D, A, and E. Any key in which those pitches play prominent roles (tonic, dominant, subdominant) will utilize the open strings more and resonate those open strings more, which creates a "warmer" tone and more possibilities for striking multiple notes simultaneously. 

Furthermore, subjectively speaking, it is much easier to play in keys with sharps on a violin than in keys with flats. That's probably because it's just easier to conceptualize "sharping" an open strong (G#, D#, A#, and E#) than "flatting" those strings. Sharping on open string involves placing the index finger; flatting involves placing the pinky finger, the weakest finger, on the next lower string. That leads to some keys being significantly easier to play than others. 

Also, sharp notes are slightly higher in pitch than flat notes. So keys with sharps sound "brighter" than keys with flats. 

Finally, a whole set of psychological associations develops from all of that. So if the majority of pieces in d minor are composed with a certain emotional valence (usually characterized as "somber"), the tendency is to associate that key with that emotional valence. Given subtle, audible effects relating register to the sound quality of particular instruments, those associations tend to stick. 

I would also add that there are some experiments suggesting that music listeners without serious training demonstrate a sort of quasi-perfect pitch phenomenon. Specifically, when lay people sing a pop song that is well-known to them through repeated listening, they will sing it in the right key at more than chance frequency. 

So even though modern instruments and tuning systems would probably negate any of the built up associations between key and affect which were characteristic of the 18th century in particular, there are probably still some real factors that affect perception and performance — all within a particular cultural tradition, of course. At the least, any string player is going to struggle harder to play a piece in d-flat minor relative to A major, for example. And you're going to hear that struggle as a listener, I think. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-10-12 08:29:57 DuckTux<br>Well I have several ideas on this matter, but I don't feel like typing a novel so I'll just talk about what I feel may be the biggest reason: common practice pieces are more difficult to learn and have already been fully established in terms of what is "normal" for that period of time.

If you can learn to understand a string quartet, concerto, or whatever random piece with all sorts of shenanigans like augmented 6 chords, modulation, etc., then I feel like you would have literally no problem analyzing most pop songs. However, the inverse may not necessarily be true. When you learn at a higher level than necessary, you're prepared for all situations.

Similarly, popular music is pretty always pretty much going to be the "brand new thing." And as such, how can we define popular theories when they are still so young in their development? In 100 years electronic music may be taught in schools and held in the same regard as common practice period or jazz is. But as of now, it's difficult to teach something that has barely been explored.

And just as a reminder; these are my opinions, and everyone is free to disagree. For reference, I'm currently an undergrad.

Thing is, there's more to analysis than labeling chords. The way chords function in pop music and the forms of pop music are topics that are not necessarily trivial and that aren't really covered by traditional theory. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-10-29 15:53:37 zegogo<br>I agree with most of the comments about context and audience as to how I use the term "pop", but I haven't come across a comment that addresses the use of "pop" as a broad adjective that can be applied to pretty much anything.  

Here "pop" means accessible and marketable.  Kenny G ain't jazz by most serious definitions but he sure is "pop".  Mozart can be pretty damn "pop" with his flowery overwrought melodies.  Rachmaninov can get very "schmaltzy" and that to me is this idea of "pop".  Miles had moments where he went pop with Someday My Prince Will Come or True Colors.  He could say he loved the melodies all day long, but he also loved the paychecks.  You could say Wes Montgomery went "pop" when he started doing Beatles tunes with a string section, and not because he's doing Beatles tunes, but because it's sooo damned accessible and marketable.  In contrast, Charlie Parker does an album with a string section and you want to call it "pop" 'cause it's with a string section and material is pretty Broadway tunes, but damned if that is not some challenging, very modern, arrangements and some absolutely soulful playing by Bird. Go listen to Bird with strings and tell me that is pop music.

There are plenty of examples of say a heavy metal band going "pop", Metallica did that Enter Sandman shit, which was by all means their first attempt at "pop".  Did the Clash go "pop" with Should I Stay or Should I Go????

 It' s not a genre here, it's not a style that's not jazz or classical, it's an attitude.... how bad do you want to sell records?  bad enough to sing that ridiculous chorus "should I stay or should I go"?  I imagine Joe Strummer was looking for the back door the entire time that song was played.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-11-14 00:10:11 Mattszwyd<br>The question has been pretty much answered, but I think the claim that the Lydian dominant mode is based off the melodic minor scale is misleading (since that scale is the product of chromatic inflection and not generally recognized as source of mode, per se). 

It's a folk scale to begin with, you see it in a fair amount of Bartoks music - most notably String Quartet No. 4, Mov. 4.

It's other name is the overtone series mode - you see it pop up between the 8th and 16th partials of the overtone series (it's the first "scale" that pops up in the series)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-11-27 00:44:22 StillUnbroke<br>Also you pretty much never see a III chord in a major key. iii does pop up sometimes, but it isn't extremely common. In all cases, it probably leads to vi.

**EDIT:** Read my next comment in this particular comment string for a better explanation. I worded this comment poorly.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-11-28 02:29:40 Edward_McCabe<br>After years and years of "sort of" knowing the fretboard and "sort of" knowing scales in various positions and plain out NOT understanding modes, and having entirely ignored arpeggios, I'm trying to come up with a good routine for myself.   Mixing some different approaches, here is what I'm doing.

Goals - Learn the fretboard.  No, really learn it.
           Practice scales / modes in all positions until I don't have to think about them, I can just play them.  Really learn intervals so I don't have to think about them, I can just play what I need.  Same (eventually) for whatever voicing of a triad and later 4+ note chords.

I decided the first note I'm going to learn is A.  Made a Youtube playlist with about an hours worth of A major jam tracks.  Started improvising along with them using just one string at a time (a la Mick Goodrick's _The Advancing Guitarist_ books Unitar idea).  Every time I play the root, I make a point to notice this in my head (I think "A", "A dammit!".  Spend maybe 5 minutes per string or longer if you have more patience than me.

Next I picked a position.  I picked the C shape root pattern (A on 2nd string 10th fret, A on 5th string 12th fret).  Learned the A major scale in this position (already knew it, but now I know it formally).  Improvised to the entire hour of the A Major backing tracks staying in this position.  Allowed to move out of the position but only on 1 string at a time (the Goodrick one string thing again).  Continue to notice every time you play the root note, in either octave.

Added a half hour or so of A lydian to my playlist.  Stayed in the same position.  Easy to learn since it is the same as the A major scale but the 4th is raised.  Improvise along to this.  Notice when you play the root AND when you play the raised 4th.  

Do the same for mixolydian (same as major except lowered 7th), notice when you play the root and the 7th.  Repeat for dorian (lowered 3rd, lowerd 7th), aeolian/minor (lowered 3rd, lowered 6th, lowered 7th), &amp; phrygian (lowered 2nd, lowered 3rd, lowered 6th, lowered 7th).  I skipped locrian.  What has locrian ever done for me?

It ends up being a couple of hours of playlist, altogether.  For the first day or two, I just play these.  Usually randomized so I'm not playing the same mode for huge chunks of time.   

The next few days I continue with this, but I spend time each day playing with intervals on adjacent and non adjacent strings up and down the neck (again, from Mick Goodrick's book).  Improvise along to the A major backing tracks just playing major thirds, 6ths, 4ths, etc).  

Continue improvising to the backing tracks staying in that same position and only leaving it when you're playing with intervals elsewhere on the neck.

I did maybe a half an hour a day this.  Only A.  The first week was pretty boring but I learned a lot.

Week 2.

I did the same thing, except with C.  Picked a different position.  This time I did the "A" shape position (in this case, C on 5th string 3rd fret, C on 3rd string 5th fret).  Made a C based playlist, played on each string, learned my Cs, always noticed when I'm playing a C, also notice when I'm playing an A.

I really wanted to rush through on the one string thing.  Forced myself not to.  

Learning the mode fingerings was much faster this week because I'm much better at thinking about intervals and just remembering what is changing for each particular mode.

Do the interval improvs too.

By day 4 or so I was pretty bored with this.  So now, once I've spent a few days only playing in that position, I can leave the "A" shape position and also improvise in the C shape position (which I learned in week 1) still just using the C Based Playlist.    Once I've done this I can also go back and play through the week 1 A Based playlist and play those using the C position from week 1 and the A position from week 2).

And continue.  I'm on week 3 right now.  Picked the note G and am learning the "D" shape (root on 4th string and 2nd string).  After 2-3 days I can go back to the other playlists and play in those keys but will focus mostly on playing them in the "D" shape position.

I'm also spending time on moving between the positions smoothly and without having to really think about it.

Once I finish all the natural notes (after week 5 I'll have done the shapes from CAGED, then I'll pick whichever shape / position feels right and add learning and playing the arpeggios in the different positions), I'm going to go back to the beginning and start the whole thing over.  This time, instead of learning the notes and intervals I'm going to practice playing with triads, inversions, etc), voice leading, etc (the next chunk of pages in the Goodrick book).

Sounds boring but I'm enjoying it and even only being in week 3 I've noticed dramatic improvement.  I still don't THINK in notes.  I don't have to "think" to identify the note I'm playing but it doesn't just pop into my head, "Oh, I'm playing an A now".    I'm noticing that I'm noticing (ha!) intervals a whole lot more.  When I'm improvising along, I'm starting to know the sounds I want and know the interval that is going to give me that sound.  I'm starting to be able to not just play single note lines but adding harmonies on other strings because _I want that sound_ and not just playing it mindlessly because it is in a pattern I know.

That is what I'm doing right now.  I'm certainly open to suggestions for improvements.

I hope I stick to it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-12-10 13:00:28 Gookaz<br>I couldn't tell you what kind of orchestration those pieces are because orchestration is not my background. I come from rock, pop, and jazz, and I'm an amateur whose studied theory closely for the last five years in and out of class. I could tell you that those pieces sound like string ensembles of some love songs. Perhaps look into arranging for strings.

Apology accepted. Some people are having rough days and when they want to talk about something on the internet and they see unclear posts or a repeated one, they may not be so friendly though the internet. We're all people, but applying some etiquette even on the internet goes a long way.

As for Debussy, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOCucJw7iT8) the first piece that I listened to by him. Happy listening. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-01-04 03:37:43 Djeezus1<br>Alright, I'll give you some food for thought in the meantime. From what I gather (and may be subject to debate), the mariachi group has seen three stages of evolution since the French wanted to know the ensemble's name in the 1800s.

The first stage is Folkloric, usually small groups of string-based players with violins, an harp and various guitars types, with their origins in Michoacan. The skill ceiling is mostly 1 or 2 part singing, fiddler-level violin play, guitar chords and the odd harp solo here and there. Keep in mind that the trumpet use here is anachronistic, since the trumpet was added later on. As example is the old interpretation of La Negra: http://youtu.be/LX_sS8Fzd7Y 

The next stage is Traditional, mostly initiated in Jalisco. It came with a standardization of uniforms and group elements, instrument experimentation with the addition of trumpets and the integration of classical music theory. That came to be with the involvement of Mariachi music within the golden age of cinema in Mexico in the 40s/50s and preceded with the advent of radio. This is the style that most people remember in general and a backbone to any mariachi's repertoire, with legendary people which have yet to be replaced, such as Pedro Infante for singers or Miguel Martinez "el Trompas" for the trumpet. As an example of this is an excerpt from the movie Escuela de Vagabundos: http://youtu.be/F7i3xljYFpg

The latest stage is Modern. As mariachi started to fall in the cultural foreground of Mexico, the musicians started travelling outside of Mexico more often and established themselves further out in America, Europe and Asia. In addition of this expansion, their musical flexibility and the balance within the core elements permits them to be easily inserted into many projects, which often brings them to work with different music genres and even orchestras. As for musicians in this era, we got Vicente Fernandez with a well-aged and very conservative style, Mariachi El Bronx as one of the most progressive approaches and Luis Miguel that uses Pop culture as a middle ground. Examples in order: http://youtu.be/_9-oddWM_9k http://youtu.be/7YpnSbHtHDg http://youtu.be/r4mogF9O9_E

Hope this helps out a bit.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-02-04 06:41:19 hillsonghoods<br>Yes, that's *exactly* where I'm coming from (my fiancee is a musicologist looking at pop music, and Middleton's book is on our bookshelf. And I've recently been in a recording studio situation where a string quartet's inability to get the feel of a song meant that, in the end, we had to re-record some parts to fit in with the string quartet's feel instead). So thanks for expanding on that!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-02-09 14:00:39 Yeargdribble<br>&gt;Do you learn how to improvise?

Only if you go into jazz studies.  Despite the fact that many "classical" pianists were famously amazing improvisers, for some reason almost no schools teach even classical styles of improvisation, much less jazz or pop style improv.

&gt;Do you know how to sight read?

For most programs, you will need to know how to sightreading to even get in.  It's unlikely you will get much focus on sightreading unless you're very bad at it and your primary lesson instructor forces you to spend extra time on it.  You will probably read a good deal of music, so it might improve from that.

&gt;Can you compose for any instrument?

Unless you're a composition major, it's unlikely you'll get much focus on this.  Usually orchestration is one of a handful of elective upper level theory classes you need to take for your degree.  This will barely scratch the surface of what you really need to know to be a very effective composer, but will give you the tools enough to understand where to go digging if you want to know more.

&gt;How many instruments will you end up knowing how to play?

If you're a vocalist, you'll probably have to take piano.  If you're a pianist, you won't have to learn anything else.  If you're a string or wind player getting an ed degree, you'll likely have to take some classes in the basics of other instruments.  The depth varies depending on the program, but regardless, it will be quite shallow.  Some programs may require some people to learn a secondary instrument.

&gt;Do you learn how to use music programs?

I hear this is getting better, but not good enough or fast enough.  Basically, the answer is likely just no.  The focus hasn't moved forward enough to make technology be a required part of most collegiate curricula, much less make give the sort of depth that even normal teachers need.  This is a huge problem in my opinion.

I'll be going to the TI:ME (Technology in Music Education) conference in a few days and on of the workshops is called "I Have a Degree in Music, Not Audio!"  What a sad state of affairs.  Most music teachers are expected to know how to use basic audio equipment and or set up sound systems at the schools, but they learned nothing about it in college unless by their on volition.  Most HS kids who just futz around with guitars as a hobby know more about audio than most degreed musicians.  What a farce.

&gt;Which eras / genres of music do you study?

You'll likely spend 3-4 semesters in various music history classes covering very early music, up through Baroque, Classical, Romantic, etc. usually stopping at early 20th century music.  These are just the history classes.

In music theory, you'll learn about classical... almost full stop.  You'll study things that should've been put into the history class in great depth despite their lack of practical value (I'm looking at you parallel 5ths).  You will actually exhaustively practice writing or doing mathematical style problems in this style.  It's unlikely that you'll spend most of your time actually listening to how these things work... just learning rules of voice leading as if you were writing for a 4-part choir in Bach's time.

You'll just barely touch on a few more even less useful concepts getting up toward Romantic music (hi2u +6 chords).  Finally, you might spend some time looking into the extreme avant garde ideas of the early 20th century.  Serialism, how matrices work, other strange techniques, maybe metric modulation.  This will barely touch on any of these and while it's interesting, it's also very impractical.

This is where it stops.  Most theory classes and history classes pretty much pretend the last 100 years didn't happen.  No jazz, no pop, no anything modern.  They won't talk about he theory of it, the history of it, or anything.

&gt;Most important, overall overarching themes / concepts in musical studies?

The focus for most performers will be on orchestral excerpts or the big pieces of literature for a given instrument.  Ed majors will still hit the big rep for their instrument.  There will be some education classes, but surprisingly few directly focused toward music specifically.  The general scope will be old music.

&gt;Anything else?

Unless you're a pianist, you'll get a great opportunity to play in lots of types of ensembles.  This is can hone musical skills, especially for wind, string, and vocal types in a way that you just can't in any other way.  Your ear will improve vastly just by playing with other very competent musicians and learning the vagaries of very subtle pitch and style things.

But ultimately, most programs just don't offer a very rounded music education.  They offer a very academic one... but very little of it is practical even to the main demographic... future music teachers.  So many things are missing that should be there.

I'm glad I have a degree and I value a lot of the experience, but having become a performer in other styles and basically ending up on the opposite end of the musical spectrum, I have context for just how relatively useless so much of it is.  Most people who only live in that musical academia world don't even realize how limited they are.  For example, band directors who have no idea how modern harmony works in virtually every composition they put in front of their students.  It's a major problem in my opinion.

If none of the above sounds good to you, make sure you go to a school that focuses on commercial music or music business, though they will be significantly more expensive generally.  They are the exception... what I've outlined above seems to be more of the rule for general music programs.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-04-09 11:18:21 Yeargdribble<br>I think that kind of ear-training is borderline useless, which is frustrating because it's the vast majority of what is out there, especially in terms of apps.

That type of thing has you doing it in a vacuum with no context.  You're not hearing intervals as they are related to a tonal center.   You don't get to hear the flavor of individual notes at all.  You're trying to quickly string together some intervals one after the other divorced from a tonality.  You can't think "That was Jaws... followed by Star Wars, followed by NBC followed by the Wedding March" which is how so many people learn to hear individual intervals.  I find that utterly useless. Honestly, you'd get more out of just noodling mindfully over either a simple chord progression or even one chord to begin with.  The nice thing about a simple chord progression is that you'll find yourself *wanting* to go somewhere with your melody that lines up with the chord you know is coming up.  You can hear where you want the melodic line to go and with time, you'll start just nailing the intervals in a real context.

Try just doing some major scale improve soloing over something simple like I-V-vi-IV.  You'll be amazed at how much more quickly listening for flavor of chords and individual scale degrees with become second nature to you.  Start with just a few notes out of the scale and then add more.

Another suggestion I saw, that makes sense, but is almost practically impossible, is to limit yourself to a single key and do as much ear training as you can in that key.  The idea makes a lot of sense since it eliminates any technical difficulties and really lets you just focus on listening for harmonic and melodic content that you can always relate to that single key.  Ultimately, those ideas transpose out to any other keys, but if you're focusing hard on just ear training, working in a single key most of the time will honestly be very beneficial simply because what you're really working on is relationships.  This becomes increasingly beneficial as you add more color notes.  If you're playing over something that really allows for more blues riffs, you can really start to hear where those notes work without analyzing the theory and just hear where you want the notes to go ahead of time.  When you run into those ideas in the wild, they'll probably catch your ear a lot more.  "Oh snap, did you hear that b3?!"

If you have something like iRealPro you can set that stuff up pretty easily.  I'll admit it's damn near impractical to do all of the types of exercises you might want to do in a single key when you're trying to work with real world examples.  But you can set aside a certain amount of ear-training time every day to just improv over the exact same chord progression until you start feeling comfortable with how the notes sound in context, then maybe try a different progression in the same key.

You can also try using some random Spotify play lists of simple things like pop and try to copy their melodies, many of which will be simple and maybe as few as 3 notes.  Try to listen first rather than using your instrument as a pure trial and error machine.  Get an idea of what you think the notes are before playing them, then try to play along and make corrections as necessary.  Obviously you can't really key limit this stuff, but just keep in mind that you're listening for the way notes sound relative to the tonality they are set in.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-04-18 21:09:55 Baseyg<br>A few points that first come to mind

1. Most people singing in musicals are actors first, singers second. This doesnt mean they are bad singers, just that when they all sing in a very straight forward samey way. This is so that the same musical will sound the same when performed by different casts on different nights. It is rare to request a very unique or specific vocal stlye for a musical especially when many songs call for multiple singers at once or a chorus. In contrast many pop and rock singers have a unique voice making them identifiable from just a bar of music. 

2. Most of the instrumentation/orchestration for a musical tends to be big. Most scores for a musical call for a full orchestra for a classical musical or for pop rock musicals, a full band of multiple keyboards/guitars with drums bass and string/horn sections. Outside of musicals, Bands are rarely this fleshed out with most rock bands having 3/4/5 members. 

3. Not nessacarily a bad thing but it is very unlikely that musicals are innovative in their music. Songs are written to tell a story or express an emotion and are often written in pastiche or follow a certain style.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-08-08 04:57:34 shortbusoneohone<br>This is purely speculation, but the fact that all but one of the strings of a guitar are tuned in 4ths has to contribute to some of the movement in fourths in pop music -- the single string not tuned in 4ths is a major 3rd. 

If the root is on the lowest string, the E string, a smooth transition between the I or i and the IV chord could be to move up one string and play a simple triad chord — so, the root movement would be a fourth. It's also probably just part of the natural progression of music. People used to use stacked 4th intervals to imitate the dense movements of the brass sections in big bands. Now, a lot of the same stacked 4th intervals are found in metalcore and heavier genres of music with drop tuned guitars, but borrowed IV chords have always had a heavy influence on pop music, especially in jazz. Contiguous 4ths of major 7th chords are huge in jazz — the roots just move counter-clockwise around the cycle of fifths/circle of fifths.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-09-07 13:47:23 phearsom_fysic<br>Time to crack out my essay from last semester. *rubs hands with anticipation*

So basically, the harmonic series was discovered by Pythagoras (that's right, the math guy) when he walked past a blacksmith and heard that a bit of metal being hit gave more than one tone (so the story goes). He then devised a ratio (he used string lengths) that would get you the same sound just... higher (what we call an octave). This ratio is 2:1; or for every time one string vibrates once, another vibrates twice. The other basic ratios are 3:2, (one string vibrating thrice while the other vibrates twice), giving you a perfect fifth; and 4:3, giving you a perfect fourth. These perfect intervals (except for the octave) are no longer used today however thanks to equal temperament, but they sound absolutely 100% pure.

The first widely used tuning was the Pythagorean tuning, which stacked the 3:2 ratios (ie perfect fifth intervals) on top of each other. If you start with C you get the following.

C - G - D - A - E - B

But, you know what, B sounds close enough to C (what we now call a minor second, but slightly off). So why don't we just make it a C, move all the notes into the same octave, and call it a pentatonic scale. Easy!

C - D - E - G - A - C

But wait, theres more. What if we keep stacking up.

C - G - D - A - E - B - F#(Gb) - C#(Db)

If we stop there and just flatten the last two a little bit. We get the diatonic scale.

C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C

But wait, there's even more! What if we keep going?

C - G - D - A - E - B - F#(Gb) - C#(Db) - G#(Ab) - D#(Eb) - A#(Bb) - F - C

Wow, we just made all the notes. Well, the top C is a little off, but we can just contract it (by 24 cents, called the Pythagorean comma) and it's pretty much perfect. The only problem with Pythagorean tuning is trying to move to different keys on the one instrument. If you change key without retuning your harpsichord, that Pythagorean comma is going to pop up in a different place of every scale. Not fun.

A bunch of other temperaments and tunings were developed over time. Some had huge gaps (called wolf tones) between two of the notes to maintain an octave that sounded disgusting, others compromised their pure fifths in favour of pure thirds, which became the new basis for harmony in the 15th century.

Eventually, Vincenzo Galilei, father of the famous Galileo, came along and said "why don't we just make it super duper easy?". Thus, equal temperament was born. Although, everything was fucked. Fifths were tuned flat, thirds were tuned sharp. Everything just sounded wrong. But hey, it was easy. And we could transpose between keys without having to retune. And it's been used ever since until, today, it sounds like the most normal thing in the world.

**tl;dr:** The pentatonic, diatonic, and chromatic scales were all built by stacking up perfect (like, 3:2 ratio perfect) fifths until we got more or less back to where we started.

And, equal temperament ruined harmony, but made it really easy to play with a bunch of other people.

Since you already have them memorized, it will be easy to observe the notation while playing what you already know. This way, you're connecting a concept you've already internalized with the symbolic representation of it. This is similar to the way children learn to read, they've already developed most of the oral and aural vocabulary of the language, so it's just a matter of learning how these sounds and meanings "look" on paper. 

So focus on letting your eyes connect to what your ears are hearing as you play. Do NOT look at your hands, keep your eyes on the music. In the first stages, it's enough to play a handful of major and minor scales and arpeggios. Eventually you'll want to play through all 12 keys. 

Of course, you'll want to start playing actual bass lines. Start acquiring a collection of bass parts. Classical, Jazz, Rock, R&amp;B, Funk, Pop. Get used to ignoring tablature in favor of the notated line. There's no shortcut to learning to read, it's a complex mental process, but one that's logical and quite possible for a dedicated musician. You have to put in the work.

There's a famous scale system used by many violinists developed by Ivan Galamian. It's unique in that it provides a way to create multiple rhythmic divisions of the scale, i.e. playing in different groups of eighths, triplets, 16ths, and sextuplets. It has a pull-out folio of different rhythmic patterns that you practice against the notated pitches for scales and arpeggios. There's an arrangement for Cello, in the bass clef. Of course, most of the information on fingerings won't be directly applicable, since the tuning and string crossings will be different. Still, it's easily adaptable and it might be extremely useful for reading practice.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-11-10 20:56:00 PlazaOne<br>You've already got some good answers, so I'll just add a few mildly interesting bonus details.

The word *diatonic* means any seven note scale made up of five intervals of a *tone* plus two intervals of a *semitone* where those semitone intervals are farthest apart from each other. Here's a [nice picture](http://www.fretzone.com/major-scale-and-its-modes/4581272278) showing this relationship for all seven modes of the major scale, plus links to many other scales.

These modes that we use in music today are NOT the same as the modes that were used in medieval music. Although they are generally a good enough approximation, they include a few modes that weren't around back then.

For the past couple of hundred years or so in western music we've used a tuning system called [*equal temperament*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament), which is pretty handy for guitar builders (luthiers) as it lets them space the frets along the neck in the familiar pattern. However, using ET means that some of the pitches aren't *properly* in tune. Our ears are so used to this that our brains conveniently filter the discrepancies. The earlier Pythagorean tuning system makes use of the [harmonic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music)), which would require shifting all the frets around and forcing you to play in just one key before having to re-set them all again for the next song. For example, instead of playing a major third that was four frets above its root (4 frets = 400/1200), you'd need to have the fret located 386 cents above the root. This is just one reason some players like to use altered tunings - such as many slide players using open-E will just slightly flatten their G# string to get it ringing out with a true major third.

It's pretty good that you sussed out on your own that those two scales used the same fingerings. Part of the graft of learning to play is about getting your hands to become familiar with repeating things over and over, but in different contexts so you stay interested.

Lots of pop, rock, funk and soul tunes would be diatonic, so for a progression that's

&gt;|| Cm, Fm, Cm, Gm ||

you'd play C natural minor over all the chords. But just by switching around so you'll play C natural minor over the Cm chords, then F natural minor over the Fm chord, and G natural minor over the Gm chord, you've gotten yourself into playing a minor blues, which is kind of the gateway into playing jazz. Same approach with the mixolydian over major triads for normal blues.

Hopefully your teacher is going to get you eventually playing those scales starting from all seven notes of the major scale, so that you'll be equally comfortable all over the neck whether going up or down. Some players get *stuck* in one or two positions, which can become frustrating for them and their listeners - but to get good you do have to put the hours in, so I hope you don't mind missing a few parties!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-11-22 13:02:29 [deleted]<br>Okay, it's a historical thing. On the other hand wouldn't scale based perspective be useful in conjunction with tonality, to give additional insight into things like instances of static harmony, perhaps? Isn't the term mode mixture out of place if a lax meaning of mode is to be avoided elsewhere? They call Pluto a dwarf planet now, maybe everyone's happy if we just similarly append the word "historical" or "modern" for clarity when the need arises? 
 
The example was to be a "neverending" vamp-to-fadeout, hypothetically already hypermetrically analyzed to ascertain there isn't a lone pick-up bar or some such. I-V-I-V, I understand to be a way a static harmony may look, which I read is named as such because it *doesn't* functionally progress. A string of true cadential gestures sounds a lot different than a casual vamp, but I may just as well be misinformed and not very in tune with my senses on top of it. If that idea is greenlighted though, I-V-I-IV is also a static pattern, and altering it with a minor substitution gives the I-V-vi-IV pop magic. Are all the four-chord offender songs not tonal by lacking functional harmony? Would reordering the chords just a tad make it represent a functional harmony even if lacking cadential intensity to the voice leading?

[Alright, I tried that out a little.](https://clyp.it/jrnaaozn) Is the reliance on ambiguous/non-tertian chords the point?

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-12-28 05:10:38 noturtles<br>That site is the equivalent of music horoscopes. Although the key of a piece is correlated with the mood of a piece, it's definitely not as specific as that site would suggest and I would argue that it is in fact the mood/style of the piece that determines the key, not the other way around.

For example, a lot of rock songs are in either the key of A or E major or minor. This is because these keys are easy to work with on a guitar. So one might grow to associate these keys (especially certain chord progressions within them) with the style of a specific pop artist. But this association rises more from practicality than any innate quality of the key.

Another concept I think you'll find interesting is how composers can use keys to suggest a style of playing, and thereby influence the mood. My favorite example is using a key with a lot of accidentals to keep string players from using open strings, making a wider use of vibrato and creating an overall more beautiful sound.

Another thing to keep in mind is that certain keys, especially on the piano, often seem to naturally suggest the use of certain chords or melodic phrases. This might only be the case for me, but if I'm improvising in the key of c minor, the shape of the scale makes me use the relative notes differently than I would if I were playing in a minor. To give a concrete example, my melodies use G-Ab-G (5-6-5) more often in c minor than they use E-F-E (also 5-6-5) in a minor. This is because the physical distance between Ab and G on the keyboard is closer than Ab and Bb, so if I go from the G to Ab, I'm more likely to return to G than carry on to Bb. In contrast, the physical distance from E to F is the same as the physical distance from F to G, so if I go from E to F, I am just as likely to return to E as I am to carry on to G. Let me know if it would be helpful for me to upload a video explaining this. It's a bit hard to explain through text.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-19 14:14:14 xiipaoc<br>Lots of pop-sounding progressions and bad voice leading, mostly (which isn't necessarily bad in this genre).  Other than that, it's straight-up tonal harmony.  Totally standard.

&gt; It sounds almost pirate-y

That's because Hans Zimmer only knows how to write one thing and he wrote it in, among other works, the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtracks.  It sounds almost exactly like Gladiator, too.  Bombastic shit with lots of b7 - 1 and Pachelbel-type progressions (like your i - bVI - bIII - bVII).  The guy's got a formula!  So now, since you know the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtracks, you associate anything similar with pirates.

&gt; so far I have a minor scale (perhaps harmonic? I'm not good at spotting the difference)

There's no difference.  Harmonic minor is part of minor.  See measure 13 where there's a V chord?  That bit is called harmonic minor.  It's totally standard.  There are melodies that are specifically in natural minor or harmonic minor (or melodic minor), but "minor" generally uses all of them at the same time.

&gt; How do composers come up with this stuff?

They don't.  They listen to someone else and copy their chord progression, at least in this case.  Actually, while that's meant to be a little disparaging, that's literally what people do, just not in such an obvious way as it sounds!  I've listened to a lot of music, so I know what chord progressions make sense.  When I compose, I use this knowledge to string together chords as I'm writing a melody.  I know what sounds good -- I - V is one of those things, and modulating to the relative major is another.  I know music in minor, and I know that one option is to use the bVII and bIII chords, and that those chords go well with the bVI as a bridge -- bVII and bIII are related closely to each other, but not so much to i.  bVI is related to i and to the bVII and bIII system (the relative major).  All this comes from years of listening to music in minor -- it's not really so difficult once you get it in your head.

&gt; Is this a pretty standard melody/chord progression in a minor?

C minor.  Yes.  Standard, if very pop-y.  The thing that makes it pop-y is the retrogressions -- normally things go *down* a fifth (or up a fourth), but here, bIII - bVII goes *up* a fifth (or down a fourth), which is the other way.  Pop likes this kind of thing a lot.

&gt; I was always under the impression that minor felt very sad

That's 100% pure refined pasteurized USDA grade-AAA Glatt kosher protected-origin distilled oak-cask-aged hickory-smoked bullshit served à la mode with a cherry on top.  Go find whoever told you this and punch that person in the nostril.  Minor does not sound sad.

The same goes for our string arrangements.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-21 02:54:26 SuperheroChuck<br>It depends on what kind of music you're writing. If you're writing pop or rock music, adhering strictly to 4-part writing will get in your way, and unnecessarily so, since the style and your listeners don't really demand it.

If you're writing a piece for string quartet or tutti orchestra, then yeah, 4-part writing rules are going to be pretty important, again because of the style and your listeners' expectations. But in that case, it's important to remember that the rules you were taught as "4-part writing" are actually a way to teach you basic counterpoint, and if you want to effectively apply those principles to your music, you should really pick up a good counterpoint textbook or take a class. (For textbooks, I recommend "Counterpoint in Composition" by Salzer and Schacter.)

If you do decide to go ahead and study counterpoint (and really, you should--it's amazingly helpful), that'll be much more helpful to you in determining where and when to apply those principles to your music depending on what you want the music to do.

Example: let's say you have a four-part rock band: drums, lead guitar, rhythm guitar, and bass. It would be counterproductive to treat the rhythm guitar as its own "voice," since its function isn't melodic. Also, the strict prohibition against parallel 5ths in "4-part writing" wouldn't help you here either, because parallel 5ths are all over rock music, especially if you're using power chords. However, if you knew counterpoint, it would be *very* worth your while in this hypothetical situation to think of the lead guitar and the bass as two independent voices and to pay attention to how they interact with each other throughout the song, aiming for a smooth, melodic bass line that might even lead you to some inventive new harmonies. That could "level up" your song from a bog-standard three-chord number with a thumping I-IV-V bass to something a little more technically elegant that still sounds like rock. And honestly, that's the kind of thing a lot of really good rock musicians do anyway, even if they lack formal training and aren't consciously thinking of it as "following the rules."

TL;DR forget about the 4-part writing you learned in Harmony 101 and study counterpoint. It's more universally applicable and, IMHO, makes everything better.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-27 12:36:08 derFunkatron<br>~~This couldn't be more incorrect.~~ [**EDIT:** *I spent some time thinking about this last night - I'll address the issues later in the post*] 

[*This is correct*] Concert pitch should be thought of as actual pitch. Transposing instruments play relative pitches. For example, when a clarinet plays a C as written, the sound that actually is heard is a Bb. When an alto saxophone plays a C, the pitch is actually an Eb. 

The guitar is a transposing instrument too, but at an octave. This means that it is still a C instrument and the sounding pitch has the same name as the written pitch, but is an octave lower than written. 

[*This should be ignored as I basically described what transposing instruments do and then argued that it wasn't transposing...*] ~~The reason why your analogy is bad is because using a capo on the guitar changes the key that you are in and the pitches written are the same as the pitches heard. For example, play a full barre on the third fret, i.e., G major. Place a capo on the third fret and play an "E major" chord. The resulting sound is the same. You are not playing in "E major" at the third fret, you are playing in G and using a capo to change how your guitar can be played. Even using scordatura to change the pitches of different strings, e.g. 6th = D or 3rd = F# doesn't change the fact that the instrument is still a C instrument transposing at the octave. However, if you changed the pitch of a string in the guitar, say 6th = D, the third fret, sixth string wouldn't be a 'G' that sounds like an 'F', it would simply be an 'F' and that is how it would be notated. This is why the capo example is bad.~~

**Here is the real reason why the capo analogy is bad** - and I took the time to think about what I wrote, what /u/genteelblackhole and /u/Fairhur commented, and what /u/ikirudennis said in the post I commented to. As **Fairhur** pointed out, capo usage, when notated, will show the guitar part in relative pitch. This doesn't just occur in tablature, pop songs, or amateur guitar music; I found an example in  *Lute Songs of John Dowland* (XVII. Come again)^1 that, embarrassingly enough, I've performed, which has the guitar capo III, putting the guitar in E with the voice in G. At concert pitch, the guitar begins with a G major chord, but it is notated as E major. In this instance, with the use of a capo, the guitar is functioning as a transposing instrument, *twice*; once at the octave (see: just being a guitar) and second by using a capo. 

So here is why I *now* think that the capo analogy is bad: it's not an analogy, it is an actual example of what transposing instruments like saxophones do all the time. If OP understands how **ikirudennis** described transposing instruments in the comment that I responded to, then OP is on the way to understanding exactly how transposing instruments work. No analogy necessary. 

I pulled out my piece and tried to drop some knowledge, but I was fundamentally and completely incorrect. This wasn't a semantic argument, a difference of musical idioms, or an issue of formal versus informal notation styles; I made a mistake pure and simple.

Carry on.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-29 10:06:34 nmitchell076<br>&gt;Forgive me, but I think I'm lost as to how you made that connection.

Because the connection is based on links and similarities to other things that belong to the "pop music" and "art music" categories. Some of which I will talk about below. 

You confuse the distinction between art and pop with the distinction between good and bad or between complex and simple. It is true that some authors use the distinctions in precisely this way (*cough* Adorno *cough*). But it doesn't necessarily have to be used in that way. 

You mentioned that Gershwin, Beethoven, and Debussy are completely different. But that isn't really true. In fact, the things that tie them together are precisely what is meant by art music when used as the antonym of pop music. 

So what are the features of the category, what does link those composers together? I'd say when a good number of the following features are present, we intuitively categorize it as "art music. 

1.) there is a hard distinction posed between a work and a performance of that work. Thus we have different performances of the same work in art music, while we have "covers" in pop music land. Likewise, part of the judgment of a good performance in art music land consists of how close to "the work" the performer is able to get, while much of what makes a good cover involves the degree to which pop artist creatively transforms and reimagines the original (in rap and hip hop, this is taken a step further since covers are rare while "sampling" is extraordinarily common). 

2.) The work is usually fixed in a score format upon composition. These scores are themselves published, sold, distributed, consumed, and archived. Pop music, on the other hand, is basically entirely consumed through recorded tracks and live performances. In the majority of cases, a permanent "score" is never produced. 

3.) Art music has certain characteristic performing ensembles, like the orchestra, the piano solo, the string quartet. Pop music has its own characteristic ensembles, like the swing band, the 4-piece rock group, etc. 

4) There are certain genres and forms characteristic to classical music. These include variation forms, sonatas, rondos, etc. 

5) If there is text, it is usually authored by a person other than the person who authored the music. 

6) composers of Art music have "studied" music with some degree of formality. Especially counterpoint or orchestration, or atonal composition if they were born after 1900. 

7) composers tend to be white, male, often from Europe, and generally well off (upper middle class to high class).  

8) audiences tend to likewise be white, older, and well off. 

9) Art music tends to encourage deeply personal responses made in relative solitude and silence. Concert atmosphere tends to see audience noise during the performance as rude and unacceptable. Pop music, on the other hand, often encourages shared experiences with a group of people - including singing along with the singer, getting up and dancing, moshing, etc. 

Beethoven ticks all of these categories and can therefore be taken as a paradigmatic case. Debussy also ticks all of them. Someone like Wagner would tick all of them except 1, #5. But he fits so many of them that we have no trouble saying he's part of the category. The category thus is not defined by a single feature, but by a cluster of related features. 

Gershwin fits a fair number of them, with only the European bit of number 7 being not applicable to *any* of his works. Other categories fit some works but not others. He can thus be understood as a fringe case, someone who doesn't sit comfortably in either the pop music or the art music category, but partakes a little of both.

But Kendrick fits none of the categories. His audience is different, his training is different, his music is created, sold, and consumed differently, the people the people we (and he) would understand as his influences are different. 

So you see, the category works because the similarities and differences it describes are real and tangible. It is a useful category by which we can make sense of the diverse world of Art (and yes, pop music is still art. Because art music isn't the same thing as music that is art). 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-03-31 01:41:14 TRexRoboParty<br>Yep, exactly! Look at larger arrangements of pop songs. For example singer songwriters who later get a band or string section. Most of the interest comes from the arrangement: the interplay between the different parts. The chords are often very simple and started out as common chord shapes strummed on a guitar.

The lead melody and bass line are good places to start. Starting with a good bass part and adding a complementary melody works great (look at all the classic funk for example). Starting with a strong melody and adding a bass line works just as well, though the outcome is often different I find (i.e simpler bass parts, more emphasis on the melody). 

I reckon you can still take harmonic liberties, but the thing to watch is there is always space in the arrangement for the singer. No part can be too busy. A good trick here might be to try and avoid unison between parts too often. For example: the keyboard plays a little motif (maybe a two or three note melody) then shuts up whilst the bass plays one note, guitar plays one small chord voicing then the snare hits.
Each part individually is only playing very minimally, but the arrangement is "moving" and breathing rather than just block chords. The vocal line then becomes the only part to be always present, and can flow on top and within the spaces.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-04-09 06:11:45 ljse7m<br>&gt;I've worked with many drummers in my life in addition to playing myself. I've never met one that tuned to definite pitches to match a song.

Julio Inglesia, the father, I don't know about the son. In the mid 70s I wish I knew his name. He had an unorthodox grip and a set with roto toms. He appeared laughable until he started to play and then he turned out to be one of the best drummers I have played with as a percussionist. 

&gt;I've worked with many drummers in my life in addition to playing myself. I've never met one that tuned to definite pitches to match a song.

Jose Feliciano, at the Blue Room in New Orleans, They did not use the full band and was self contained. He played in only a few keys and he had his drummer tune the drums to Bmaj basic overtone series of the lower end. They were double heads so they were tuned in intervals. IT worked beautifully. Maybe you will find a recording from the mid 70s and you can hear it for yourself. 

&gt;but again, not the same thing. I've never met a drummer that completely retuned in between each song

I think you are confusing me with someone that said that in the context of a recording session. I don't recall making that exclusive claim. Its impractical to do that unless you are referring to Julio's drummer mentioned above. On roto toms, yes that happened. Both with him and a couple of local drummers I knew at that time. 

&gt;Pedal tones are great. Bach didn't use them all the time or even close to it

And if you reread you will see that I was refering to your II V I comment and you lack of remembering the pedal point and that if you thought that the pedal point was conflicting in a pitched bass drum was conflicting, for that to be true the same would have to be true for Bach and his pedal points.

&gt;A pedal point over the dominant? Awesome! A pedal point over every bit of every song? not so great

Not so great if you used a timpani for the pedal point, but the comment was in the context of the kick drum and to save the labor of quoting, the interval of the kick base is the combined tone of the heads forming a 5th. It is a very common ratio to get the true sound out of a drum. And I mentioned they were detuned and muffled to make the tonality even more subtle. You seem to have missed the subtle comments and the explanation of why they don't conflict with the melody and chordal structure.. 

I also, which I think you didn't notice was the reference to the over all tonality implied by the melody and harmony even with the absence of the drums OR a pedal tone. I assume since you refered to II V I that you had studied theory. 

In tonal music, the chords and melody of a selection sets up an aura of tonality. The unifying relationships of the harmony and melody create a "feeling" of a tonal center. It does not stick out and hit you over the head but it is a unifying concept of the four movements of a symphony and the reason that composers choose carefully the keys of the movements in their larger compositions. In shorter pop music the same is true except they normally are in one overall key,

The subtle tuning of the bass drum is similar in that it does not hit you over with a baseball bat, it simply subliminally creates the same sort of unity. Is it universal in use? That would be really sometthing if it did, but no, it is not. Is it used, well, I seem to have read at least one or two posts by engineers I think in this or a related thread that pointed out that they used this concept when they could in their production. Weather used a lot or not, it, like the pedal point of Bach, et al, is a consideration if you care to and understand how to add that element to the music, yes even in pop. And they also use other electronic versions of this from time to time as they filter out  some things and enhance other things. 

The rest of your post is rather just closing with a focus on your music and a claim that I am jumping in and talking about tuning a piano as being off topic. Well tuning a piano would be off topic but responding to the similiarity of the attack stretching the tone producing element of the head and the piano string is not. It was brought up by another poster and was on that topic an perfectly in context as are my comments about the Kick drum tuning as if you remember, the thread is about why doesn't tuned drums interfere with the tonality. I fail to see how a discussion about how tuning the bass drum to conform with the tonality is off topic. 

So to recap. You did not experience the  drummers that I did as a percussionist. Sorry you missed out on that. I was fortunate to play with over a hundred top notch touring drummers with big name stars from all genres of music that toured during the late 60s the 70s and the 80s It was a great experience. I wish more drummers would have that experience. BUT all I can do is expose you to the concepts. I can't provide you with those gigs, they really don't have those types of gigs anymore. Its a shame. AND I can't really do anything except to point out when you switch contexts of what is being said. I was also fortunate to have fallen into a rather unique and extremely intense music school at a time when they were still in their heyday and between the Critical thinking skills used there and further study with people in the Gardner Multiple Intelligence chain of how people think and learn as well as a varied set of experiences of teaching around the world that put me living in areas that had a lot of local ethnic music of Africa, India, South America and China as well as visiting places close to the areas and in the interim, again being fortunate to be in what appears to be an extremely intense and through place that further expanded on music concepts through Kodaly that I don't have to make things up. I tell you about drummers I have played with because I DID play with them. I know about context because I was forced to deal with it when I was younger because I was in the environment where context was sacred when talking about theory. Its not that your experiences are wrong or that I doubt that they are true, its that they have not been as varied as mine. I was a part of all that I stated! I lived it. Just because you did not does not make what I learned untrue. If I expand on a topic, it is not going out of context, it is to share some of the experiences that I had that most younger students have not yet experienced BUT I can assure you that they are real and they have been used. You can Believe it or NOT, I am not in the habit of making things up. I have been a fanatic for a long time and have been very busy doing it. If you don't understand what I am saying. Ask. I will clarify. If you don't want to ask it in public, ask in the private email. I don't like to have to rebut things to people that don't understand but I do it because I realize that I have been fortunate in my life to be in some very interesting situations of a very varied array of musical contexts. I share them with whoever will listen. If you don't like it or do not want to understand what I am saying, fine. No one is going to make you be interested, but they will always be based upon real things that have happened or defined speculations of things based upon the process of investigating subjects to the extent of analyzing things by techniques of Critical Thinking. SO if you don't understand just ask. I will explain but if you don't understand what I say, that doean't mean it is not true so if you don't want to be lectured, make sure you understand that there may be more to the topic than you understand and if you ask I will explain it to you. IF you still don't understand my post to you, ask, I will explain it again if you really want to learn how it is true and why it works. 

Believe it or not, I think you have some good ideas there, but you need to learn how to take information for what it is and realize that there are more to things than you may have experienced so far. I encourage questions, I don't particularly like to be accused by out of context logic of things that are not at all what was meant if you take the time to understand what was actually stated and the context it was stated in. Try it, You might find that some of the things that you already know have implications beyond what you presently think they are limited to! If that's fuzzy, if you you learn how to apply what you have experienced to include the implications of what you have learned, you will find that you know more than you think if you take the time to learn how to think about it!!

He recorded the first Foo Fighters album on his own, so he's certainly capable of it.  You keep saying advisors like he's a politician.  Obviously creating an album is a collaborative work, but my point is that final say on the collaborators is up to the band.  It's like you're saying that there's nothing unique about Quentin Tarantino's work, because he has gaffers and sound techs and assistant directors work on his movies.

&gt; Also, the studios aren't going to sponsor a record by Dave Grohl and invest millions of dollars behind an artist without some sort of oversight

Again, this might accurately describe an album by a new pop star.  It bears no resemblance to how things work for a major band.  Total artistic control is a common clause in contracts for bands with the clout to demand it, and Foo Fighters are definitely a band that can demand it.

&gt; If you think modern rock bands do not work with composers or arrangers, then you are sorely mistaken.

I didn't say that, I said it was rare.  If a song includes string or horn parts, it's probably arranged by an outside arranger (hired by the band) - but most rock songs don't.  As for outside *composers*?  No, it's very rare. The band writes the songs.

&gt; In the last 2 months I have recorded with a reggae band, salsa band, blues band, jazz combo, and recorded a sound track for a musical.

When you work for hire, it leaves with the impression that's what studio work is.  But what's true for you isn't true for the Foo Fighters.

&gt; This isn't the 80's or even the 90's anymore.

And yet that's how you're describing the recording industry.  I can practically see the cigar puffing suit demanding the band work with this or that arranger.

&gt; Your comments make it seem like you know about music but have spent very little time in recording studios. 

I haven't spent a lot of time in recording studios, that's true.  I recorded 1 album, at a pretty breakneck pace.  But at every step of the way, I (and my bandmates) were the ones making the decisions.  The producer worked for us, not the other way around.  Being a studio musician is different from being in a band, and you don't seem to understand the difference.

Often when I compose a pop song, I only write down the vocal and the piano part. But to fully see the structure, or for demonstration purposes I might add guitar chords, a lame string ensemble voice, a rudimentary bass line or whatever. Perhaps OP used the cello in his piece somehow similar.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-05-04 21:36:47 SuperheroChuck<br>The actual reason is that A# and Bb are two different pitches. We made them the same pitch on the piano as a matter of convenience.

Here's the thing: because of the way sound waves work, when you tune something perfectly in one key, it sounds progressively more out of tune the further away from that key you go. For example, if you tuned a piano perfectly in C Major, anything written in C would sound great on it, but if you wanted to play something in G or in Ab, it would sound gross. There's physics and math that can explain why this is so, but just take my word for it at the moment.

The thing is, when you look at that piano that's perfectly tuned in one key, the notes that sound gross in other keys are *really* close to being in tune in those keys. They're just ever so slightly off, and if you tune them up or down juuuuuust a little, they sound okay again. But then when you go back to your first key, the notes you fixed sound like shit there.

In a perfect world, you'd always be able to retune your instrument while playing, but we live in a world where most Western musicians write music at a keyboard. You've only got 12 keyboard keys per octave, and it's really difficult to retune the damn thing. So Western theorists decided, a few hundred years ago, that we should look for a way to just kind of fudge the intervals all the way across the keyboard so that, yeah, they're out of tune, but they're out of tune consistently no matter what key you're playing in, and hey, it's close enough. That tuning system is called Equal Temperament.

Talk to a really good string player some time and ask them about the differences between how they tune when they're playing with a piano and how they tune when they're playing in a string quartet. If they're doing it right,  they'll say that when they play in a quartet, they constantly have to adjust their intonation to get an optimal sound. They might play a note in one spot, but then the music will change key and they'll have to adjust that same note up or down to even out the sound the next time they play it. In such a context, A# would be a different pitch from Bb--in one part, the player could play A# as the third of an F# major chord, then later play Bb as the third of a G minor chord. They will be two different pitches, and the player's fingers will have to adjust just a little. It'll be close, but make no mistake, it will be different. But when the player plays with a piano, A# and Bb will be played as the same note because the piano is playing in Equal Temperament.

Equal Temperament is really only optimal for pianos, but it's gradually crept in and infected everything, so that now, even when we're talking about instruments that can retune at will like strings and voices, only very well-trained players now know how to listen for the real tuning. The upshot is that everything you've ever heard played at a piano, and 99.9999% of all the other Western music you've heard (classical and pop both), is out of tune. If you played it for a Western musician who lived 300 years ago, they'd tell you it sounded like shit. A violin teacher from Mozart's day would have fucking croaked if they'd heard you play A# and Bb as the same pitch instead of retuning it based on the notes surrounding it. There's evidence that Mozart himself taught the violin using a system that had 52 pitches to the octave to account for tuning differences--at least I think that's the number; I could be wrong. Anyway, I could ramble on all day about this, but if you want to know more, check out Kyle Gann's web page: http://changelegann.com/tuning.html
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-06-07 01:48:59 metagloria<br>For my new album, I'm intentionally composing in non-standard scales, and I found it useful (as a guitarist) to write charts showing which notes on each string are in the scale. This helps visualize things, and can make chord structures pop up outside the triad/fourth/fifth framework, which can be limited when the scales are particularly bizarre.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-07-04 23:05:15 teffflon<br>Some non-expert associations I have with soundtrack music in that broad range:  

1. orchestral arrangements, moving freely between string and horn emphasis as appropriate, but with a more accessible and expressively 'obvious' style than in much classical music;

2. use of different minor modes to create a sense of mystery, exoticism, and danger (I think of Bond-style themes as 'danger music').  This use of minor modes and melodies can show an influence from Spanish classical / Flamenco music and probably other traditional European sources.  In that line, classical guitar can play a role in the instrumentation as well;

3.  occasionally soundtracks will ham it up with 'exotic' instruments and themes, sometimes enhanced by novelty sound effects.

For more of these sounds, you might explore the allied musical formats of

(for 1 and 2) orchestral pop / easy listening / beautiful music (overlapping radio formats);

(for 1, 2, and 3) the 'exotica' music of Les Baxter and others.

The reason for this is that your hand can stay in the same position on the neck, and the fingers just move across from string to string to get to their note.  The 4th fret might be a stretch for your pinky, but worth going for (move your hand a little if you need to, but don't be tempted to use a different finger).

The rhythm is shown by the vertical stems.  Notes on a single stem are one beat. Where the stems are joined with a little horizontal bar, each pair is one beat, so those notes are a half-beat each.

So the rhythm count of the first two bars would be: 

            |                 |
    |_| |_| | |   |   |_| |_| |
    3 &amp; 4 &amp; | 1   2   3 &amp; 4 &amp; |

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-08-11 21:12:01 AnAmericanComposer<br>Well, I need a moment to organize my response! I completely agree with your general sentiment, that we are two people with very different backgrounds, and different experiences (and different ages!)

For a bit on me, I'm a 20-year-old Indiana resident, lived here for about twelve years. I've been studying music theory for about ten. Almost all of my knowledge up until about three years ago was self-attained, by reading books (I read a book by Gauldin for graduate students back when I was a junior), religiously consuming new music, writing constantly (probably upwards of 2-4 hours/day) and analyzing whatever scores I could come onto.

I am now a university student, coming into my junior year, studying with one of the greatest composers and theorists I've known. I don't claim to know everything there is to know about general theory! I do, however, feel that I'm established enough, and familiar enough, to be able to feel out my own language, my own unique understanding of theory. I kind of had to; nobody in high school, or even the college I'm in now, had an interest in theory like I did, nor a knowledge to be able to have discussions with me.

I am still a bit small with orchestrations (getting ready to work on a string quartet) but I have written for symphonic orchestras. I have a very slow output yet, caught up with work and being a full-time student, but I have also been working on a mini-opera for about two years now.

I always have had difficulty describing my style, because it is still developing and molding to new ideas and environments. In some ways, I am enamored by Schnittke's hypertonality and polystylism (his first concerto is magnificent), but I also love Penderecki's extreme atonal works. I have been studying a lot of Gesualdo and Messiaen, also. I know, I have a bit of a wide net.

For an example of a piece I wrote that has a bit more of a conservative lean, I wrote a passagaclia for Pierrot ensemble (fl, cl, vln, cello, pno) a couple years ago, and it was performed in Spain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hJfORHp_Os

I'm not the best pianist, but I have played for many years, without any formal training. I have several improvised pieces on my channel, and some of them get rather intense. Usually they end up like a theme-and-variations: [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajLiMNg4SSo) | [basic score](http://sli.mg/EtKkSZ). Others, ones I heavily enjoy playing, are entirely made up on the spot. One I wrote ended up with basically a large binary form, that hinted at sonata: [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRHRhAgE5f4) (I apologize for the bad audio and piano... performed and recorded at my school on a cell phone!). This last one doesn't have a score, yet, but I hope to arrange it for viola and piano eventually.


I guess in whatever environment a `C7aug(b9.#11)` would be used, it is better to not even attempt such distinctions, because the idea of a "tonic" or even a "tonality" begin to dissolve, from my imagining. That chord wasn't necessarily meant to serve in a pragmatic sense, like "Hey throw this in over the Donna Lee changes", but instead as an extreme example. I may use such a chord, but it would be in an entirely different system where I guess "pop" theory, that is, the traditional stuff taught and learned about, wouldn't be able to make sense of. As an example, I've built poly-chords that I've used in my music that incorporate 8-11 tones in them. One couldn't fairly "notate" those in western notation as we have been describing it. Not, at least, without an alteration to the notation. I have been prone to using an alteration of chord/bass charting, but making it instead chord/chord, as to help dictate the individual feelings inside the chord.

Example: `E6(b9)` - e, g#, b, c#, f. **or**

    C#M
    ___
    EM

- (e,g#,b) on the bottom, (c#, e#/f, g#) on top.

Music theory describes the "common practices" by which music is made.  It helps you talk and write *about* music.  That may or may not help you actually make great music.  (Assuming you can play an instrument, it *will* help you make very ordinary music, using familiar sounds - which is fine.)
In giving labels to all kinds of musical sounds, it helps you organise musical information in your brain.  (Just remember that music itself is not information.)

What music theory doesn't do is explain *why* music works the way it does.  It doesn't explain why some music sounds great and some doesn't.  It doesn't tell you why or how music has certain emotional effects.  It won't tell you how to write a good melody (although it might give some clues).

If you want to be a great musician, theory is just one string to your bow.  What you really need is to (a) train your ear and (b) learn your instrument thoroughly.  If you want to be a composer as well, then you need to study composition - theory will help there, but many great pop composers didn't study theory: they learned it all by listening and copying.  
Listening and copying should be your main activity as a learning musician.  Study theory as a useful sideline, especially if you plan on conversing with other musicians (about music).

Absolutely. In kid English: There's two ways to change things up within the Pythagorean "family".
Create a W-W-1/2-W-W-W-1/2 loop and move your starting point around, OR choose your starting point and stick with it, but muck with 3, 6, &amp; 7. 

Being able to see the matrix from both sides gives you a much more useful mental map -- and if you're a string player, it's necessary for making truly informed intonation choices.  
My younger students who've been given these ideas (gently and gradually!) from day one have *no* problem understanding that a C# is NOT always in the same place -- that it tilts upwards a bit when functioning as "high 7" in D Ionian, and rings out a little lower when acting as "2" in B Aolian.  

The Harmonic Minor "family" doesn't lend itself to that way of thinking near so much, but then again, I *loathe* talking about the harmonic minor as a "scale".  

Scales are the building blocks of melodies, they're what you choose bits of to form contours. We practice the damn things so we can then play *tunes* with greater fluidity.  
  
In the (standard, normal, Western classical/pop) mindset, the harmonic minor is a *composite*, a construct -- it's what you get when you take the pivotal chords underlying melodic minor: i, iv, and V with its all-important major-third leading tone -- and smurge them all into a single scale.  
For a player, the harmonic minor scale is worthless practiced on its own, but it's *great* preparation for the arpeggiated drills that should come next.  

There's a chicken-and-egg thing that starts to kick in any time you involve augmented 2nd leaps that I really like encouraging folks to think about. Does a scale determine the chords? Or is it really the other way around?   

Is the harmonic major scale really a scale or just a composite of I-iv-V?  

In fact, what if we just decided to see Maj, Min, Dor, Mixo, Harm. Min and Harm. Major as simply the composite-scale expressions of all of the possible permutations of I/i, IV/iv, and V/v ??   

(Melody players don't think chordally NEAR enough IMHO, and we teachers aid and abet them WAY too much) 

And actually, if you're going to start thinking THAT way, Celtic Dorian and Mixolydian tunes really don't care about the  V chord near so much as the bVII anyway. 
  
Looking at the chords implied by all the arpeggiated bits, Celtic Dorian is a composite of i - III - IV - bVII and Mixo is a smurging of I - IV - v - bVII.  

Which means anytime your hitting the *third* of one of these pivotal chords, anytime you're telegraphing its major or minor tonality, you had *damn* well better get that sucker in tune or all the charm of the mode is lost. 

But I digress, off riding my favorite hobby horse. 

And now I'm going to go Google "maqam Huzzam", "mischung 6", and (wtf??) "G acoustic" ---

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-10-03 08:44:07 deadby100cuts<br>I was a music major for several years, so I'll pop in here. Metal and its various subgenre's. Metal, metalcore, deathcore, symphonic metal, folk metal, hardcore, post hardcore, ect. 

I love that stuff, its what Ignited my love of music back in highschool (a good 8 years ago now). I still love music. 

There is just a musiciniship in alot of it, not all of it, but a lot of it thats mind numbing. I majored in music composition, I like interesting music. It can be interesting for a lot of reasons. I can respect music outside of metal, but its normally not something im going to sit down and listen to. The exception being big bad daddy voodo (modern swing), billy  joel, and a few others.

But there is just so much stuff going on. like. I hate black metal. I really don't like it, weird creepy shreaks, bad production, boring riffs. But this band, I mean damn. [This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USIao3W2W1E) is pulling influences from all over the place musically. You have all the orchestra elements , you have orchestration (even if its midi instruments but I can't tell its probably a blend). You have atonal music theory at play, while at the same time you have full string arngements, interesting key changes, you even have some sneaky counterpoint in there between the various parts. I love that stuff. I love when I can hear all these interwoven parts together. you even have what to my ears sounds like a sneaky key change into a major key at one part, but it just works. Honestly thats one of the best compositions Ive heard in a while. All the little horns coming in. Brass instruments go SO well with heavy music, they have a similar timber to screams and heavy distorted guitars.

Bands like epica are certainly easier on the ears since they have a borderline opera singer as the main vocalist. Amazing voice. There music reminds me a lot of the stuff I heard in music history courses. Probably drawing influence from early modal music. Anyway my ear isn't super acurate when it comes to modes, it might just be the voice leading. Their [early stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4YMs0x--fk) she sings in a more classical style but the[ newer stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7IIYIFljZM) is MUCH better written,the early songs get kinda stale halfway through.

Course I like some of the simpler music or more traditional "metal" stuff as well (or whats considered metal by people who don't listen to metal lol).

There is a lot that goes into writing a piece of music and producing it.  A "simple" or "catchy" song can be anything but simple. There are a million factors that contribute to it. There is a goal when writting music. Sometimes its to express something artistically and push boundaries, sometimes its simply writting a catchy and enjoyable song. Sometimes its about expressing an idea, sometimes about making people feel and emotion. 

A song might have simple harmonic content, but have a TON of textural verity. One thing will absolutely kill creativity though, thats elitism. Like, personally I don't want to write the next "mary had a little lamb" I want to write stuff more meaningful. But the flip side is some people DO want to write the next "Mary had a little lamb" something that is super catchy and has been around for multiple generations. There is always room to learn, especially from music you don't like. I can't stand most pop music, Its litterally like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. But I sure the hell can respect it for what it does. Super clean production, melodic content that gets stuck in your head within a single playthrough, pristine musicianship (for the most part). Those are not easy things to accomplish and there is a lot to be learned about what they do good from there then apply the concepts to other styles of music. You can't make something sound dark and heavy unless you know how to make something sound light and bright. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-12-02 04:49:53 tardigraderider<br>I'll jump in as a shitty guitarist to talk about the guitar parts. 

Power chords are formed with the root, fifth, and octave notes of a major scale. For example, a G power chord would be G2, D2, and G3. They're nothing magic- they're just easy to play and sound good, especially with some distortion. 

If you're looking at tabs, especially Green Day or other pop-punk stuff, you'll see a lot of chords written like this:

    e|-----
    B|-----
    G|-----
    D|--5--
    A|--5--
    E|--3--  
That's the G power chord I mentioned above. It has a G note played on the E string third fret, a D played on the A string fifth fret, and another G on the D string fifth fret. If you don't want to learn tab, which you really shouldn't unless you need to for guitar, don't worry about this.

&gt; ...how do I know that they will be easy to play for a guitar player?

When you're coming up with parts for guitar players, you will have to be aware that some inversions or close intervals can be difficult. They're not likely to show up in pop songs, though. Any guitarist worthy of a space on stage can give you multiple different voicings of the common chords you're looking for. With techniques like fingerpicking, sweeps, and tapping, complex arpeggios are pretty easy too. Just tell them the chord and they'll be alright.

**tl;dr**: Power chords are simplified major (edit: or minor, doesn't matter) chords (i.e. removing the third and adding the octave), and pop music like you're looking for is a piece of cake for most guitarists.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-12-02 23:23:13 shortbusoneohone<br>Guitar player here. 


Omitting the 5th is a pretty common practice in almost all circumstances from a guitar perspective, unless you're talkin' classical guitar, which often features barre chords w/ every chord tone present and the root doubled. Leaving out the 5th is, however, used much more frequently within the context of chord extensions — 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths. Music that makes use of basic triad chords, triads with suspensions, or triads with color tones added has a much greater need for the fifth, because of how bare it is harmonically without it — all of the color afforded harmonically by chord extensions. Patterns On guitar, you only have so many fingers, so if you want to play a major 9 chord, you typically have to omit a chord tone (usually the 5th), unless you make use of an open string or a generic chord voicing. 


The thing is...omitting the 5th creates shapes that are also more comfortable to the hand on guitar. So, that has kind of...become common practice, especially within the context of jazz. Pop punk, punk, metal, hardcore...these styles often omit the third, using power chords to create a canvas with interesting rhythms and using the other guitar for melody (and often harmonized variations as well), which features the root, third, fifth, and any color tones that the player / musician decided were appropriate. 


Aside from this, physics and acoustics play a *huge* part in our ability to omit the 5th without really any blowback at all. Because of the overtones present in the root (fundamental) of a chord, the fifth will be present and also be heard, regardless of whether or not it's omitted from the chord physically being played.


Aside from a context based on guitar exclusively, I would say that classical music is the only style that really emphasizes the importance of having all chord tones of the triad present. Any writing in chorale style also emphasizes this, but chorales / hymns / etc, grew out of the classical tradition. 


Anyway, I hope that helped!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-12-27 18:00:26 J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt<br>In jazz and rock and other Blues derivatives you hear it a TON in solos and melody because the defining note in mixolydian mode (the dropped leading tone) happens to also be the defining note in the dominant 7 form of the tonic, which is essential to blues. So for instance, "Ramblin Man" by the Allman Brothers, is in G and the melody has an F in it. You could argue the song is in mixolydian but you could also argue the song is straight up G major and that F is just the dominant 7 on the tonic (later in the guitar solo, it becomes an F#). Another example would be "Waiting for the Bus" by the Violent Femmes where the melody centers around a F in the key of G major (or one could argue G mixolydian). It's almost hard to think of a blues-based rock song that doesn't have some mixolydian elements to it. I'm not sure those rock/jazz examples built on 7 chords should count (some may disagree, and I haven't taken music theory since college really) but here are some examples in various styles of actual mixolydian mode, most without that ambiguity:

- Norwegian Wood by the Beatles (D Major with an C in the melody instead of an C#).

- Vaughn Williams' Fantasy on a theme by Thomas Tallis (the melody itself is in Phrygian mode but there are many Mixolydian sections including the opening and he climax: https://youtu.be/qIhZbvlCjY0)

- Star Trek's theme song (notice how the cadences are very similar to the Vaughn Williams piece above. https://youtu.be/vSMeYe-sLhs)

- one of the sections of Pachelbel's canon (this link starting around 4:45 https://youtu.be/hOA-2hl1Vbc)

- Debussy's string quartet has a number of mixolydian sections. The first one is when the cello takes over the second melody from the first violin in the first movement. The first violin plays it in G Phrygian (like the main melody) then the cello plays it in Bb mixolydian. It's bar 17, or around 0:30 in this recording: https://youtu.be/hOA-2hl1Vbc

- the modern pop example a lot of people give is "Royals" by Lorde. It's a good one! https://youtu.be/7FEkhmlzJbA

-The Doors' LA Woman (though maybe this is just another one of those bluesy songs that is technically mixolydian but I'm not positive should count here)

- Rolling Stones' Sympathy for the Devil. That tonic, dropped 7 (I'm blanking on the name for this. But it's when you go with a C major chord in the key of D for instance), subdominant, tonic progression is common in rock music and often leads to mixolydian melodies. Another notable example would be GnR's Sweet Child O' Mine which has the same basic chord structure. Can't You See by the Marshall Tucker Band. Express Yourself by Madonna and its clone Born This Way by Lady Gaga. The list of these songs goes on and on.

- Bruce Springsteen's Tenth Avenue Freeze Out's melody is another bluesy one in Mixolydian though the harmony is sometimes straight up F major.

- Stuck in the Middle. You know, from THAT scene in Reservoir Dogs: https://youtu.be/-DlNsMIIyU8

- Lowrider: https://youtu.be/6A0U7jakUY8

- the song the nerds play at the talent show  in Revenge of the Nerds is in E mixolydian. Clap your hands everybody, and everybody clap your hands! https://youtu.be/L4Wl2r_VlhA

Hmm. There are lots more examples but that's what I got off the top of my head.  

Edit: was just listening to Sweet Baby James by James Taylor. That album has a bunch of mixolydian stuff. Notably Fire and Rain and Blossom.

Also Fortunate Son by CCR came on the radio. Also mixolydian with same chord structure as sympathy for the devil.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-01-13 01:25:22 Jongtr<br>&gt; I still can't sit down and just write something that flows naturally unless I'm completely ignoring theory

So, ignore theory!  The only reason of studying theory to enhance you writing is if you feel stuck in a rut - if your ear always leads you in the same few directions.  I.e., your ear is always right, and if it works, you don't need theory.  Your ear will always keep you in key, if staying in key is the sound you want.  (Not all music stays in one key.)
But your ear can develop habits, especially if you don't spend enough time listening to a wide variety of other music.  

The more music you listen to, the more your ear gets educated about what sounds good - although of course you need to play the music too to really embed it in your brain.  Theory is handy to help organise the information - to actually turn the sounds into information in the first place, by naming them.  If you lack the experience playing enough music, then theory can offer shortcuts by suggesting routes that your ear might not stumble on.

Taking your example.  You know the G minor scale, and (presumably) you know all the chords you can get from that scale (Gm, Adim, Bb, Cm, Dm, Eb, F).  You can just randomly try all of them in various orders until something sounds good.  *You don't have to know why it sounds good, and theory won't tell you that anyway.*  Theory is a kind of list of everything that most people think sounds good, but it doesn't say why any of it "works". (It can tell you *how* it works, by describing the elements and connections, but not *why*.)

Theory can suggest some common ways in which chords in G minor would go together.  It would tell you, for example, that you can use D major or D7 instead of Dm. (If you read enough theory, you'd know D was the conventional V chord anyway, not Dm.)  It would tell you that Gm-Cm-D-Gm is a standard sequence in that key.  And so is Gm-Am7b5-D7-Gm.  Or Gm-Eb-D-Gm. Or Gm-F-Eb-D-Gm...  You could string all the chords together in a "circle progression": Gm-Cm-F-Bb-Eb-Am7b5-D7-Gm. It's still down to you to decide if you *like* any of those or not.  

You may think they sound a bit predictable or obvious - and indeed they do, because they're *common*.  Theory describes "common practices", which are OK when you want something generic (and often you do ;-)).  You have to read a hell of a lot of theory before you get to the chapters dealing with more unusual and interesting sequences.  Meanwhile, you can hear sequences like that all the time in most sorts of pop or rock music.  That's why songwriters who never read any theory (eg Lennon/McCartney) can come up with often very complex and fascinating progressions.  They just use their ears, without any theoretical prejudice.  Eg, they wouldn't feel any need to stay in the key of G minor; they could go to G major, for example (and often did).

For the soundtrack, btw, make sure you listen to plenty of film music, at least for the kind of film your friend is making
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-01-21 13:12:38 Pelusteriano<br>I don't really think it's about the music itself, but the instrumentation and production.

The following are taken from [10 steps to producing perfect '80s pop](http://www.musicradar.com/tuition/tech/10-steps-to-producing-perfect-80s-pop-604018) by MusicRadar:

1. Synthesizers, like the Yamaha DX7. Although synths were available since the 60s, they got really popular at the 80s because Yamaha made a synth with relatively good quality at a relatively inexpensive price, the Yamaha SX7, [80s sounds shown here](https://youtu.be/11bWvQaQhrM). Notable songs using synths: [Just Can't Get Enough](https://youtu.be/_6FBfAQ-NDE), [Take My Breath Away](https://youtu.be/Bx51eegLTY8), [Tainted Love](https://youtu.be/XZVpR3Pk-r8).

2. Synths: Arpeggiators. It's basically an automatic preset in some sets that plays arpeggios, [how it works shown in this video](https://youtu.be/k0bFALVi3-s). A relevant song is [Never Ending Story](https://youtu.be/Gf1WT8VEZxk). The same sound can also be obtained by actually playing the arpeggio by yourself and using lots of delay (fx).

3. Gated snares. It's a snare with a load of reverb, [this video shows how it sounds](https://youtu.be/N6L_BG0Qhg0?t=1m4s). Some notable examples are [Intruder](https://youtu.be/vAzUh_H7yV0), [The Wild Boys](https://youtu.be/M43wsiNBwmo).

4. Programmed beats (or electric drums or drums from a synth or keytar). Snare was the most important part of the rhythm, usually accentuating offbeats. An example is [Girls Just Want to Have Fun](https://youtu.be/PIb6AZdTr-A), the beat sound artificial and too precise, it always falls correctly on the same beat at the precise tempo.

5. Samples. Basically you take a little bit from a song, tweak it a little to adjust it to your song. For example [Planet Rock](https://youtu.be/hh1AypBaIEk) takes bits from [Stravinsky's Infernal Dance](https://youtu.be/6Vj8ow8iC4s) (the orchestral hits).

6. Vocal manipulation. Delay, reverb and reharmonization were often added digitally to compensate for what would be a rather thin vocal line. A lot of 80s pop songs vocals sound too big as a result of this manipulation.

7. Synth as lead. Synths got relatively inexpensive at the 80s, which took them to popularity, they got so popular that the prefered lead instrument (electric guitar) got briefly substituted by synth and keytars. [Whip It](https://youtu.be/Z56XSG5LUbU), [This Must Be The Place](https://youtu.be/o9gK2fOq4MY). A great asset for synths is that they can handle a lot of different sounds, from pan flutes, to string ensembles to drums.

8. Basslines played in octaves. Basically the bass plays a note and the next note will be the same, but an octave higher, giving this sense of a wide spectrum, [as shown here](https://youtu.be/b05UAklbyUE).

The common operator in all those points is the overuse of synths and digital manipulation.

In the example you provide, taking the visual aesthetics out:

* tempo is decreased a little, to make the song "a little more emotional", like an 80s ballad
* there's gated snares all over the place
* reverb was added to the vocals
* a synth piano sound was used
* overall, the song sounds more "full" because the instrumentation and production is set to "add reverb and use instruments with long sustain"
* musically, something important to notice is the change in rhythm, the 80s version is there to accentuate the reverb on the snare, with big hits on the toms before reaching the chorus, the original version uses 808s drums that have a different sound with a more "minimal" approach, the sound fades out quickly and it's just a snare and a kick.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-02-19 18:31:00 robustoutlier<br>If you can understand the concept of 'division' you are good to go.

Pick a string on a guitar. A wave travels through the string. Let that be the first note A. Divide the string in two, and you have the second note. The wave now travels half the time compared to an undivided string. This is the octave. It is also an A, but  higher, because the time is shorter: the speed of the wave is faster.

Take an old guitar from the 17th century. Call it a lute. Imagine its five strings. Draw the guitar on a sheet of paper, but leave everything else out but the strings.

You can only divide a string in so many parts that the same notes repeats, because of the octaves. That is why we have: ABCDEFGA.

Look for G on the lute. It should be below A, which we picked at the octave, so we move our finger outwards to lengthen the string.

Put a dot where the G is on the music sheet. Find the octave above and below. Put another two dots there. Finally, tie them together with a slur and you have the G clef.

A tone is a sounding note. When multiple strings vibrate at the same time, they sound better together if there is a certain ratio between their frequencies. A frequency is how often the string vibrates up and down. If one of the tones is just slightly off compared to the first tone, it will sound out of tune, but if we pull it further apart we start hearing resonant modes that go well with the first tone. Some are more pleasing to the ear. Consonants. Others are less pleasing. Dissonants.

If you line up a series of consonants, and a few dissonants that can be used as *passing notes*, you have a scale.

Between the lines of the treble clef - the G clef - you have FACE, from bottom to top. This pattern repeats in the bass clef - the F clef - but as ACEG. The line between F and A has to be G.

Two common meters that will get you far are 4/4 and 3/4. Almost all pop, rock, and techno is 4/4. This is sometimes indicated as **C**. The large C is actually a circle that has been cut in half. Because of Christianity's fixation on three things being good, 3/4 used to be drawn as a perfect circle, like the clock, but divided in three segments. A full circle would represent a bar.

The origin of this system is most likely the hurdy gurdy, an instrument with a rotational lever, which is basically a wheel that you constantly have to turn - somewhat similar to 19th century 'positives' or street organs. The C indicates two beats. One at 12 o'clock and one at 6 o'clock. Put two beats in-between - at 3 and 9 o'clock - and you have 4/4.

Why some intervals are perfect, pure, or otherwise, is not that important at this stage. If you can recognize a second from a fifth and an unison from an octave, that's a good start.

I think it's cool that they chose to go down a half step when the majority of key changes that you think of in pop music go up. That and the string part that comes in is amazing.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-03-15 21:02:30 boschkaa<br>Bass primary here. 

Technically String Bass is for wind band literature, contrabass and doublebass are orchestral terms, and upright bass is more jazz or pop or folk or bluegrass or anything else, but we really don't care that much.

I personally prefer Kontrabass because it looks cool. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-03-18 22:52:03 Jongtr<br>&gt; if i move up one fret to the 8th, does that mean its an F chord with C in the bass, because on the low E string 8th fret that's a C note?

Yes.

&gt; is it the first chord of the song that determines the key?

Not necessarily.  Usually in rock and pop it is, but it doesn't have to be.  The key is the chord that *sounds* like the key, which is usually governed by a series of chords, making one of them sound like the "home" chord, that you feel it wants to return to and settle on.    
Naturally, the chord you start on will kind of prime your ear to accept that as *most likely* key chord, but it's still up to you what you do next.

&gt; I know 2nd fret G flat barre chord. now if I take away my middle finger on third fret and then barre D G B strings on 4th fret, how do I know what chord this is?

Assuming your index is on 5th string 2nd fret (2-2-4-4-4-2), you now have the same chord shape as your E/B on frets 7-9.  That means the root is the 5th string note.  Do you know what note fret 2 on 5th string is? (You should... ;-))

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-03-26 13:36:17 Pelusteriano<br>Emotional perception of chord progressions has more to do with the listening subject, tempo, and instrumentation rather than the chord progression itself. For example, blues uses the I - IV - V progression all the time and it manages to sound sad, while at the same time pop uses that very same chord progression and it sounds happy and upbeat. A chord progression played at 60 bpm with a string ensemble featuring a chinese violin would we perceived different than that same chord progression played at 120 bpm with an ukulele.

As a very simple guideline, minor chords have a more sad feel than major chords. If you have more minor chords in your progression, you have more room to make it sound sad.

Considering keys are equivalent between themselves, you can take any song you consider to sound sad (independent from the lyrics and vocal melody) and transpose it to A minor key.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-05-29 18:03:19 Jongtr<br>Different types of music are defined usually according to formal elements, not according to the mood or overall effects.  

So you have "waltz", "minuet", "tango", "saraband", "fox-trot", "rumba", etc, referring to *dances*, and therefore all based on rhythm or metrical elements (beat counts and patterns).

A "march" is also defined by its metre - which will be in 2 or 4, not 3 - designed, obviously, to be marched to.  (It could be 6/8, which is another 2-beat metre.)

Then you can have "sonata", "rondo", "12-bar blues", "AABA", etc. - all based on formal structures.

There are "symphonies" (defined as an orchestral piece played by a mix of different instruments, containing separate sections ot "movements"), "concertos" (defined as a showcase for a specific instrument accompanied by orchestra), "cantatas" (choral works).

You can, of course, have "major key" and "minor key" pieces, or "modal" pieces - defined by their scale structures, not their expressive moods.  (A major key piece can be "sad", a minor key piece can be "happy".)

Then there is the word "ballad", which has a very flexible meaning. In a jazz/pop sense, it means a slow, romantic song.  In the folk sense, it has no tempo connotations, and refers to a narrative tale, typically quite long, often concerning a crime or tragedy.

A "lullaby" is a piece of music designed to help children sleep.  It could be in any of the above forms, it's just played in a certain way, with a gentle dynamic, and probably with very simple instruments (if any - it could be unaccompanied vocal, of course).

IOW, the factors which would define something like a "horror song" are not down to any single formal element like the above.  For the music to be suitably "shocking" (aside from any lyrics of course) it would need a mix of elements: plenty of dissonance, startling changes in dynamics, big range of pitch (doomy bass, screaming violins?), harsh timbres, maybe studio effects such as reverb.

&gt; what would you call "Pink Floyd's" (The Trial) from the Wall Album? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fa7AtI1msk

Sounds to me like something from a melodramatic [operetta] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operetta), or a cheesy Broadway musical.  Something of Kurt Weill about it, maybe, but less classy.  More Andrew Lloyd Webber.   
Obviously it's designed to be dark and scary (the "big" production and the string arrangement), while the bouncy march tempo suggests something mechanical and inhuman - but also kitsch in its heavily theatrical self-awareness.    IOW, for the average Floyd fan, this is far enough out of their comfort zone (thanks to Bob Ezrin more than Roger Waters) that the music doesn't need to be particularly scary to unsettle them a little more.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-07-02 03:59:43 mimomisu<br>I am just finishing an album recorded whole in 432. And honestly -it was just for fun (and to mess up with people trying to learn it later on maybe), also I liked the idea being it in a mix with other normal songs and the transition just sound weird at the beginning.
Anyway, for the string instruments the under tuning does give it a nicer vibe, no matter what the frequency is.

PS: I am sure more bands used to do it but most of R.E.M. songs are in 445 (I think). It might have been because of the mandolin they used to use so often or they just wanted their songs to "pop" when played on the radio
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-08-08 21:49:49 DanGeneratesMelody<br>i was interested in phrasing for pop or comercial music. if its related then let me write shortly what i've researched (on my own, i haven't found any helpful book). when we feel the beat we're inclined to tap it with our foot, or children swing left-right. those pulses are the real beats perceived (Beethoven's ode to joy is written like every note is a beat, so ignore musical staff notation and just listen to how you perceive the beat). ok, so these beats are those points where the child swings maximum left or right. your musical sentence will have a start and a finish on these beats (could be between 2beats, or 3beats with the second beat in the middle as an "and"). every note you play between these 2beats is an "and" (8ths are hierarchically the most important, and 16th are their personal "and"s). some songs have their "thing" like this. a part (say verses, or a part of a solo, whatever) hits both start and finish but skips the "and" in between. then the chorus comes and introduces it and it sounds like a conclusion. i could talk a lot about this subject, but the problem is that while you think harmony is known, i believe we have close to 0 knowledge about it. because in a series of equal notes but with different pitches, you will see how we group our phrase depending on how tones group themselves to form a harmonic block. again ode to joy theme is the perfect example since its a string of equal notes. but we make sense out of it because we group by harmonic content not pauses. so you may arrive to some of my weird conclusions like: melodically harmonies can only be simple (simple triads, no extensions), or root intervals (a 4 or 6 will take the root position, but the 3,5 will give it back). every note has a harmonic function, minor chords -the most simple ones have 2 functions because they are not real chords to belong to a major key. anyways, if you're interested, also in researching not only listening to me, but actually trying to find how things work, then pm me.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-08-11 22:48:59 Topscotch<br>Okay, I'm talking to you as someone absolutely obsessed with theory that badly would like you to succeed.  I play professional and I've taught private guitar lessons for years and at this point I've probably taught a total of thousands of lessons.  I even created a sort of joke subreddit based on one little theoretical concept that had some success.

I think you really need to make sure you can read your music well and play an instrument a bit more proficiently so that you get as much out of the classes as possible.  Music isn't 100% like a language, but let's think of it like one as far as learning your theory.

Have you ever taken foreign language classes like Spanish and ended up far from fluent?  It's usually because those classes spend much more time on grammar instead of practically having you listen and engage.  Now imagine taking a Spanish class like that, but you don't even have a good grasp on reading the alphabet or speaking words at all.

If you took a theory class now, you could succeed at it I bet.  I'm not saying you'd fail at doing it.  You'd probably be able to comprehend a lot and do things right with study.  What I am saying is that the information may not be as meaningful to you as it would if you had a more physical and practical connection to an instrument first and a higher ability to read music.  It will be difficult to keep up with dealing with deep musical patterns if it takes you several seconds to look at a note and know whether it's a C or a B.   Imagine doing your SAT when you have to stare at the letter A for a little bit to figure out whether it's an A or not.  Even if you do keep up, the difficulty in dealing with this may be distracting from really getting a deep understanding out of it, since you will barely be surviving, and you may lose interest.

I'll try to give an example of what I mean with a basic concept you'd learn.  You may remember playing your major scales on trumpet/trombone.  A major scale is a pattern people are singing when they sing solfege, Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do.  A lot of songs can be said to come from major scales.  The scales all come from a pattern that they usually teach early on in a theory course.  Now, if you are rusty on your notes and haven't played much music, you still will probably be able to understand the pattern and even apply it correctly.  However, if you actually know how to play all or most of your major scales well and have played a lot of music that uses them (whether you were aware or not), there is a deeper level to which learning them will be meaningful to you, because you will be making connections with the actual music you know in your fingers and head well.  If you know an instrument and sheet music well first:
1. Your learning isn't inhibited by your difficulty in reading notes
2. You get to have a lot of "a-ha" moments where you realize more viscerally why a lot of music you know sounds and works the way it does.

The information falls flat on people if they don't have a lot of practical connections with music made.  If you've played a 
good bit of music, then the theory is wildly meaningful as your ears have something to relate it to profoundly.

A lot of classical music majors will go straight from high school band to music school having learned no theory whatsoever, but the difference is that they are probably good at reading and playing already.

One other problem you'd run into is the fact that it is helpful to be able to play what you learn proficiently.  When they teach you about chords and scales in different permutations, it is helpful to be able to pick up an instrument and actually play these things so you can really hear them for yourself instead of just hearing the teacher play them a couple times on the piano.  You can really play around with them and see how they work on a first hand basis.  You're an engineer.  What is a more meaningful understanding of fluid dynamics, an equation about it, or seeing and feeling a fluid slosh around?  If you had never seen fluids much before, how meaningful would fluid equations be?  The combination of those two understandings is what makes someone really potent.  Like engineering, there is a craft and a science.  You probably couldn't have started an engineering job with no training with only having taken notes and done written tests, right?  Someone had to show you how to physically do your tasks I'm sure.  Just like how you could have passed written parts of physics and engineering classes without being able to do a job, you can learn your theory without having anything you can do with it.

You absolutely have potential to do this, but I want you to understand that it is more complex than just going to class if you want the information to mean more to you.  I have taught a lot of adult students that want to understand theory like I do, and the biggest problem they have is not their neuroplasticity but their patience.  They are my absolute least patient students, ironically, compared to children.  Children don't have a concept of "I *should* be able to do this by now" so they will simply keep working if they want to get better.  Adults are very conscious of how slow the process is and how bad they are that they quickly will decide that they can't do it, when all they had to do was work a little big longer.  They also fish for excuses and shortcuts the most, because they can.

Here's my advice: spend time playing and reading music for longer first.  This is your real Theory I.  It's not that you couldn't take the class, it's that you will get so much more out of it later.  Guitar is notoriously hard to read music on, but it is actually one of the best instruments for theory once you get good with it, because you can actually see consistent musical patterns fleshed out on the fretboard better than even pianists get to see, but you might consider learning basic piano too since it's very accessible as far as reading sheet music.  

There's a lot out there on how to read music and learn songs on guitar or piano or whatever, so I won't go into too much detail, but here are some basic steps I'd take if I were you (not all in particular order):

1.  On whatever instrument you're doing, make sure you start learning your notes on the staff well.  On guitar there is a book called the Modern Method for Guitar by William Leavitt that I used to learn to read and learn my scales.  It is a little fast-paced, but it might not be a problem if you combined it with using the internet for things you get stuck on in it.
2.  Try to get to the point where you can read music in different keys well.  If doing guitar, try to start learning the notes on each fret and string so you can know your fretboard(take it slow).  Pop quizzing yourself is a good way to learn this kind of stuff as you get going.
3.  Learn music you like.  This could be tabs or sheet music depending on your ability.  Doesn't matter how you learn it, just learn how to play it.  You could consider learning songs that get stuck in your head, even if they aren't your favorite, just because these are really in your ear and may be useful to know practically.
4.  Don't ignore learning simple melodies and perhaps chords that could go along with them.  I'm talking about Mary Had A Little Lamb, Happy Birthday, Yankee Doodle, etc.  These are, of course, boring and stuff you wouldn't play in your car, but they are boring and childish because from a theoretical standpoint they are very short and simple.  It will be useful to know how to play short, simple music because you will probably analyze short, simple music at first when you study theory, since it's a great place to start, though they may use excerpts from Bach, Haydn, Mozart, etc at first, too.

Everyone that thinks that music sounds like music knows theory deep down, so the main goal of theory, in my opinion, is to get you to learn what you already know, and put the right name to the right kind of thing, because music looks like a big mess without it.  You need to dive into the mess first though so that you have something to make sense of in the first place.  When my guitar teacher first taught me some theory, I had played for a while and was at a point where music seemed like one giant meaningless chaotic blob of notes and chords with no discernible overarching patterns, and the beginning of theory was the most cathartic thing ever at that point.  If I had learned it before that, it probably would have seemed more weird and boring.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-09-22 02:11:01 xiipaoc<br>&gt; When people invent things they usually start out creating relatively simple things then as the knowledge accumulates they move onto creating bigger and more complex things.

Why do people still write limericks despite them being somewhat poetically simpler than, say, Homer's epics?  Simplicity is part of the function of the work, not the technological advancement of the work.

The thing is, pop music is *much* more complex than classical music.  Classical music uses acoustic instruments, for example.  Pop music uses some of those too, but it mostly uses electronic instruments.  Any reasonably smart person can understand how a wind or string instrument works -- you make stuff vibrate, easy.  But an electronic instrument requires basically a computer!  It can still be analog, but circuits are complex, while shortening the effective length of a string with your finger is pretty damn simple.

Pop music also depends on a method of distribution that's far more complex than classical music.  Classical music would be published as scores for people to play or, well, played at concerts.  Simple.  Sheet music is actually less simple, which is probably why it took centuries to be developed.  But then, audio recording was invented.  Record players were invented.  Better types of audio records were developed, to the point where you can store audio in a computer file; you don't even need a wax cylinder or a disc or a tape or anything!  Well, there's an electronic disk somewhere (even if it's solid-state and doesn't actually spin, but anyway).  So any idiot now can easily listen to a piece of music.  There's infrastructure that allows this to happen.  And said idiot *does* listen to music, which means that people who write music that the idiot can enjoy can make money selling it to the idiot.  The economics are complex too!  So while before only elites really had the chance to consume classical music (non-elites had their music too, though -- folk music, church music, bards, stuff like that), now non-elites have wide access to music and there's therefore a large contingent of people who will pay for simpler music, not more complex music.

(I'm definitely not saying that people who like pop music are idiots!  But people who are not smart, not "cultured", etc. still help drive the music industry, and they participate heavily in their own musical culture.)

So yeah, it's not clear that classical music is more complex than pop music, except maybe in terms of compositional technique.  In everything else, pop music is more complex.

You mentioned you played Jazz and listen to Nirvana and David Gilmour which is awesome both are unique in their style of music. Metal is great too. One thing that has helped me is switching tunings to get some unique sounds. Classical music has helped immensely as well. I'll make up my own chords although i'm sure 99% of them have been discovered already. Most people play in key too which is great but when i'm coming up with stuff I won't even worry if i'm in key or not. If my ear likes the sound of it i'll keep it memorizing these chords then put them together with the ones I like. Listen to metal one day, rock on another, classical the next day. Country, Flamenco, Jazzy blues. Vitamin string quartet's improvisations of pop songs are great. There honestly isn't no song I don't like execpt for main stream repeatative rap/hip-hop. Maybe even try switching to the exotic scales. And listening to music from other countries. These things has helped me improve. Notice when watching many musicians playing live they will close their eyes and open their mouths at times when doing instrumentals that shows that they are feeling the music and getting into it, this is the **key**

Is the instrument guitar, or piano, or electric keyboard, or synthesizer, or a string ensemble, or a choir, or something else?

What is the arrangement like?  Is the chordal instrument the only instrument, or is there a separate bass instrument?  Are there backing vocals also singing chords?  Is the lead vocal also harmonized?  

Do you want your chordal instrument playing long chords, or short, rhythmic ideas?    Does the bass follow the harmony of the song or stay on a pedal tone?  Is the harmonic rhythm fast or slow compared to the vocals?

While a lot of what they do seems to be things with "pop appeal", they were no slouches performance wise. I've only seen the one program they did that time but I would bet they'd be OK with it.

Maybe what you should do is look at Eliot Carter's String Quartets. There's at least one movement from one that does just what you're talking about - a different division in each part.

What's funny about string players is you'll get "you should start this phrase with an upbow" long before you get "I can't play this rhythm"! (at least IME).

Sounds like a great opportunity - I'd say, don't be afraid to be experimental - you'll learn more from your mistakes and their comments!!!

Good Luck. Let us know how it goes!


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-11-25 05:58:20 65TwinReverbRI<br>Hmm, tough call.

Do you have any kind of Arts Schools or what we here in the US call "Magnet" schools? They're usually designed for High School age students (here, roughly 14-18) as a more focused study in an arts field such as music, art, theater, dance, etc.

Most of them act as sort of "prepatory" schools for entry into a university music program.

Otherwise, would it be possible for you to take any classes at either a local University or music school associated with the University? Many offer summer classes here that are open to non-degree seeking students. Also, there may be "schools of music" of music teacher who teach violin, and piano, and voice, and guitar, and tuba, and etc. etc. etc. that all teach out of the same location. Usually they can recommend a good teacher so even if it's not guitar, they might have someone that can teach you theory.

But really, studying with a teacher who knows theory, or augmenting lessons with theory instruction is your best bet. Theory by itself is an abstraction - it's better for you to learn it in a musical context, especially one where you can apply what you learn.

You were playing what I'd call "Classical Guitar" which is "art music" for Nylon String Acoustic Guitar. I know those pieces and they are considered "recital level" pieces at my university - IOW they're not "beginner" pieces.

To be hones with you, Classical musicians tend to study harmony on their own less because they're concentrating on learning the established repertoire for their instrument. Usually, they major in music and get their theory education there. And generally that's about all the theory they ever need.

I'm not sure when you say "I have other passions too" - are they musical? Or are you talking Football (we call it Soccer here)?

I mean, to be honest, if you just have a "passing interest" in guitar, I'm not really sure that learning any theory is going to help you rekindle that interest.

When you say "I don't have any theoretical knowledge" what do you mean. Can you read music? I would assume so if you're playing those pieces.

Are you saying you don't know what chords you're playing?

Are you losing interest in "classical" guitar and would rather play pop or jazz styles?

What is your goal here?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-12-13 20:58:45 octatonic_formula<br>Great idea, and beautifully done.  The layout, colors, music examples, and everything wonderfully done.  A few suggestions:   

Often the first info someone looks for about an instrument is the written range of an instrument as shown on bass and treble (and alto and tenor) clefs;  so I think the 'buttons' should also show, on a score, the bottom and top note. Maybe that would be too crowded and you need a separate graphic for that.  Sometimes that's done on a single staff system, each instrument next to each other, bottom and top note.

In classical orchestration, other standard info in instrumentation is what clefs the instrument appears on (for example, bassoon using tenor clef), and which are transposing.  The legend in upper left gives the appearance that it would be an 'html' button which, if you clicked it, would rearrange the buttons just for that category.  I would like to see...transposing instruments (bass clarinet, clarinet, horns) grouped together if they so choose.

The buttons are not HTML type?  

Special effects like string harmonics, horn mutes.

At the top left, there's color coded legend (wind percussion).  The colors of your page are wonderful, but is it possible, if you click the legend button for, for example, winds, that all the buttons will re-arrange into sections?  However It's sort of nice how the different categories are jumbled together; it gives a nice color effect (which I think is just as important as content issues), so maybe it's a trade off where you can't do both.

Some of the instruments are used more by classical orchestra than jazz or pop, so could the music examples accordingly be well known ones from classical repertoire?  That's what most orchestration books do.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-12-22 08:26:04 Yeargdribble<br>My point is that the world of professional concert pianists is so exceedingly small as to be pointless.  You literally listed some of the top classical concert pianists to live.  My point was you have a better chance of being an NFL quarterback.   Who would tell their kids to hang all their hopes and dreams on athletic success?  If you think putting all your eggs in the pro-football basket it foolish, it's no different for a classical concert pianist.  The demand is ridiculously low.  We're talking about a fraction of 1% would ever actually be able to make a career out of it and I think that's being generous.

Meanwhile, there's a much broader target and tons of other jobs playing piano at large, but instead the vast majority of people get a degree that focuses on the skill set of the smallest job market probably in all of music?  If they learned to be a good accompanist or learned to sit in with jazz bands or play with pop groups they would have infinitely more job opportunities.

And if you say, "That's no what speaks to them" or some equivalent... welcome to the real world.  If you want to get paid to do something, sometimes you will have to work on skills that aren't to your personal taste.  But it's real first world problem to complain that you're having to learn Latin jazz to help make a living playing music.

---

And about memorization.  There is a point where you might memorize a piece of music through sheer volume of thorough practice.  Yeah, did that for solo competition in HS (on trumpet).  I could prepare that same literature that took months then in a week or more.  At that point memorization would be an *extra* step.

Very good professional musicians constantly play with very good musicality while reading and even while sightreading.  When you play less well or read less well, and you're playing at the bleeding edge of your ability, yeah, you might need that little fraction of extra concentration that memorization offers (with risk of forgetting leading to an rocky recovery).  But when you're a better player and a better reader, you really don't need that extra little bit because the music is easy to you.  You could probably play a C major scale just as musically looking at the music or your hands because it's not challenging to you.

I frequently end up playing with small chamber groups where we are given the music sometimes the day before the gig, or even hours before.  We all read well enough to play very musically, listen to each other, follow the conductor, pay attention to style and balance, all while reading the music for the first or second time.  When you have a certain level of technical and reading mastery, reading doesn't affect musicality at all.  

Most wind/string players are fully aware of this.  It's just the culture within the music they play.  They play in ensembles and frequently are playing a pretty large volume of different music in different styles, sometimes just counting rests and listening.  They play a lot of music at or slightly above their level rather than constantly at the top margin.  They are used to following a conductor and paying attention to those around them.  But pianists so frequently spend all of their time alone playing a very small number of exceedingly difficult pieces.  They never develop the awareness that you *can* read and play musically at the same time.  Yes, piano is much harder and has a lot more going on, but that just means the bar is higher... it doesn't mean it's impossible.  Pianists just make an excuse about it because it's so much a part of piano culture to *not* have developed those other skills.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-07 05:19:15 65TwinReverbRI<br>Well, besides tradition, widespread use.

I would bet that, a musician trained in say, Japan, might be trained with Italian terms so it's more likely overall that Italian terms are more "universal" in music than English (or French or German, etc.) terms.

And I would also add this:

If you're writing a Symphony, or String Quartet, or if you're writing music in a style that's 300 years old, well, "Anglicizing" the musical terms is kind of silly - it's like you want to modernize (or simplify) one thing because you're too lazy to learn it, while living in the past with everything else.

Most of the composers who wrote musical terminology in their native language were part of the trend of "Nationalism" which not only saw a rise in composers of French, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Finnish, Swedish, and even American and South American music, but a rise of PUBLISHERS of that music who adopted "native language" terms - I wouldn't surprise me if the crafty publisher made copies in various languages - at least Italian and native - to sell more copies! I've seen scores with 2 languages for every marking.

There were a number of American composers in the early half of the 20th century who use English only as both a form of nationalist pride, and as a break from tradition (as the music was breaking from tradition).

It seems to have been somewhat of a fad in that many "neo-Romantic" or whatever John Williamsian age we're now living in is called, have gone back to more traditional Italian terms for the more traditional kind of music they're writing.

Of course, for pop music styles, English all the way.

I usually just use English, since it's become so widespread in the world I think it'll be OK. But it's not because I was unwilling to learn the Italian terms. The most recent piece, for some reason, I also included Italian terms in parentheses - my thinking was that as you mention, sometimes there's a traditional concept that the musical term in Italian carries with it that the English translation just doesn't capture.

So those three reasons would be primary:

Tradition

Universal understanding (though English is quickly getting there)

Traditional non-translatable meanings

But I'll also add this about the 2nd one - I'd rather see a score by a Japanese composer with Italian terms instead of Japanese writing.

English speakers and especially Americans (I'm one) have a tendency to be a little one-sided about this.

So if you choose to use English and not Italian, make sure you have a good reason for doing so - one with honorable intentions rather than just laziness or ignorance.

I once wrote a piece with only two dynamic levels and I wrote "loud" and "quiet" for the dynamics rather than Piano and Forte, becuase I didn't want any per-conceived notions about how loud or quiet they were supposed to be - just different levels was all I needed. So what I felt was a good reason for abandoning the traditional terms (but even when I use English instructions, I still use "pizz" and "arco" and "mp" and "sfz" and things like that, that have become "stock" terms).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-08 08:45:30 65TwinReverbRI<br>Ok, from a non-Jazz perspective:

The only two types of o7 in CPP music are those that function as Leading Tone Diminished 7th chords, and those that function as Common Tone Diminished 7th chords.

LTo7 come in two flavors - the ones native to the key, like viio7, and the ones that are secondary chords - viio7/X

Most jazz people haven't learned about Common Tone Diminished 7ths (and for that matter, neither have a lot of people who haven't been through or remembered a 4 semester college theory education).

In analysis, some people just write ct^o7 and leave it at that.

Some schools of thought just "name" chords with a number and don't really spell out their function, which I don't care for.

For example - #iv^o7 - well that's almost always a vii^o7 /V

In that school, sometimes you see something like i^o7 or #ii^o7 or something of that nature.

With a little explanation this will make sense:

C - A - C

G - F# - G

E - D# - E

C - C - C

The chord in the middle is some kind of o7 - but you can see it's really a result of neighbor tone motion. The bass note is common with the root of the surrounding chord, which is why it's called a "common tone" o7 - IOW, unlike "normal" secondary LTo7 chords, there's a common tone here, and that's the distinguishing characteristic.

IN some ways, it's not really a chord at all, in that it's really just a result of multiple neighbor tones happening simultaneously that happen to form a chord. In Kostka/Payne's Tonal Hamony, what they do is give "letter names" to chords like this that are non-diatonic "resultant" structures that are results of voice-leading, or "voice-leading chords".

A lot of things in Jazz and pop music are the CTo7 - the cliché "honky tonk 6ths" which are similar to the Basie Ending are linked to it. The notes are formed by passing tone motion rather than neighbor tones, but the idea is the same:

E - Eb - D - C

G - Gb - F - E

C - C - C - C

Often, the 6th of the chord will be present (forming a full o7 chord on the 2nd chord) or some other chromatic line as well.

The only other viio7 chord in CPP music are "linear" and non-functional chords - again, sometimes just "resultant" of non-chord tone motion.

For example, sometimes you get strings of o7 chords that could be considered LTo7 but when they resolve, the resolve to another o7 chord - it's not unlike how V7/ii can resolve to "II", which is V7/V - you get viio7/X that resolves not to X, but to viio7 of Y, that reolves to viio7 of Z, and so on. Because of the nature of o7 chords (symmetry) you can end up with chromatic ascents and descents that make perfect sense in a sequential manner.

But labeling all of these is usually not something people to. It's more just "a string of o7 leads to..."

Probably forgetting something, but I think that's the main gist.

And the chords.

And the progression.

Just a bit of advice: I would avoid statements like "haven't developed that far yet" becuase it could be inferred from a statement like that that you see earlier music as "inferior" or something.

It is "reminiscent" of "Classical" guitar in that it's played on a nylon string and that it uses arpeggios in a manner not unlike typical guitar preludes and etudes in method books, which I'm sure Lifeson played, and were the inspiration for this.

It uses "rock" chords and progressions though. While Lifeson is brilliant, it's much more of a "rock guitarist trying to sound classical" than a well-informed classical composer. It's clear there are inspirations from other places (possibly their Canadian brethren, Triumph, in Rik Emmet's use of Classical Guitar).

I'm not saying that myself to "lessen" the quality of the piece - I think that was wholly his intent - to do something classical like but that used contemporary rock player chords - especially what had coalesced in his playing through all his various influences.

One of the more "pop" elements is the use of a bass line that moves from the root to hte 5th of the chord. That's kind of uncharacteristic even of classical guitar prelude/etude like pieces.

But we could absolutely consider it a "Contemporary Classical Guitar Prelude" - which is what it is - it's certainly a prelude to The Trees. 

But I'd say it's a "contemporary" sound.

There's so much focus on common practice period theory and virtually none spent on contemporary/jazz theory in most programs unless you're specifically studying jazz.  Someone can have graduate degrees in music and have a deep understanding of period counterpoint, but not be able to spell a CMaj13#11.  For many, they literally can't spell any chord bigger than a 7th and don't know how to read jazz chord symbols at all.

Meanwhile, there's intense focus on idiotic things like avoiding parallel/direct 5ths/8ves and fussing about different types of aug6 chords.  Both of these have so little practical value.  This type of thing should be reserved for graduate level classes for those who give a shit about period music.  The fact these overly rules obsessed ideas get focus in lieu of even basic jazz theory is mind boggling.  Most students drink it in not knowing better and not even understanding why they are obsessing about parallel 5ths.  And ultimately, unless you're writing period chorales, it doesn't matter.  Instead they could be learning about the same fundamental concept behind them (good voice leading) in a much more practical context.  

I've laid out my thoughts before about how understanding tritone subtitution actually makes aug6 chord easier to understand... and tritone subs are a much more relevant and useful concept than aug6 chords for... pretty much everyone.

The thing is, obviously if you're going to be a performer, the jazz theory stuff is super important, but even for teachers I think it's important.  For band and choir directors, you *will* end up programming some music with bigger harmonies.  Even if you avoid all jazz, 9th chords and just generally other large chords show up constantly in contemporary music.  Understanding how the voice leading works there helps you direct your ensemble to bring out those pieces of movement.  Or if you need to cut a part (choir directors often do), then do you know which chord members are most important to keep the quality of a chord?  Many don't.  This can lead to balance problems and other things in ensembles.  

Why would you not learn the full language of modern theory?  And I don't mean post-tonal crap sitting around writing matrices or avant garde stuff exploring negative harmony... but actual practical stuff.  Since being out of college (where I drank the Kool-aid and thought I was learning very important stuff) and playing with lots of groups, I'm finding that many people with no formal training have a better *functional* grasp on theory (and usually a better ear) than people with graduate degrees in music.  

Of course, the reason this problem exists is that it's built top down.  PhD programs expect a certain amount of specific theory knowledge, so graduate programs try to prepare for that and so undergrad programs are geared toward grad programs. Ultimately, undergrad theory is designed to prepare you for working on your doctorate in ivory tower music... not the practical theory that working musicians and teachers need to know.

Most theory programs literally stop about 100-200 years ago.  They pretend jazz doesn't exist and don't even really cover most romantic concepts. They stop conceptually somewhere around early Beethoven.  It's also particularly sad in a way that in the US jazz isn't part of the compulsory music theory ed.  Jazz is *the* unique style of America (origins wise) and yet academia seems to think ill of it. There's an overly strict dichotomy between classical and jazz in the academic world and there shouldn't be.  Can you imagine another subject you'd study in college where you stopped learning about advancements 200 years ago?  Science?  Math? It's ludicrous.  

**Performance**

Performance programs tend to focus on preparing people for jobs that don't exist and it ties to the same problems above.  The focus is on classical stuff. Maybe it makes sense for strings where there are more orchestral positions available and no expectation for wider stylistic ability, but for winds there's still a focus on orchestral rep for auditions.

This sucks because those [jobs don't exist](http://www.trumpetjourney.com/2013/08/31/trumpet-job-numbers/).  You literally have greater chances of being a professional athlete.  But there's no reason for this problem to exist.  There *are* jobs... just not in the extremely narrow spectrum that students are prepared for.  These days there's just not room for super specialized people because most very good players *can* do it all.  Wind players are expected to be able to play in pop/jazz styles.  Woodwind players are expected to double.  

You're leaving a ton of money on the table if you focus entirely on classical music to the point that you constantly have to say, "I can't do that" when out in the real world trying to take gigs.

There's also a unique problems for piano programs.  The focus is on very difficult rep, prepared over several months, and memorized.  But in the real world nobody is going to pay to hear Rach.  Nobody is going to expect you to memorize, and nobody is going to give you 3 months to learn anything.  The reality is, particularly for those who have a classical only background, you're going to be doing accompaniments.  This means you'll often be given a large stack of music and a very short deadline.  

The focus should be on sightreading, efficiently learning large volumes of music quickly, and effectively triaging when it's just not possible to learn it all.  Stuff like simplifying nearly physically impossible string reduction accompaniments should be covered.  Effectively using practice time to juggle a dozen pieces of music that need to be learned in a week should be covered.  And hell... being able to follow a conductor or soloist are obviously important, but may pianists have very poor rhythm skills and even worse skills working with other musicians.  Also, being able to lead a group while playing piano is a very useful skill a tier above that. 

And these are just the skills for people who play classical only.  So much of the work I get is because I can comp from a chord sheet or by ear without sheet music.  Being stylistically diverse is extremely useful for pianists.  Understanding basic contemporary theory and knowing how to comp are super important.  I work with people who have been playing literally 5x as long as me who couldn't comp three chords in the key of C without sheet music telling them what notes to play.  People with advanced degrees (in piano pedagogy no less).

I also know players who are great sightreaders... so long as it's hymns or very classical octavos.  Give them something with swing, or syncopated pop rhythms, or large jazz chords and they fall apart.  Stylistic versatility is so important, but lessons are focused on polishing Chopin up to an unnecessary degree of nuance that virtually nobody will notice and less will care about.

**Why?**

The biggest reason why all of this crap is a problem is because the people teaching people to perform... have never performed.  Sure, they played in concerts at their university. They had a lot of experience playing on a platform provided for them.  But virtually none of them have gone out and tried to make a living playing their instrument.  They have no idea what skills are actually useful.

Most of them were trained in performance... couldn't get a job in it, and so they pursued higher level education.  And where does that lead them?  To a professorship where they teach a new generation the same ignorant tripe that they learned.  They are literally failed performers passing on misinformation generation after generation.  I think most of them never even stop to realize that they are failures in that capacity.  It's just assumed that performance majors because university professors who pretend that "classical concert pianist" is a real job (it's not... for all intents and purposes it does not exist).

It's literally the blind leading the blind.  The ones not teaching at a university and just giving private lessons and passing on that same "jazz is stupid... reading is unimportant... memorize this really hard piece" mentality.  It's made worse in piano culture because of the dick measuring contest of recitals where teachers want to show off students.  Plenty of piano students can play a handful of very impressive pieces by memory, but can't sightread the easiest music or prepare anything in under a month.

And the more successful someone is as a performer, the less likely they are to teach, so it just gets worse.  A person doing very well performing has a busy schedule that makes teaching a large studio difficult.  Someone doing some moderate work as an accompanist at a church or school has some room for students.  But who has the most students?  A person who never performs a lick.  They are literally just full time teachers completely divorced from the concept of actually playing their instrument functionally.

Unfortunately it's just easier to teach students which button to mash like a trained monkey than it is to teach basic theory, or especially jazz and improv.  So there are just a ton of factors that influence the fact that those who are teaching are usually doing a very bad job of it.  And honestly, very few are doing it out of malice (though some literally are succubi looking for self-aggrandizement).  Most just don't realize they are terrible teachers.  They are just teaching what they were taught.  They aren't aware there's another world out there.  They haven't considered that those who taught them to perform were not actually successful performers, and if they never got jobs that required them to sightread well, they never realize how important that is either.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-30 11:26:59 Phrygiaddicted<br>yeah, i think i have what you're getting at now.

thing is (at least in my mind), i don't hear 12TET.

when i hear 400 cents i dont think "hey thats 4 semitones", i think it's a major third (5th harmonic) but wobbling a bit. (and only think it's wobbling a bit because i know what a *real* major third sounds like ;))

in this way the spelling reveals exactly how i hear it. the E really does turn the Ab into a G# (sound wise) and that's fine because 800 cents is neither an Ab *nor* a G#... so it can get away with pretending to be either.

probably this is the "higher level" you are talking of, but honestly maybe "higher" isnt the right word: it feels incredibly basic. and tbh: i think this occurs for everybody subconsciously or... quite frankly... temperament wouldn't WORK.

because 12TET is emulating 5-JI. that is it's purpose and the whole reason we use it (because it's "close enough", and solves the huge pain in the ass that JI/meantone tuning is). its kinda like talking to someone with a lisp. it is a "little bit off" but it doesn't mean you can't understand what they *mean*.

this is why kinda enharmonic modulation even works... sortof a "ha! fooled you!" joke. their/they're/their. all sound the same. but you know which one is meant at any time *in speech* without disambiguation because of the context.

&gt;in terms of Western harmony

see though: harmonics are a *fundamental property of sound itself*. no imposition of any culture's theory is really required. it's self-evident.

i actually find the way we learn music through the "veil of semitones" really obscures the *very basic* concepts behind how notes are actually related.

tuning a string to JI *by ear* is actually quite easy even for an amateur. you just have to listen for when the beating stops. no need for a tuner or to know theory: just move it until the bad thing goes away. because the harmonics of the string give us a natural template to stop when we are ontop of it and say "THERE!"

you barely have to teach a toddler to sing pentatonics. the pentatonic scale is pretty much *universal* across **all** cultures. and it is just the collection of the 5 most closely harmonically-related notes (such that not only are they all related to the tonic, but also to each other) (C A G E D.. in that order)

this is why we don't really use the 7th/11th harmonic and above in music much. because they don't "play nice" with the 3 and 5. and even getting the 5 to play with 3 is a hard enough time we have to resort to 12ET to fudge a workable static solution (at the expense of thirds being a bit ... naff)

so.. yeah... caveman would hate the aug triad too... imo. the utter lack of augmented triads in pop music (and tbh, almost everything) is my support for that ;) and to be honest, the ambiguity alone probably enhances the dissonance rather than counteracts it.

...man this went on a bit didn't it xD fun though.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-02-02 07:32:38 65TwinReverbRI<br>Guitar sounds an octave lower than written.

If you write Middle C (C4), when a guitarist plays that note it will sound the C an octave below that (C3, or the C in the 2nd space from the bottom in Bass clef - 5th string 3rd fret)

Thus if you want the guitar to sound a Middle C, you have to write C5 (C in the 3rd space, which is played 2nd string 1st fret)

Vocal music is the same as piano with the following general exceptions:

Tenor voice parts are often written in Treble Clef. Typically when this happens it sounds an octave lower than written.

As a side note, you will sometimes see a little "8" under the treble clef for Tenor parts written in treble, and you'll also see them for Guitar as well now. But eve if you don't you should assume that both sound an octave lower than written.

In a pop song, sometimes the vocal line is transposed so a pianist can play the vocal melody within hand's reach - so in common "Piano/Vocal/Guitar" style piano arrangements, the vocal part may be dropped (or rarely, raised) so it's playable while you play the chords as well.

The answer to the rest of your questions is a little more involved.

The simple answer is that originally, there were a lot of clefs and they were all moveable - there's French Violin Clef, which is a G clef that is on the first line of the staff. You're probably aware of Alto and Tenor clefs as well.

The reason for all these different clefs and why they were moveable initially had to do with keeping the range of the voice or instrument on the staff lines - French Violin is tuned higher, so making the clef lower on the staff to compensate meant more of its notes could fit on the staff. Same for Tenor - they sing lower than Alto, but their clef is placed higher on the staff to compensate - so more of the notes they sing are on the staff lines.

Over time, we gradually accepted using more ledger lines (which used to be less common) so keeping the instrument on the staff was less of a necessity.

So we gravitated toward Bass and Treble clefs as we know them on the Grand Staff as most instrument ranges would fit on them.

Alto clef is really only used by Viola anymore. It's used in older vocal scores but most Alto singers now read in Treble clef (and just read a good number of notes below the staff!).

Tenor clef is used for Bassoon, Cello, and Tenor Trombone (or Trombone in general) when the music goes so high that writing in bass clef anymore is impractical. Again, Tenor vocals used to use Tenor clef too, but that's fallen into disuse as well and they tend to read Treble, but sound an octave lower.

Instruments with "contra" in the name - like contrabassoon or "Contrebass"  - orchestral Double Bass - sound an octave lower than written (which includes Electric Bass as well). This is "understood" and nothing else is necessarily indicated for them. As such, Double Bass for example can also go up into Tenor Clef, though really it sounds an octave lower. But again all this is to keep the majority of notes on the staff - if we wrote the Double Bass in sounding range, it would all be ledger lines below the staff.

And for these instruments that switch clefs, switching to the Tenor clef when they get higher in their range (or the Viola will actually go from Alto to Treble when it gets up high) help keep there from being too many ledger lines above the staff.

There are a few instruments that sound an octave above written pitch.

We do have "transposing instruments" - like Bb Clarinet - when you play a C on it, it comes out sounding like a Bb note. This was done so a clarinettist can pick up an Eb, Bb, A, or C clarinet, and when they see a "D" they finger a D - the resulting pitch varies but for them, it's a D - that way they don't have to learn a bunch of different fingerings.

That's exactly like what we do with a capo (or when we tune down to Eb) on guitar - you still play a shape for a G chord, but with a capo on the 3rd fret it comes out as a Bb chord - and most music still writes it as a G chord and lets the capo do the transposition (just like we let the clarinettist pick up the Eb clarinet and the transposition takes care of itself).

So the reason you may not have run into it is that many people will argue with you if you say that "Guitar is a Transposing Instrument" - it "is", but it transposes by Octave rather than some other interval (which some people nitpick and say that's not really a transposition).

As a result, it's sometimes not listed along with other instruments that transpose to other notes (but they sometimes will list Tenor voice and Double Bass because those are more "classical" instruments).

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-05 02:01:24 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;I can't really figure out what's is going on from like a Roman Numeral chord number POV.

And why does this matter? How does it help you?

&gt;When I transpose the part up even like two semitones it doesn't sound like it works, it sounds like it only works in this very specific part on the keyboard, which is completely foreign to me.

That shouldn't matter. It may be that you're just so used to this one, anything else sound foreign, but out of context, as long as the relationship is the same any transposition won't change the effect.

&gt;Is it some sort of Bb13b9aug5 chord? so the V of i, if Ebm9 is our i?

There you go. See. You got it. So now you can call it a "V" of some sort.

See, "naming it" explained it didn't it?

Wait, no, it didn't it?

Right, that's my point. Simply "naming" a chord or "figuring out it's Roman numeral might not be all that informative.

What's "going on" is a common Funk move - and this happens on guitar a lot because it's easy for us to do, is a minor triad such as Bbm, typically voiced Db-F-Bb on guitar (one finger across the upper three strings) moves up chromatically to Bm. 

Now if you place Eb under the first (or Eb and Gb if you like) you get an Ebm9 (this is also commonly done as Eb9).

When you slide it up, you can really put any bass note under it, but putting the Bb under it gives you your odd chord.

Side note - actually on guitar, we can add the 4th string in as well, which is less common, but in this case it adds our Gb to the equation (you could also do Ab for other chord structures).

What this gives you is a GbMaj7 moving up to the G Maj7, with an Eb then Bb bass.

This "moving around a Maj7" idea is common in a lot of neo-soul neo-jazz, R&amp;B funk style music.

IMHO, a lot of pop music is like this - harmony is "incendental" and "resultant" of separate "streams" of music. One "stream" is the chordal stream - GbMaj7 - GMaj7 while the other "stream" is the bass stream of Eb - Bb.

The "resultant" harmony is Ebm9 and Bbgobbledygook.

So is it i and V? Sure.

Is it tonic and dominant? Sure.

But isn't more like "home" and "not home"?

Really, it's more like a chromatic decoration of the upper parts with an alternating bass. So in some sense it's all Ebm9.

To make this a little more clear, a similar common move guitarists do is take their minor triad, let's say Bm to make an E9 chord - and slide it up TWO semitones to C#m.

Now if we hear that over a B note, we might be inclined to call that B13 or some kind of B13 (or simply C#m/B) but if you think about it for a second, the C#m chord gives you the notes of an E6 or E13 (if the D is kept present).

So this "sliding up and back" between these two minor chords sounds like two "different" chords in the chordal stream, but from an E root standpoint (assuming this is on a funk kind of static bass vamp, like "Play that Funky Music") it's just another extension of the E7 chord.

Obviously, in your example, it sounds more like two "different" chords and in each situation it will depend on how the bass line moves - does it hang on the note of the 5 or brush quickly by it, etc. as well as the duration of the upper chord.

But that's the general principle of where this comes from - moving the upper chordal stream by X amount that is sort of "decorative" or "embellishing" the original harmony, and creating whatever coincidental harmony it creates with any other streams, like the bass line.

Listen to the beginning of Sheryl Crow's "All I Wanna Do" - while the bass notes follow the chords, you'll hear this Maj7 up a half step to another Maj7 kind of idea.

I guess I should mention that it's also an idea that's found in blues, where a player approaches their V chord from a half-step above, usually again with a 9th (but could be this minor triad portion). It happens all the time in turnarounds - there's a prominent one in "Tush" by ZZ Top, where the chords seem like Bbm going to Am.

But the bass notes are C#-D. So it kind of looks like a Bbm/Db moving to D9.

But it's a little easier to understand if you see the Bbm as part of an Eb9 chord - so it's really just a half-step approach to the D9 - the approach chord (the "V/V" if you like in this context) is just missing the Eb and G, and all we have is some other bass note.

So it's "about" this guitar stream *implying* one set of harmonies, and this bass line that's playing another stream that has a note that makes some chord, but it's not the "whole story" if you will.

If we put an A note in the bass of the approach chord, we're back to a similar idea as your original (so kind of like V/V - V in this case, where V/V is Vgobbledygook/V!)

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-13 04:13:00 ILoveKombucha<br>For those learning, what SEEMS like a shortcut is often the long and hard way (the question you are asking here suggests you are looking for the obvious shortcut, and the result is that you will waste a lot of time and get inferior results).   *What seems like the long and hard way is the shortcut.*  

Stop wasting your time and learn the rudiments of theory and how it applies to the guitar.   You need to know all the notes, a variety of scales, chords (how to spell them, etc), how to put it all together in the styles you like.   In order to apply this, you need to know all those notes backwards and forwards (automatically, no thought - just because you can slowly figure out that 8th fret E string = C doesn't mean much, you need to KNOW it automatically without thought) on your instrument.   If you are starting from scratch, this will likely take you a few years.   If you work insanely hard, you might be able to do it in a year or so.   As a guitar teacher, I can say that the vast majority of students don't want to work hard at all, and frankly, most of them never get close.    It's pretty laughable (and simultaneously sad) how little people are willing to put into it.   You get out of it what you put in...   IMO, if you aren't willing to work at it, why bother?   There are easier (by far) hobbies.   

Practical advice: Even if you are fairly good technically, it would be advisable to pick up a variety of beginning guitar methods (particularly Hal Leonard) and simply work through them all.   When you can do them all, then work through them again in different positions on the fretboard.   Check out Hal Leonard, books 1 - 3, Mel Bay, Alfred's Guitar course...  and anything else.    Pick up a bunch of related "Easy" books, like Hal Leonard's EAsy Pop Melodies.   Work through the books.   You'll learn first position first (ie, first through 4th frets, primarly).   As you learn it, do all the same melodies again in, say, 5th position.   Then 7th.   Then 9th.   Then 12th.  (Approximately).   This will help you learn the entire fretboard while playing relatively easy music.   (If you have to think too much about rhythms and weird chords, you won't be able to focus on learning the notes).

If you do this, you'll find you have a rare skill among guitarists; you can READ music!   Reading music, it  turns out, is a shortcut for learning the notes on the fretboard.   All of this *might* prove useful, no?   :)

Also, work through all these books while playing the chords and singing the melodies.   If you have to, use a capo to bring the songs into a singable register (and sing the melody an octave lower if needed).   This helps develop your ear, and additionally gives you a very useful skill (singing and playing).    

Keep reading more and more advanced music (but err on the side of easy music....).   Sight read every day.

Give it a few years man.   It's not a race.   But don't be like one of my students, who is literally 79 years old, and has been playing longer than you and I both have been alive (most likely - in the neighborhood of 60 years, let's say), and who doesn't know a lick of theory, doesn't know the notes on the fretboard, can't play in time to save his life, and who constantly complains about having to go back to basics.   He feels that learning the rudiments would be a waste of time.   The supreme irony is that by avoiding the fundamentals, he has wasted DECADES.   I've had students that literally could outplay this guy after one year of work.    Again, don't be this old guy, filled with regret and nothing to show for all those years....   

If you fuck around and waste your time, you could be that guy.   If you suck it up and work hard, you can make impressive progress in a few years.

I would strongly recommend you learn how to form chords by notes - "chord construction" if you will.

For example, if you know a C Chord is made up of the notes C, E, and G, and you know where those notes are on the fingerboard, you can play ANY C chord you can reach. You could play a C on the 13th fret of the B string, then the G and high E (or low E for that matter) open and you'd have a C chord (inverted, but it's still a C chord).

And that's not a "shape" you're going to find in any chord encyclopedia. It's the old "teach a man to fish" thing.

Jazz players are all wet in the knickers about Chord Chemistry. It is "jazz", but really the concepts of chord construction are not specific to any one style - the way you make a C9 chord is the same in jazz as it is in blues, or rock, or country, or classical music, etc.

So you can play "jazz" chords in other genres. And the knowledge you have from making jazz chords is totally applicable.

However, if you don't know your notes, and your basic triad chords, then books like that will probably go over your head.

What you REALLY need is a good guitar instructor!

If you can't (but you **really** should if you're serious) you can find "chord formulas" online. These look like:

Major: 1-3-5

Minor: 1-b3-5

Diminished: 1-b3-b5

and so on.

In order to make those work, you have to understand Keys and Scales (at least Major) and it really helps again to know your notes if you don't already.

Most more modern pop styles (post jazz), especially "rock" or any forms that are seen as "less complex" music (punk, some metal, some, country, some blues, etc.) the "jazz chords" won't be of much use. Again, it's still good to know them but they may be harder to put into practice in actual songs (or find them in actual songs).

But you can start just by learning your Major and Minor chord construction, and which quality which chords are in a key, and start putting them on the neck.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-29 00:53:29 65TwinReverbRI<br>Well, I'd say start with some of the commonly popular ones:

Vivaldi - Four Seasons

Handel - Messiah, Water Music, Royal Fireworks Music

Bach - Brandenburg Concertos - so much to mention, but in order to give time to others I'll stop there.

Hadyn - Opus 33 String Quartets, London Symphonies.

Mozart - "Haydn" Quartets, Piano Sonatas, Symphonies from 35 onward. Requiem, The Magic Flute (and so many others)

Beethoven - Symphonies 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 at least. "Named" Sonatas (Pathatique, Moonlight, Appassionata, etc.).

Schubert/Schumann - Song Cycles (Lieder)

Chopin - Etudes, Preludes, Nocturnes, etc.

Tchaikovsky - Symphonies 4,5, and 6. Nutcracker.

Debussy - Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun, piano music, etc.


There are so many and so many people have favorites but I think even if you start with a "classical music's greatests hits" you'll get a lot of good suggestions there.

I'm more an instrumental music person do I didn't list a lot of Opera - but I think that should kind of be taken on its own - same with a lot of Choral music, or Sacred music, etc.

Honestly, I think if you start with Mozart's mature works, and work your way both forward and backward and time, you'll get a nice perspective.

But there's lots of amazing Renaissance music, as well as 20th century music. 

But the "big" "famous" "controversial" "oft mentioned" pieces are good places to start. Usually any "named" Sonatas, String Quartets, Symphonies, and Concerti tend to be good picks (Haydn's "Farewell" symphony, Mozart's "Elvira Madigan" Concerto, Beethoven's "Waldstein" sonata, etc.)

Some have historical significance (read about Haydn's Farewell symphony) but again, often it's those works associated with extra-musical movements and trends that tend to be "important" - like the monumental Art of Fugue by Bach, which he died while completing, and the sort of similar issue with Mozart's Requiem.

Sometimes this places more importance on a piece than might otherwise be afforded, but it's kind of like, while "Telstar" might not be the absolute best song the Tornados ever wrote, it was the first #1 instrumental in America by an English band IIRC. So it sort of has become a pop culture icon (at least for those interested in history of music) in that way.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-04-04 01:34:09 Yeargdribble<br>&gt;How different did music sound when it wasn't in modern tuning?

Honestly, it's unlikely that actual musicians of the period were *that* good.  The level of musicianship is so much better now and so are the instruments.  Lots of historical accounts of stuff that was nearly unplayable then by the best, but is now the stuff in some 15 year-old's expected rep can tell you that.  Additionally, we do have some recordings of some of the best players and by today's standards they would be considered very sloppy.  Note perfection wasn't even there at the time, so tuning almost certainly wasn't.  So while they goal might've been just intonation, the reality probably wasn't there.

That said, these days most high level musicians, particularly in chamber groups where there are no fixed pitch instruments (and even in cases where there are) will constantly make adjustments to just intonation.

I like to make the point that even if you're sitting on the same note, say and E in a C major chord.... and the groups around you moves to Am, you're now the 5th instead of the 3rd.  You will make the few cents adjustment.

I actually used to know all of the adjustments numbers from equal to just, but now my ear just does it for me.  But yeah, good a capella groups will sing just, string quartets, brass quintents, and honestly a lot of other groups will just constantly move around.  We hear listen down to the bass voice and adjust our pitches to get them to line up perfectly.

All that said...

&gt;I think it'd be cool to hear pieces in their original tuning. 

It's not going to be nearly as different as you think.  I mean, it's something I do and can hear, but it's seriously not that huge of a change.  We're talking about maybe 13 cents at the most here and there and usually more like 2 or 7.  It's moving around quickly enough that you don't *really* notice it.  Sure, ensembles that play just will maybe "shimmer" a bit more as the overtones pop out a tiny bit more, but honestly, it's not nearly as dramatic as you might expect, otherwise playing piano would be aurally horrific.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-04-07 08:53:05 ttd_76<br>Don’t think about the guitar.  The bass is part of the rhythm section, and then pulls double weight as harmony.  It’s not part of the melodic-divas-with-no-taste-or-rhythmic-feel section.  That’s you (the guitarist), and the singer.

When I play bass in bands, I hang with the drummer at rehearsals.  Onstage, I lay back with a beer and get into a nice groove and then me and the drummer laugh at you idiots trying to grab the lights so you can embarrass yourself blowing that 64th note tapping thing you practiced for weeks.  You’re all high stress and I am chill.  So get yourself into my mentality first.

You want the bass to outline the chord changes, to free up the guitar and others to play more melodically.  You will also have to think more rhymically than you may be accustomed to.

As a bass player, what I generally do when working out a part is get the rhythm vibe first.  Listen to the tempo and feel of the song.  Really try to zero in on what the drummer is doing and do I want to lock in to that snare or hi hat?  What are they accenting and do I want to play along and reinforce their story or maybe play a little counter/polyrhythm?  Is this a piece that needs to be precise and tight, or a fun one where I can lay in the pocket and stretch the tempo. I’ll play around with that, just using the root note of the chord changes.

Then, I’ll listen to the other instruments.  Is this piece more melodic or rhythmic?  How much space do I have to work with without muddying up the sound?  Am I walking or keeping it simple?  Can I fit in a bass riff at some point?

If other instruments are playing mostly melodically, I know I need to play the changes and keep the band together.  If there’s a rhythm guitar, I know that person is helping me out both with harmony and rhythm so I can explore a little more.

But basically, for most type of rock/pop music the bass is a support instrument.  I make sure before anything else I am carrying out objective 1a which is rhythm and the only marginally less important objective 1b of outlining the changes.  And it only takes a pretty simple bassline to do both those things.  Then after that, I go for bonus points and add in whatever I think the song needs at any given point.

It is pretty easy to write for bass on guitar.  It’s just the bottom four strings of guitar so you won’t even have to worry about the stupid 4th/5th string thing.  And honestly, you really probably only need the bottom two strings.

So just work out bass parts on the two bottom strings of your guitar.  Imagine it an octave lower is all.  Or buy an octave pedal.  Or with today’s awesome tech, record the line and auto tune it down.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-04-13 07:08:24 Jenkes_of_Wolverton<br>The voicings between guitar and ukulele will be different. The ukulele has its highest pitches on its outside strings, whereas guitar is tuned with strings that go from low to high. So you’ll hear a noticeable change on guitar from strumming upwards and downwards, which is barely appreciable as you change direction on ukulele.

Lots of the guitar’s best known chord shapes (certainly in folk, pop and rock - E, A and D shapes) tend to be open voicings that (from the bass) start off root, 5th, octave, 3rd above octave.

For example, the   lowest root position chord on guitar in standard tuning (E-A-D-G-B-E) will be:

* E Major - fingered 0 2 2 1 0 0 = scale degrees 1, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15

On my concert ukulele, tuned A-D-F#-B an open position E chord will be:

* E Major - fingered 2 2 2 0 = scale degrees 5, 1, 3, 5

Of course in the same way that on piano you can play triads in different inversions, that is also possible on string instruments. However, once you go beyond simple triads and start exploring extended chords, some shapes become impractical because of the impossible stretches - a difficulty which some guitar players resolve by swapping to altered tunings, such as D-A-D-G-A-D or D-G-D-G-B-D to pick two.

Theory? Besides the harmony ...  
  
The chorus is the beginning half of CeCe Peniston's "Finally" but with a slightly different ending.  
  
Arrangement-wise it's fairly standard pop arrangement/production:  
  
Nasally female vocals;  
Mid-pace 1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and backbeat;  
Bass more-or-less pinned to the backbeat;  
Bass drum with a fair amount of click on it (so it works on cheaper stereos that don't have massive subwoofers and therefore can't properly reproduce the thud of the drum);  
Drum-machine-timing hi-hat;  
Whip-crack snare;  
Female backing chorus, occasionally echoing the final words (final words) during the verse (during the verse) and comming in on the chorus;  
Arpeggiated strat on pickup position 2 with a touch of delay;  
Softish keyboard pad during the early verse;  
String &amp; orchestral stabs to punctuate the lead into the chorus;  
Stabs during the chorus to punctuate the end of each section - sounds are probably keyboard renditions of distorted guitars but maybe they got a session player in to strum some chords &amp; then messed around with it in ProTools until it sounded like a keyboard;  

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-06-09 00:15:55 65TwinReverbRI<br>Hmmm, it's most likely something to do with a psychological effect - perception as you say - and may have a name in psychology or psychology of music circles.

For some reason, we "conceptualize" harmony from the lowest note.

This may be a question of why some cultures read left to right, and others right to left (and IIRC, some bottom to top).

The Greeks apparently conceptualized music differently - their modes, which ultimately became (or at least inspired) our 8 Ecclesiastical Modes were calculated from the HIGHEST note down.

There's not necessarily any logic to this either, but one of their instruments had strings and they named the strings according to their relationship to the body "the string closest to the body" for example - whether it was high or low.

So the way we conceptualize notes can be influenced by practical factors rather than solely aural ones.

Even with the first harmony, there doesn't seem to be a preference for whether the added voice was added above or below the Cantus Firumus.

But somehow, along the line, we formed a preference for "low to high" thinking - in the listing of the 8 Modes for example. This may have simply been tied into Left to Right, "listing" common in the language. So unlike the Greeks, early western theorists organized the modes from low to high.

That probably set the stage for our "hearing" the "beginning note" which was also the lowest note, as "more important" and what everything else "related to" or later "was built on".

One of my musical pet peeves is when someone spells Bass "base", but the word does come from the same root - the "base" or "foundation" of what something is built on.

So we have learned, through thousands of years, to judge everything else in relation to the bass note. So as the other poster said, all the interval relations *in relation to the bass note* change and thus change the "quality" of the sound to make it match other things we are *very* familiar with and define/categorize as other things.

But, we should realize while this is a pretty powerful effect, the same can be said about many other things.

For example, one of my teachers early on played a bunch of C and G notes on the piano then played 1 Eb. His point: It only takes one 3rd to really tell us whether the chord is major or minor.

And we can also take the example of adding 7ths - if you take a triad progression, and add a line at the 7th, we'll hear those as different chords too.

And, if you did something like the following:

G - D - F# - Eb

C - G - B - Ab

with a static Bb over top, we're going to hear those as Cm7, Gm, BMaj7, and Abadd9 most likely.

And if we reverse your example, and play a static bass line with moving chords on top, playing A - C#m/A is going to sound like you changed the A to Amaj7.

So it's not just the bass line phenomenon but because it's something that happens a lot in pop music people probably notice that one more.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-06-11 08:18:34 jtizzle12<br>There are great books on these things. I own a book I can’t remember the name of but it’s on the music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Really check out the Haydn stuff, because he was very much the template for everything that happened after.

I think the next step in analyzing is the “how”. Right now you have the “what”. You know it’s a sonata form, you know it how many movements a sonata form has, you know what the exposition, development, and recapitulations are. You know how the theme is split, etc.

So now, try to figure out the “how”. How he orchestrates certain things for them to pop out. How he develops the melodies in development sections, how he transitions from section to section (this brings you back to the “what”, what is he using to do these things). 

After that, there is the “why”. Why is he using specific things. It may be the result of instrument limitations, or maybe he wants certain things to work compositionally.

A really great book, while not orchestral, is about Beethoven’s string quartets written by Joseph Kerman. He talks about a few quartets. A really good one is about the one in C minor. He talks about a certain pitch (specific to register) that every time it occurs it activates a change in the music. Can’t remember many details but it’s a great analysis to check out. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-06-11 18:58:12 Jongtr<br>The most famous pseudo-Bach pop song is probably Whiter Shade of Pale, with its organ melody derived from Air on the G string.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-06-21 17:16:31 Jongtr<br>I won't attempt a better answer (or even a shorter one) than 65TwinRevernRI, who has it all sewn up. 

Your question is a little like asking "what percentage of popular songs from the last 50 years employ a keyboard?" (because maybe you're a keyboard player?).   Obviously lots - and the percentage of keyboard content varies from zero to 100%, with the majority having some kind of keyboard content.  
So - if keyboard sounds were your interest - you'd maybe rephrase the question and ask "OK give me some examples of keyboard-only pop songs, or ones with none at all" - so you could appreciate the effect.    

It's the same with modes: 99% of pop/rock music (maybe more) is modal *to some degree.*   The difference being that the vast majority of pop musicians/composers know what a keyboard is, but very few know what modes are!  Few know or care about such theoretical niceties.

In terms of analysis, however, it still makes most sense to see popular music as "key-based" - but fairly loosely, and there is modal inflection everywhere (at least in classic rock).   
The relevant principle is "mode mixture", or "modal interchange".  It means that major key songs frequently contain chords borrowed from the parallel minor (e.g., D, G, C or Am in key of E major); while minor keys frequently employ major IV chords and minor ii chords (dorian inflection).

The Beatles - as you asked - actually make a good case study.  They had a tiny handful of songs you could describe as wholly modal.   

Tomorrow Never Knows, She Said She Said = wholly mixolydian   
Within You Without You = almost wholly mixolydian (brief dorian deviation in the bridge)  
Norwegian Wood = mixolydian to dorian, with a major key ii-V    
Eleanor Rigby = mostly aeolian, with dorian elements  
Blue Jay Way = brief (but significant) lydian moments  

What you'll spot from the above is that it's pretty much all about Lennon and Harrison.  They were the ones with the "modal instinct" (drawing from blues/rock'n'roll in the first place, and then modal Indian drones later - with mixolydian offering the natural bridge between the two). McCartney had much stronger "classical instincts".   (Eleanor Rigby, of course, was given that "classical" string arrangement.)  

But aside from those, a whole lot of their songs (again mainly Lennon's and Harrison's) had strong modal elements mixed in with traditional major and minor key practices.   
E.g., the opening chord to 'A Hard Days Night' is a modal chord (non-functional mix of intervals) that any jazz musician would be proud to play.  The verse is then straight G mixolydian, but throws in a G major IV-V to tie it up and the bridge is pure G major.  
'Day Tripper' is a mixolydian riff, and the chords are a collection of mixolydian dom7s.  (Rare example of moving to the same mode on different roots. Rock mode mixture is usually different modes on the same root.)   
'If I Needed Someone' is mostly A mixolydian - but the bridge is (interestingly) in B minor (using Em and F# major chords).  That's Harrison beginning to enjoy the combination of drone-style mixolydian grooves and surprising modulations.

Of course, they just copied the sounds they liked, with little or no theoretical knowledge.  There's Lennon's famous response when a journalist mentioned the "aeolian cadences" that a classical critic had found in their music; baffled and amused, Lennon said "they sound like exotic birds."   (The supposed aeolian cadence is the end of the bridge of 'Not A Second Time', where a D7 resolves to Em.)

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-06-26 01:35:25 65TwinReverbRI<br>At least you said "to me" in your title :-)

OK, I would guess that you're maybe a "pop" musician, or listen to mainly contemporary popular music.

While the progression might be considered "Jazzy", you've heard it before:

The Beatles "Something" (George Harrison's song of the Abbey Road album).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelDrZ1aFeY

It's in C here: "moves" is the CMaj7 then it moves to C7 ("attracts me") and gets to the F on "lover".

And even if you haven't been exposed to this song, you've heard this idea thousands of times without knowing realizing it.

So it's part of your musical DNA - you've been conditioned to hear the G chord as the "resolution" because you've heard it so many times before.

And there are also many similar progressions that do this with fewer or more chords; it's not uncommon just to go D - D7 - G (happens in Pink Floyd's "Brain Damage" from Dark Side of the Moon, among many places - super common in the 4th bar of a 12 bar blues as well!!!).

This progression dates back to the Common Practice Period (1650-1850 ish) and even before. So there's no escaping it!

It's the Tonic chord, followed by a Tonic Major 7 (which traditionally resolves to IV, or ii) then on to a Secondary Dominant Chord which is the Dominant to the IV chord (which again resolves to IV, or rarely ii) then on to IV as we now expect on hearing the progression:

I - Imaj7 - V7/IV - IV

Even JUST the V7/? progression may be part of the sound you're hearing which is also super common in all kinds of places. I mean, ridiculously common. It's just been tucked into this pattern where there's also a Chromatic Descent of one note - which makes it seem all that much more logical and inevitable!
_________

But, as you mention, it could go somewhere else.

Had you grown up in the 30s and 40s - the Jazz era - you might have heard something like "String of Pearls" by the Glenn Miller Orchestra (in the 40s), which, in C (IIRC) goes C - Cmaj7 - C7 - C6 - C+ C  and then reverses direction and heads back up.

Jazz players would have been very familiar with the C7 acting as V7/IV and going to IV - even they had played many blues that do exactly that, but they use it in all kinds of songs as well.

But this idea of the chromatic note going up and down over a static chord (also dates back to CPP music BTW) is called the "Line Cliché" because it itself was so common - common enough to be called a cliché! We hear it in things like the opening to the James Bond Theme (up and down), Stairway to Heaven (down) and many pop songs.

But it is primarily a "Jazz move" especially if it was D - DMaj7 - D7 - D6 etc. 

Again, the "logic" is the continuation or culmination of the chromatic motion - which happens whether the chord is G or D6 - the G may just sound more "intuitive" to you because that's what you're used to, so that's what you expect.

I think if you listened to and played enough jazz where you hear the move to the D6 more frequently, it would become as "intuitive" a result as the G would.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-06-27 02:37:08 jazzadellic<br>If you take a college level music major orientated music theory class, you're going to learn a lot of stuff you can't immediately use if your goal is to just play guitar better or compose pop music. It's possible to use 4 part voice writing to make better pop songs, but it will be difficult to see how since you will only learn how to write Bach chorale style stuff. But those some ideas can be used to write the vocal harmonies for your song, or the string section for your ballad or the woodwinds for your jazz band.

Some good goals for a guitarist or any other musician, are:

1. To be able to properly identify / analyze the key(s) of any chord progression so you can a) understand the song better and learn it more efficiently and b) so you can improvise over the changes better and c) so you can write your own melodies better. And also be able to make your own chord progressions. 

2. Be completely fluent in your basic scales like: diatonic major &amp; minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor, pentatonic, and probably a few others like diminished, whole-tone. You'll want to be fluent in any key, and have the ability to harmonize a scale, and use it to write chord progressions, melodies or improvise. 

3. If you want to write your own compositions then you'll want to learn a few other things like phrases &amp; periods, motifs, song form, harmonic / melodic / rhythmic cadences, modulation, secondary dominants, chord extensions, chord substitutions, borrowed chords, tritone subs, chord inversions, voice leading, and more. 

A couple miscellaneous things I forgot to mention: intervals and circle of fifths.

Most of what I wrote above is covered in your typical theory course - over a period of 4 semesters, but if you take a theory course a lot of focus will be on analyzing Bach's music, and other classical composers. I think that time would be better spent on analyzing modern music styles that you want to write in. It's best to start with analyzing simple music and work your way up to the harder stuff. So don't try to analyze psychedelic jazz-funk avante garde first. Start with simple 3-4 chord songs with simple tonal melodies.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-07-18 12:41:30 65TwinReverbRI<br>I would recommend the following:

Buy some published materials, like Alfred books of Piano Music (Mozart, Beethoven, etc.) that are new engravings (i.e. not old over-printed engravings from Schirmer that they're still using the plates from 1912 to make!) and print out some music from Finale, and make the staff sizes match, note head sizes, and all that stuff.

Try to get every element to look as much like theirs as possible.

If you can find a copy of Kurt Stone's "Music Notation in the 20th Century" get it - they're rare and pricey, but you can find used one or get one from a Library (this is sad to say, but many have just been stolen from Libraries because it costs less to pay the replacement cost they paid then to buy a new one online - so I'm not encouraging that, just making a statement).

He goes into great detail about Points and the way engravers measure things.

A really long time ago when Finale was developed, it used his guidelines heavily as it was one of the most exhaustive books on the subject.

Finale has also continually improved so it's even better.

But if you can customize it, and make a template, so you have a "house style" so you can make everything look consistent that would be great.

Also, all your keyboard short cuts - learn them, and meta tools you can create...

do you know how to use Libraries? You need to create like a Piano Fingering Library and be able to load it into a document when you need it. It's got the "basics" but you often need things you can pull in with more complete markings and use. In the old days it made your document so much larger but nowadays with processing power as it is, it's not a big deal. 

But you don't want to have to re-create pedal markings from scratch - and things like that, you need to learn how to enter them so that they're "stretchable".

If you don't know Guitar Fretboard diagrams, it would pay to learn them, and even create custom ones. Tablature is also a good thing to know how to do - actually probably much more marketable. I think - thank god - the Ukulele craze is over, but whatever the next craze is (Banjo maybe?) you need to be able to jump on learning materials and tablature for that. You should also learn Chord Symbols and how to enter those with or without Fretboard diagrams.

Also, learn how to enter text quickly and efficiently - now it's way easier just to "type in" than it used to be, but IIRC you can still enter large blocks of text if you hyphenate correctly (it also pays to know how to do Elisions and non-breaking spaces for Italian).

Then make up a few sample pages - a page from a string quartet, an orchestral score, a choral work, a "P/V/G" work (Piano/Vocal/Guitar - typical traditional sheet music), Guitar with tab, a Jazz Lead Sheet, Big Band Chart, Big Note Easy Piano, Piano with Voice (classical style, and pop style) and maybe now, a pop chart with Guitar, Bass, Drums, Keys, and Vocals (Drums are something else you need to follow some standards for and build into your template so you can do them repeatedly).

You might also consider making some "Music Minus One" style things (don't call it that though as it's trademarked!). Create sheet music with Piano Accompaniment with a Violin Part, or Flute Part, or whatever, so people can play along to a wav file. It has to be out of copyright (as does everything!) or you have to have permission.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-07-23 22:39:59 gravfix<br>Lol. No reason to rag on the V, it's a great chord!

But yeah, a lot of pop tunes use the I - IV for a few reasons. First off, on guitar (which a lot of pop writers play) this is just moving up a string. Secondly, going to the V and resolving makes the phrase seem like its' over. A lot of times they want to keep repeating, so they'll use that plagal cadence for a little less sharp of a resolution.

Same sort of deal with the i - VII - VI, except with an extra step on the tonic VII. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-08-21 23:21:50 banjalien<br>The good news is you don't have to stay horrible at it....

1)I'd start off by taking something you already know the sound of, something you've heard since a kid; perhaps a nursery rhyme, hymn, pop tune, etc.  Sit down at your instrument and try to find that completely by ear.  Start on a different string and different fret with a different finger a few times, ie, different keys.  You say you can find stuff on the fingerboard but it's something to always work at.  This speeds up your ear to hand coordination-hearing something and knowing where it's at.

2)Practice singing melodies back that you hear, make a habit of it.  One thing I find is people take a recording and play a game of fast-forward/rewind, over and over, to the point they aren't even listening any more.  It's a game of hunt and miss.

Don't do that.  Play the music, a short segment and then hum or sing it a few times until you can do it without the music.  Try to find it on your instrument only after you can at least hum it.  My opinion is to start with songs that have words.  Practice transcribing singers.  If you can't transcribe some guy singing quarter notes then a fancy guitar riff isn't a good starting point.  As has been alluded to by Reverb, some of figuring out riffs by ear is knowing lots of vocabulary/licks.

3)Harmony wise-start with three chord songs.  I made a list for all of my students, songs that were only 3 chords songs, stuff they should try to learn completely by ear.  Quite a few were lame country songs but my point was limiting it to only 3 chords and they had to be easy to hear.  The reality is while some music may be only three chords, there are so many sounds going on that a beginner can't possibly hear the chord changes due to the distractions.

The only way you get better at this is what I call error-correcting.  You play along, you make errors; you correct until the errors decrease.  When I started I couldn't even heard a I-IV-V, now hearing chords/harmony is probably one of my biggest musical strengths.  Lots of hours spent playing along to recordings.

4)I realize it's not for everyone but sight-singing helped my ears.  Solfege is what helped me be able to transcribe something without an instrument.  I think singing is great; even if your voice sucks and you aren't trying to be a vocalist.  Sing basslines, sing arpeggios, etc.  All of these bring clarity to your inner hearing.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-08-28 21:56:17 MustBeThursday<br>Memorizing the notes of the fretboard can be kind of weird. A lot of people have trouble with it. Start by just memorizing the notes of the E and A strings from the nut to the 12th fret. Once you do that you're halfway there. Then the notes of the D string are the same as the E string, just two frets higher. The G string is the same as the A string, just two frets up. The B string is the same as the A string, but this time two frets down. And obviously the high E string is the same notes as the low E, and the whole thing starts over at the 12th fret. 

If all else fails you could make some stickers with the note names of the C major scale, put them at the appropriate places on the fretboard, and use that for a bit until you have a better handle on it (though this isn't the preferred method). 

When it comes to getting better at improvising, the things that helped me were getting used to playing the diagonal patterns of the scales, and getting up and across the fretboard instead of hanging out in the standard box patterns. Learning arpeggios and their inversions was also pretty crucial. A lot of great riffs and solos lean heavily on chord tones. A good grasp of arpeggios pop all those chord tones right out of the scale for you, and by keeping track of those you can reference the chord changes by adding in some of those notes as you wander through that scale. 

If you're willing to pay for lessons, that would probably be the most effective help. There are a lot of great books and YouTube videos out there, but the problem with those is that you can't ask them questions. And it sounds like having a teacher in the room who can answer your questions, and restate the answer in different ways if it isn't clicking, is what would do you the most good right now.

There's no need for a full vocal track to be on every guitar book transcription IMO. Simple songs become thousands of pages long. It's overwhelming and it's a big reason why so many of my students are scared of 'reading music'. They buy a book and on each page there's sometimes only two bars of music because of the vocal score, and lack of repeats because of something dumb like a palm muted chord on the end of the 4th time round or something.....

This is why I make all my own scores for my students. I've also seen some really bad cases of 'over-transcription' like in this beatles revolver book:

https://imgur.com/a/mvWG0e6

That ain't no G6 son, he was just moving from Am to G and you notated that. And all the 1234 string stuff. They've literally transcribed the exact time he finishes the transition from one chord to the next. It's insanity IMO.

I've also seen strummed chords notated with full notation and tab for partial catches of the strings. So it looks horrific on the page but it's just a normal chord strum with a normal rhythm but maybe on one up-strum the guy missed the high E string. COME ON!!!!! 

The way I see it, beginners need less information. Pros learn what to ignore in the information. These official books sometimes give you everything and piss off both potential users.

Bass is my primary instrument and bass transcriptions tend to be better. Ideally, I like my songs to be 2 pages max for a pop song using simple repeats and 1 D.S max, and then with some context depending on the level of the player. For instance, a Red Hot Chili Peppers transcription I would use in a lesson, would not write out every single variation flea picks to play over Am and Fmaj7 in californication. I would maybe write out the first one, and use that as an opportunity to show the student some ways to develop his own 'licks'. And then if I'm on stage, the same applies. I don't need every god damn fill, and I don't want verse 2 writing out again for a hammer-on halfway through..... rant over.

Edit: all the vocals, no chord symbols. worst worst worst!!!!!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-09-16 06:59:28 65TwinReverbRI<br>Well, the traditional definition is that it simply comes from a different KEY.

That's why we use that name - it's the "five chord from the key of the five chord" - I know that always sounds confusing, so:

A D chord in C Major that resolves to a G chord is a V/V. That's a Dominant chord from some Secondary key (the primary key being C) so it's a "Secondary Dominant".

It is acting like the V to G, thus making G temporarily seem like a I chord.

So since it's making G like a tonic, we call it a "Tonicization".

A Secondary Dominant Tonicizes the chord which it is the Dominant to.

Just so you know, some people call it an Applied Dominant ( as in, the dominant of some key is being applied to the chord that would the tonic in that some key).

Also many people say it "intensifies" the V chord, so you'll hear those words as well sometimes.

Most of the time now though you hear Secondary, which I think is nice because it also describes kind of "where it's from".
_________

If we see a D chord in C Major, it *could* "come from" C Lydian.

We would just call it "II" in that case. So from a strict perspective, our calling it a V/V means it has to be from another key, rather than another mode.

However, I would say that if there's no other indication of modality, there's no real reason to invoke modal thinking.

______

Back to V/V Tonicizing the V chord - so that's "temporary" because right after, we usually just go back to the primary key (C in this example).

A Modulation traditionally is defined as being confirmed by a cadence. This is part of the definition that many people don't know.

I like to think of it as a bit different from a "Key Change" which is more like what happens in modern pop songs where, you're in C, then all of the sudden, you'r in Bb (which is considered a direct modulation).

Historically, what we'd see is a string of chords in one key that couldn't be in any other key, then a chord or two that could be in the first key, but also could be in another key:

C - F - D7/F# - G - so up to this point, it was in C, and it looks like the D7/C is tonicizing the G as V7/V - but if the music went on:

C - F - D7/F# - G - D7 - G/D - D7 - G we'd probably reconsider that tonicization as being a "pivot chord" where the G could be V in C, but it could be I in G (this is not the best example, but just to use the same chords). So the D7 is acting BOTH as V/V in C, and V in G at the same time - and once we get the cadence as a confirmation, it's the key of G.

This is why I say a modulation is more "permanent" in that it usually finishes off an cadences in the new key.

There are some grey areas in between where you might have keys hinted at but never confirmed, or extended tonicizations of 3 or 4 chords, but those kind of have to be dealt with in context.

_____

Now, understand that Jazz musicians did too much dope, oops, did I say that out loud? Seriously though, Jazz is really a different style of music. It borrowed heavily from Common Practice ideas, but it also modified a lot of them for its own purpose.

For example, we call what Miles Davis was doing "Modal Jazz", but that kind of "Modality" is quite different from what British Isle or Applachian Folk music does, and it's quite different from what Debussy was doing, and quite different from what music in the 1300s was doing - which are all "modal" (it's even different from rock/pop usage in many respects).

And one of the things that seems to stem from Modal Jazz became a fascination with applying modal concepts to everything whether it warranted it or not! (which is why D is V/V, not necessarily Lydian, but you may hear it is from a person steeped in this kind of thinking).

So now we have this thing called "Chord-Scale" theory (or approach) where each chord is "assigned" a particular scale (which could be mode) and certain chords "call for" certain scales.

If you look at a modal vamp, you can see where this kind of thinking starts - you're on Dm7, so you keep playing D Dorian. It moves up a half step to Ebm7 - so, did it "modulate", well, not in the way we think of it traditionally, but using the notes of D Dorian won't work so well over this chord. So it's really "just a chord progression" but because it's so extended over time, it feels more like a "tonal center" based on that harmony - so we do have to "change scales/modes" (or change keys) to deal with that harmony. So maybe it's Eb Dorian there.

When you have chord progressions with chords outside of the key, this happens all the time - now in a more compressed format where it's happening every chord and you have to play a new scale/mode for every chord - or you look for some unusual scale that gets as many chords as you can without changing. And sometimes, chord progressions are built from a scale so there is a scale that goes with them all.

_______

Therefore, the strategy to adopt when you see a chord that's out of the key is to first determine how it's working.

If it's part of a modulation, it could be possible you should be switching to the new key. If it's just a tonicization, you might need to switch just for that chord. If it doesn't seem to be anything else but Lydian in provenance, then you probably want to go Lydian (which ultimately, is the same scale as the key of the V ;-). Otherwise, you might have to just take the chord in isolation, and play what seems to fit.

So you see why we all said, we really need a musical example because it's really the context that determines all this - and when you're improvising, sometimes it won't matter which approach you take because the results can be the same!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-09-25 06:09:48 65TwinReverbRI<br>Well, you're pre-supposing that technology was necessary to compose music - obviously, since they didn't have it,  it wasn't. And isn't. And that's why people who get a DAW thinking it will magically make them compose, can't.

Also, perfect pitch is not a pre-requisite. They would have had very good relative pitch, as do most musicians (pros) today.

The ones we really laud were geniuses, but the fact of the matter is that actually quite a great deal of the populace could compose and composed well as it was just something everyone learned to do as it was all around them and considered a useful skill (cultured).

Michael Haydn (the more famous Joseph Haydn's younger brother) wrote a Symphony that for many years was thought to be Mozart's - it was at least good enough to be mistaken for one! So there are actually tons of really solid composers you just never hear of unfortunately - and that tends to make the "mystique" of the others stand out that much more. 

Actually, the Piano as we know it wasn't invented until later in Beethoven's life. Mozart would have played the Fortepiano and Harpsichord. Haydn's "Piano Sonatas" are considered to be written for "random keyboard instrument" (whatever was available) until about the 1770s IIRC when it became more specific to the Fortepiano. Bach was primarily Organ and Harpsichord.

Here's something though: These people were TRAINED. They STUDIED MUSIC. They learned to play music first, and were good at it, and trained by professionals. They either worked in school or church (choirs) or in Mozart's case, had a parent (and older sibling) who were musicians. Leopold Mozart was a composer in his own right.

These people didn't come out of a vacuum - they are products of a well-established musical system (we have unfortunately lost today) that was not unlike an Apprenticeship in other fields, and these particular composers (the ones we consider famous now) were exceptional students who learned a lot, early, and quickly, and honed their skills over time.

Also, you have to understand that they grew up around music. There was no radio, TV, internet. Music was everywhere. Families would sit around in the evenings and play music - make music. Fathers would teach sons. It was in church, it was in concerts, it was in the street. They were around violins and trumpets and so on all the time. Vivaldi taught at a girls school where he conducted the orchestra - he was a violinist himself and could work with them. Mozart played Viola well.

Furthermore, especially in the Baroque period (Bach's time) music for Bassoons or Flutes was written just like the string parts - it was understood that those instruments could pretty much do most of what the strings (at that time) were called on to do.

You also have to understand that the Symphony itself has a long evolution - the first ones are little more than String Orchestra (Haydn is really considered the "Father of the Classical Symphony" as he wrote over 100 and really developed the form). This idea of a Symphony (the piece) having all these instruments actually doesn't start until mid Beethoven - the earliest Haydn symphonies have 2nd movements that are Strings alone, and the other movements might have a pair of Oboes, or a pair of Bassoons and Horns or something.

There is "so much to learn" and you do have to be "musically minded" to make such music.

But, there is definitely craftsmanship.

Mozart's first Symphony is pretty lackluster. His very earliest compositions (which we have) are pretty simple (but still show sparks of what is to come).

Haydn's earliest music is also somewhat basic compared to his later stuff.

People like Beethoven, and then Brahms, Wagner, etc. had this rich tradition to draw on and learn from.

But think about Mozart - the one who people think might have been the most naturally gifted of all - he STILL took lessons - first with his Father, later with Haydn.

And you also have to understand that not all of this music is as complex as others - Mozart could have whipped off something like some of his Divirtementi as fast as someone today could create a pop song backing track.

Because people learn the TOOLS and TECHNIQUES - and not everything they write is a "hit". Some of it is just OK - and likely, anything that's not never got published or performed.

Look at a famous composer today like John Williams - he started as a player in Henry Mancini's band - (he's playing Piano on the Peter Gunn Theme) and basically apprenticed copying out parts and then arranging and orchestrating for Mancini and others. Basically, he got his break when Mancini was too busy to do some gig and said "Johnny can probably do it for you".

Another currently famous film composer is Michael Giocchino. Look him up on wikipedia and see where he studied.

Most composers of the past were great musicians and players first, and learned to compose along the way (though most had a knack for it and started in their youth).

A month of piano isn't going to do it for you :-) Think years - decades - and it has to be all you do, all the time. And you have to study with a great teacher (look at all the 20th century composers who studied with Nadia Boulanger).

So there is "talent", but, there's also a lot of hard work and those with a little less natural talent can still write quite well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-09-27 23:16:29 flashtastic<br>The thing that helped me was this.

1. Learn the major and minor scale patterns (I learned 3 notes per string patterns).
2. Learn the order of chords in those scales. (uppercase means major, lowercase minor, lowercase+circle diminished)  
I ii iii IV V vi vii° for major and  
i ii° III iv v VI VII for minor
3. So for example chords in the key of C major  would be Cmaj Dm Em Fmaj Gmaj Amin Bdim
4. Realize that the the scale patterns are also chord patterns following the above formula. What I mean here is that the chords are in the same place as the notes. So if C major scale  was on frets 8 10 12 on the low E string, frets  8 10 12 on the A string,  and frets 9-10 on the D string, You can play a barre chord (E-shaped) at 8 with a major shape for C maj, a barre at 10 with an e-minor shape for Dm, a barre at 12 with a minor shape for Em, moving up the scale following the pattern.
5. From there learn a few chord progressions (e.g. I-IV-V is easy and prevalent everywhere in pop/rock). Experiment with these and find some chord progressions you like.
6. After you have done that for a bit, learn the mode patterns and watch a few vids on playing modally. I had watched a video that finally made it click when it was one featuring the modes over a drone note.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-09-29 12:50:44 ttd_76<br>Sometimes if you get stuck on a note you just have to move on.

If you feel like you cannot get the first note correct, then get as close as you can and move on to the second note.  Hear that second note in relation to the first, and then the third note.

It’s probably not the optimal way to do it.  And I think if you try to do a whole song this way, you will run into problems at some point.  But I think for most people it’s more natural to hear things as melodic lines, as opposed to hearing a harmony and each note against the key.

That’s why the first note can be difficult.  There’s no reference for it.  But you can hear the second in relation to the first and the third in relation to the second and so on as a melodic sequence and tell if one note is out of whack in that line of notes.

So until you train yourself to pick out song keys and here scale degrees against the tonic, you have to use workarounds.  Just get the melody (or part of it) right and then transpose it later.  If you can get just four or five notes in a sequence correct then sometimes one of those notes will pop out to your ears against the original better than the first one does, and you can sync up that one and the rest will fall into place.  And sometimes it is hard to hear if just one note is high or low, but if you compare two sequences it is easier to tell if the whole sequence is off.

The other thing you can do is try starting somewhere else in the song.  Maybe you can find an easier note to work with.  And again, if you can put together a little string of correct notes in one part of the song, usually it sort of sets your ear and you can hear the other parts better as well.  Plus you might get enough notes to where you can use theory to figure out why key the song is in, and that helps you narrow down the possible note choices everywhere in the song.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-01 16:44:33 Jongtr<br>I agree pretty much with all your five points and how they're argued.  You seem to come down largely in favour of it, while pointing out that in certain spheres it's not essential.  Hard to dispute that!

But I think you could make a clearer distinction in reason #2: the "many great musicians" you've named are all pop/rock musicians, who one might regard as supremely talented, or at least had/have many other things going for them that rendered reading skills less important.  (You do go on to say that for professional musicians in other spheres it's much more important - if not essential.)

In reason #3 it's not clear why you mention the Suzuki method.  The "learning method of first approaching music through the sound different notes make" is the way all non-reading musicians learn music who have never heard of Suzuki (or think it's a brand of motorbike).  I.e., your "ear training" point is crucial of course, but there is no need to cite a "method". It makes it seem as if one needs to study the Suzuki method as the only way to train your ears.   You don't have to mention it at all (it's irrelevant to the point you're making), but if you do it should be something like "the Suzuki method is a system of music teaching based on learning by ear".

Personally, I learned to read music along with everyone else I was at school with, before I was interested in being a musician myself.  I didn't choose it, I learned it the same way I learned stuff about chemistry or geography.  But when I did get interested in teaching myself guitar, I found it immensely useful, because I could learn melodies from songbooks, and work out guitar parts from piano reductions - there were no books of guitar tab back then, no transcriptions of blues or rock songs, and pop songbooks rarely contained guitar parts.    Of course I was forced to learn that stuff by ear.   

So my point would be that - even if your dream is to be a rock guitar god like Jimi or SRV, or a global singing superstar - having notation skills is an extra string to your bow.  You might find you're not really a genius after all, and an extra edge would be handy.  Musical literacy gives you that.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-02 07:43:27 dlvega_0030<br>Thanks for such a thorough comment.

In reason 2, I would have loved to find more musicians not related to pop / rock music that didn't need to read sheet music. I hope to do more research, and find some examples in other musical spheres.

I am gona change the 3rd reason content, in order to make it clear that the Suzuki method is one of the many systems of music teaching.

I also liked the "extra string to your bow" expression... very simple, understandable, and effective.

Thanks so much :D
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-07 05:09:46 65TwinReverbRI<br>Let's correct a few things.

The Outro in Stairway is in Am, not C, so it's i - bVII - bVI - (bVII).

There's no name for that.

The thing that happens at the beginning, with the descending chromatic line is called the Line Cliche in jazz, but more frequently it's just a chromatic line within a static harmony context like String of Pearls. But in pop music, especially if it's descending and starts on the tonic note and is a bass part (like Stairway) you'll also hear it called the "Chim Chim Cheree" progression, after the Mary Poppins song.

There is an Andalusian Cadence, which is i (or I) - bVII - bVI - V - so Stairway and Watchtower can be seen as truncated versions of that. The full version is in Hit the Road Jack, Sixteen Tons, Stray Cat Strut, Walk Don't Run, etc.

The whole "4 chord rotation" thing has started to become called the "Axis" progression from the Axis of Awesome videos years back that started calling attention to them. It could apply to any of the rotations, but usually i - bVI - bIII - bVII or from the major standpoint, I - V - vi - IV.

BTW, you should use Roman Numerals for chord numbers outside of Nashville :-)

beaumega's post pretty much covers the rest of the "named" progressions.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-08 11:46:29 65TwinReverbRI<br>We don't usually use the term staccato for this.

At about 2:53 the guitar solo starts and he's playing muted notes which produce a staccato effect and could even be notated as such.

But the part you linked to, the lead guitar is doing a couple of things we can "name".

It's playing "unison notes" which is possible on guitar by playing one note on, in this instance, the open E string, and then a fretted E note on the next adjacent string which gives it sort of that "jangly" sound. That also creates something we call a "drone" or "pedal point" (drone is the more typical word in pop music, especially which it's a high pitch).

The backing chords, we don't really say anything about.

Sometimes we might use a word like "hit" or "stab" for "sharp" rhythms, but usually they are just a one off, or, for example, like the part where all the backing stops and he goes "I'm hot sticky sweet..." right before he starts that there's this "double hit" in the guitars - but most people wouldn't call it that unless trying to describe it to someone who's not hear the song. They're sometimes called things like "stop time" or "stops" or "breaks" and so on.

Mama also has the "drone" idea going on in it too - in that one inner synth line. But there's so much other stuff going on that it's more a backing feature. We don't ave any terms for what every one else is doing (aside from melody, rhythm, etc.) nor the texture as a whole, just "drone" for that one part. The sound being used is "short" and seems to have a break between notes, so we could say it's "staccato" but we don't typically use that term in that way in this kind of context. The "drone" aspect of it is more important and again, that's not even the main part of the texture. 

If you like, they add a "pulsating rhythmic figure droning a single pitch or chord"

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-10 10:43:39 65TwinReverbRI<br>Well, a good place to start is with the "named" pieces of most composers, as they tend to be the more famous ones. If you like the more "plaintive" or "longing" types of pieces, you can look for names like that - Pathetique for example.

But you know, I wouldn't pass up any of the other ones just because they're "happy" names or something :-) It was part of "Romantic Pathos" to write these "brooding" pieces that kind of got associated with Beethoven. But there are some great stories - Haydn has a work called the "Farewell Symphony". The story goes that he and his musicians were at the summer estate of the Prince and were tired of being there and wanted to go home and see their families. So Haydn writes this Symphony where at the end, each of the players gets up one by one and leaves the stage - until only one final player is left - and the music just kind of trails off. Apparently the Prince got the message but you now, in those days that's the kind of revolt that could lose you a head!

Beethoven:

Symphony 3 - Eroica ("heroic" - where he pronounces he's deaf but will overcome it in the "Heilegenstadt Testament", dedicates it to Napoleon, but famously scratches that off after Napoleon invades).

Symphony 5 - just because it's the most famous.

Symphony 6 - Pastoral (was in the original Disney Fantasia 1941)

Symphony 9 - has the famous "ode to joy" at the end.

Pathatique Sonata.

Moonlight Sonata

Waldstein Sonata

Tempest Sonata

Les Adiuex

Appasionata Sonata

Spring Sonata

Emperor Concerto

Archduke Trio

Beethoven's String Quartets start with a style not unlike mature Mozart and Haydn but over the course become incredibly complex and even so adventurous and forward-looking that many have said they either thought he was on the verge of a new musical style much more like the 20th century, or that his deafness was by then so profound that he was just going somewhat crazy with what he was asking of players. The truth is, the Quartet was a vehicle for composers to really push boundaries with, and Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven all did it. But by the end, Beethoven was pushing it pretty extremely. So you kind of need to follow the evolution to get the whole gist of it.

If you're interested in Haydn, there was this period in music called "Sturm und Drang" which translates roughly to "Storm and stress" and was maybe like a little Romantic period before the romantic period! But Haydn lived a long life and composed a lot of great stuff, and his later works are on the same level as Mozart and early Beethoven.

He did 3 early Symphonies that are "Morning, noon and night".

Lamentation Symphony

Farewell Symphony

Surprise Symphony

La Passione Symphony

The Military Symphony

The Clock Symphony (some of these are collected as the "London" symphonies and are the last ones he wrote and all good).

The Joke Quartet

The Lark Quartet

The 5ths Quartet

The Emperor Quartet

The Sunrise Quartet

Haydn is considered "the Father of Classical Music" and really created most of the genres we know - so he is the father of - the String Quartet, the Classical Concerto, the Piano Trio, the Symphony, and the Piano Sonata! (at least, as we know them in their classical forms, some of which were new at the time).

Mozart is worth listening to as well:

Prague Symphony.

Haffner Symphony

Jupiter Symphony

The G Minor Symphony (40)

Many of Mozart's Piano Concertos are well known, but the numbers in the high teens and twenties are very often heard, especially 21

The "Haydn" Quartets - dedicated to his teacher Haydn, and probably the works he spent the most time making worthy of that honor.

The Dissonant Quartet

Mozart wrote Operas, and a lot of them. But some, like the Magic Flute, and Don Giovanni, are the top.m The Marriage of Figaro and Cosi Fan Tutte are worth it.

Also, due to the mythology of Mozart's Requiem, it's worth checking it out.

____

After Beethoven it became more and more common to put names on things - a fad - and even some of them were done by publishers to help sell music (many of the names were added well after the pieces were written by either scholars or publishers, other composers etc. but some composers started naming their own works in attempts at getting them more attention).

But following the pathos vein, Tchaikovsky's "Pathatique" Symphony is not to be missed.

Composers like Mahler are also surrounded in this whole Romantic thing - illnesses, dying young, and so on, so Schubert, Schumann, Mahler, and other composers like that have all this stuff associated with them. Honestly, I'm not crazy about their music but other people are all about it. The Germans get pretty morose and you get "songs of dead children" or "isle of the dead" and stuff like that - some occult influences - some of these were just 20 year olds or younger just getting into the same kinds of rebellious stuff kids today to.

Belioz's Symphony Fantastique with the "March to the Scaffold" is not to be missed :-)

But still the "named" pieces are pretty good rule of thumb - Rhennish Symphony, "Death and the Maiden" Quartet,  but when you get to Wagner and Strauss (Richard) new forms (Tone Poems) start to pop up and while big Symphonies are still being written, by the later 1800s the Romantic period is waning and Impressionism and ultimately Expressionism come in - so Debussy, Ravel, and new forms of music (for example, Ravel and Debussy didn't write any symphonies, and only 1 quartet each - they concentrated on newer forms).

But that should get you started :-)

If you're interested in why some of this stuff is so well regarded, this guy has some excellent videos highlighting some of the "advanced" stuff that not everyone was doing (or capable of doing):

You don't have to worry about that! There is no living in music!!!

OK, seriously, I'll give you my experiences with this.

Firstly, this is very dependent first on YOU, and then second, the program you attend. If the school is renown for placing graduates into careers in the music industry the connections you make with faculty and fellow students could be indispensable - even necessary for getting you into certain types of careers.

But, on the flip side, if what you're interested in doesn't really require a degree, then you'd be getting it solely for your own personal edification.

That of course could also translate to greater success in your field, but most educations are expensive. So there's always that looming over your head.

I'm not familiar with their program, but it actually looks like a perfect fit for you. I'm the area coorinator of a similar program.

You do have to audition to get in. Which means you need to be able to read music, and play well. Here are the requirements:

"PIANO
To be admitted as an undergraduate piano major, students should:

    be able to play all major and minor scales and arpeggios correctly at a moderately rapid tempo;

    have the skills to sight read compositions of moderate difficulty; and
    have already studied such compositions as Bach Inventions, classical sonatas, and works by such composers as Mendelssohn, Chopin, Schumann, Debussy, Bartok, and Kabalevsky.

At the audition, students will be expected to play three pieces of contrasting styles including:

Bach Two or Three Part Invention or suite movement
Movement of a classical sonata
Romantic, Impressionistic, or Twentieth/Twenty-first Century work

They will also be asked to present:

Scales and arpeggios in any major or minor key
Sight reading of an intermediate level work

Students must bring to the audition a Repertoire List including works studied in the past five years."

Our program is similar, though much of our studies are "more traditional" as well. What this means to students is, those interested in a more "popular music" kind of field of study who've sat at home making beats on Fruity Loops are not going to get in. Though you've not studied for 5 years, you should absolutely contact the instrumental faculty and see what they really require. If you can get in if you start taking lessons right now, then I'd start taking lessons right now (I don't know how many people I've told to do this to get into our program and they didn't, and they didn't pass the audition). You need to take that audition as the most serious thing the world.

I've seen tons of older students come in and get a 2nd degree, but very often they are in their 40s, 50s, or even 60s. They're often retired from a career that was a super high-income career so they're set in life, can afford to go back to school, kids are grown, that sort of thing.

If I were to be totally honest about it, I would say cut off the cable, take your phone down to the barest services possible, cut your heat colder in the winter, and AC hotter in the summer. Turn off every unused light in the house. Don't drive anywhere that's absolutely not necessary. Eat Raman Noodles.

Because in reality, it's really all about money. You can buy your way into anything if you have enough money. I know that sounds horrible but this is the world we live in. There's no guarantee that you will get *anything* out of your degree other than self-edification - which is great, but if you don't have the money to be able to put it into use, it's not going to be of any good to you while you're busking on the streets or working with a string of non-profit arts organizations so you can be an "artiste". It's fine if you can pull of the modern Andy Warhol or have built-in charm and charisma and so on, or you're a beautiful person who can use their looks to their advantage and so on (sorry, again, but that's the way it is). Unless you're independently wealthy or can marry rich, saving as absolutely much money as you possibly can and being able to get to where you need to be is probably more effective. If you live in an area that's culturally devoid of anything, then you have to be able to move. If you're locked into mortgages and loans and stuff, that's harder to do.

The one person from our school who's opened up a very successful recording studio did NOT get a music degree. Most famous musicians out there did NOT get music degrees. I was just thinking of two high school friends the other day who did NOT get college degrees but got on-the-job training and have lived comfortably upper middle class lives while me and another of our circle of friends got music degrees and remained involved in a "pop" world of music and have had to live decidedly lower lower middle class lives. On one level, I suppose it's great that we got to "do what we loved" but both of those other guys play in bands and perform locally just like me and the other guy. But they can go out and buy a new drum kit, or put enough gas in the car to get to the gig if they need to.

But who knows - you may "take to it" in that kind of environment too and it may be perfect for you - the people you meet and connections you make could really open up doors for you that you might not have access to in your current situation. And you may end up coming to a love of teaching in the field and there may be opportunities there.

But you need to be good, hard-working, and diligent. You can't be a slouch. You need to be the person that when someone says "we're looking for someone to write for this dance group" you are the one that's recommended. Which means, never late to class, good scores on everything, constant production, and so on. Which may be hard if you're living this dual life of woodworker/teacher elsewhere. So I'm not trying to be discouraging there, but it is something you have to weigh.

_______

Finally, not all programs like this are equal. A couple of decades back, when music technology was exploding and the whole "producer" thing was exploding, schools jumped on the bandwagon and started offering degrees that were often thrown together just to pull up enrollment numbers. It was a "hot" degree area. Some schools have those programs, but don't really have any substance to them - they're for the "I don't know what I want to do with my life but I like music" people who want to be "musicians" but can't play an instrument. Many intentionally appealed to the beatmaker/wannabe producer crowd and simply offered "DAW courses" because kids with no musical background were coming in wanting to be the next Kanye or whoever it was back then and thought if they could learn to use a DAW they could (and some do, but they don't usually major in it!). So they weren't really training anyone for any "real" music industry. By contrast, you look at a program like somewhere like American University, and they're turning out graduates who go on to work in broadcasting at ESPN and things like that - IOW, there's this whole music industry out there people don't know a lot about, and what you're interested in is part of that - sort of the "theatrical/artsy music world" which is fine, and which there's work in, but you've got to make darn sure the school gives you a great background in that and really places people in that area. Because if not, you might be better off to major in Theater or Communications, etc.

Given this program requires the audition, it's going to be a little more "legit" than one that doesn't require any instrument proficiency, but that also sometimes means you may be studying a more traditional musical path, which doesn't work for some people.

_____

Good luck. You sound like you'd really be the type of person who would reap at least some benefit from it, and probably actually do pretty well with it. But, you need to be highly informed before you make that kind of investment. Make sure it's going to work for you in the future. And, don't give up your day job...just yet :-)

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-20 01:20:38 65TwinReverbRI<br>Because the music most guitarists wanted to play necessitated a tuning which allowed them to play both harmony and melody and common musical patterns (chord formations, etc.) at the time.

"Standard Tuning" for Guitar really evolved in the Classical Era and more especially in the Romantic Period when what we now call "Classical Guitar" was more standardized then ever before, as was music for it.

Prior to that, Guitar as we know it stemmed from two primary sources - Spanish Viheula (which closely resembles modern guitar) and the Lute, used in Elizabethan England, France, etc.

There was a time when tunings were not standardized and tuning was varied based on the need of pieces, or which mode pieces were in etc. (other instruments, like Appalachian Dulcimer for example, are modal, and can be tuned to create different modes) and people even made a distinction between "Accords Anciens" (old tuning) and "Accords Nouveaux" (new tuning).

Lute is generally tuned like a modern guitar, in 4ths, with a 3rd between two of the strings. To a modern guitarist, the common Lute tuning looks like a standard guitar tuning with an extra string above the high E (tuned to A). Lutes also had additional low strings that were usually tuned to what we'd now see as, the Low E string, another string for what we'd now consider Drop D, and even lower (and some instruments like Theorbo were similar but with neck extensions for even lower notes that weren't fretted).

A lot of Lute music has been transcribed for guitar, and if we tune or G string down to F#, it gives the same interval structure as the upper strings of Lute so you'll actually still see this in a lot of modern publications for classical guitar. Likewise, you'll run into Drop D transcriptions as well.

Vihuela music also evolved - there were 4 course, and 5 course Vihuelas and even things like "re-entrant" tuning which is more like Ukulele - where a lower string is actually tuned higher.

But over time it got closer and closer to Lute tuning, which both got closer and closer to standard tuning.

In the early Baroque Period (and late Renaissance) Lute read Tabluature, but composers like Bach were writing more complex polyphonic music for it and eventually there was a move towards standard notation. By the Classical Era - and especially into the Romantic Period where music publishing was becoming a major financial industry, it just became necessary for Guitarists to both write in standard notation - so they could sell more music! That's why we see a lot of things like popular opera Arias arranged for guitar or treated as Theme and Variations - guitar composers themselves (Carcassi, Sor, Giuliani, Carulli, etc.) had to be able to read and write standard notation to both stay competitive and make more money selling music!

The other big thing that happens and part of the reason the Lute and Vihulea kind of get replaced by the Guitar is the move from instrumental music in the Renaissance being more of a "lesser" form, to it becoming an equal or even predominant form in the Baroque and especially Classical periods, which also coincided with a move away from Modality into Tonality.

So all the modal tunings sort of gave way to the Major/minor system, which necessitated fewer tunings (and by the time we get well-temperament, we don't need adjustable frets and things like that) and what we now called "standard tuning" was sort of the best compromise to work for the musical system in place.

It does allow for chordal playing. if you compare to Violin, which is tuned in 5ths rather than primarily 4ths, Violins weren't really chordal and used more for playing melodies and individual parts, and because of their size (scale length) and playing angle of the hand, using 4 fingers per string to cover the span of a 5th is quite practical.

Notice that Double Bass by comparison is tuned in 4ths - because the scale length is so much greater it has to have fewer notes in one position before moving to another string.

While Lute scale lengths (and older Viheulas) were shorter, they weren't really as short ad violins and playing higher led to tuning issues, so more strings with less distance between them worked better - and allowed for chords.

So by the time all these factors come together, the "Classical" guitar became standardized with what we now call standard tuning, with exceptions here and there (there are even Dropped D and Dropped G (A string tuned down as well) pieces).

In the later 19th century, when music for guitar was becoming ever more demanding (Paganini, many of the later guitar Virtuosi) tuning started to get changed for fuller sound, and we even see in the 20th century guitarists using 7 and 8 or more stringed guitar to enable them to play transcriptions from Romantic Period piano works, or orchestral works, or to be able to compose for guitar that way. And in the 20th century, people got even more experimental.

Many guitarists coming from a pop music perspective today may learn about Drop D, DADGAD, open tunings, or 7 string guitars for example, but none of this is new. It's actually ancient at this point!

But, basically what happened was that in the "Common Practice Period" which includes Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods, as well as popular music in the 20th century, had so much music written for standard tuning on Guitar, and so much music could be easily transcribed to standard tuning (even earlier music!) that it became the "default" tuning that allowed players to play the most amount of music with the least amount of hassle.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-20 07:43:18 beaumega1<br>If you only want to use the diatonic notes of C, you have seven simple chords at your disposal. You can build a triad (stack of 3 notes) from each of the notes in C.

CEG, DFA, EGB, FAC, GBD, ACE, BDF

If you prefer using Roman numerals, this looks like:

I - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - vii° (where uppercase indicates a major chord, lowercase indicates a minor chord, and ' ° ' indicates a diminished chord)

To keep it really basic, you can try some variations with the pattern: pre-dominant &gt; dominant &gt; tonic

Common pre-dominant options are ii and IV, but vi is also a possibility.

Your dominant options will be V and vii°

And your most common tonic chord will obviously be I, but vi is another good choice. So if you grab some random choices and string them together, you get some options for progressions:

ii &gt; V &gt; I (Dm &gt; G &gt; C)

IV &gt; vii° &gt; I (F &gt; B° &gt; C)

IV &gt; V &gt; vi (F &gt; G &gt; Am)

vi &gt; V &gt; I (Am &gt; G &gt; C)

From there, you can add another third to each chord, giving you "seventh chords":

I(M7) &gt; ii7 &gt; iii7 &gt; IV(M7) &gt; V7 &gt; vi7 &gt; viiø7

You can pop these into the same pattern as above to get other possible progressions. If you want some 4-chord progressions, try "pre-dom &gt; pre-dom &gt; dom &gt; tonic", or "tonic &gt; pre-dom &gt; dom &gt; tonic", or similar variations.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-21 13:11:06 lasercruster<br>I've taken a look at your post history and I think you have two major misunderstandings about music theory.  


1. You don't seem to grasp the concept and meaning of "tonality" or a "tonal center". The idea that there is a home base from which all other tones or chords gain their context. Yes, it's true that A Minor Pentatonic and C Major Pentatonic both share the exact same notes...But that doesn't mean they're functionally "the same thing" and are interchangeable. They're distinct in that they have a different home base: A for Am, and C for CMaj. In the same way, C Ionian and E Phrygian share the exact same notes, but the distinct Phrygian only comes out if your tonality, your home base, is E.  
"Happy Birthday" in C Major has notes that are technically in E Phrygian - but it makes \*zero\* sense to say that "Happy Birthday" is in E Phrygian, because E is not the tonal center.   

2. Related closely to the above: Scales and modes are not just 'positions and patterns on the guitar'. The whole "Dorian" exists in the first place, isn't just so you can start your shred run on the second note of a major scale. It's its own distinct tonality, with a 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, 6, and b7. Miles Davis and Carlos Santana take solos using the Dorian mode, but you won't hear it in Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love". Because it's not the same thing as Mixolydian, or Minor Pentatonic, or Blues.   


This fundamental misunderstanding, I think, is why so much of your lead guitar playing sounds the exact same. You're just playing comfortable licks, all in the same tonality, with little care. Can you actually sing what you're playing, as you play it? Do you think about melody at all? Or is it just patterns?  


 \&gt; However, on the guitar, you HAVE to think G Mixolydian because the guitar works in 3’s. Each mode is 3 notes per string, with unique half and whole step intervals depending on the mode. So to play anything at all in the key of C/F, you need to have a 3NPS pattern memorized, or 2 NPS if you want to be pentatonic.   


You \*can\* play a Mixolydian scale using three notes per string, but you absolutely don't have to. You can play a scale staying on one string up the neck. You could play two notes per string. **You don't even have to play a scale, just ascending and descending by step**. The patterns and shapes you learned somewhere on Youtube aren't "\*the\* way to play scales", they're just convenience positions for your hand. The guitar has all the same notes as a piano or saxophone, so the methods for playing melodies and scales apply equally. Only the fingering is different.  


\&gt;  On the piano, you just play whatever.   


I can't emphasize enough how backward this is. You can play whatever the hell you want on a guitar, too. Having six  (or seven) strings to play on doesn't box you in to playing these cookie-cutter licks and runs. The same music theory applies.  


\&gt;  There’s nothing wrong with my Have You Met Miss Jones cover that I posted. I can play it however I want. It’s jazz.   


You absolutely can play it however you want. But it should be clear to you that your rhythm in this recording isn't standard or common in any era of jazz. You're playing chords like you're strumming a pop song on a ukulele. \*Which is fine\*! But it's not in the jazz style.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-23 06:47:38 65TwinReverbRI<br>u/billybrowntrombone, trying to cut through the noise here :-)

So, Classical Music - which is likely what you're studying in Theory, is different from a lot of other styles. There are many styles that are either descending from this "CPP" music (Common Practice Period) and certainly some of those elements are still in use in many styles and may even be prevalent.

But, to explain maybe a little more deeply:

The progression "up a 4th" or "Root Movement of a 4th" is considered the strongest Functional progression because it allows the Dominant to resolve to the Tonic. It also very quickly helps us establish keys because it makes unique progressions that can't be duplicated in other keys, so things like ii - V, and vi - ii also exhibit this property.

However, maybe a better way to say it (and the way it is often said) is to refer to those functions - Tonic, Dominant, and Subdominant (or Pre-Dominant, or Dominant Prep, etc.) and then authors don't agree on the others, but one word is "Mediant" or another is "Variable".

What CPP music does is use Functional Harmony to imply and establish a Tonal Center (Key) through use of SD to D to T progressions. This could be ii - V - I (and frequently is).

ii could be replaced by IV, and V could be replaced by vii^o (and notice IV to vii^o is also root movement of a 4th).

But, IV - V - I also does well to establish tonality and is functional - being SD-D-T, but one of them is not a 4ths progression.

Secondary Dominant chords are actually also the same as a V(7) - I resolution, and thus a 4ths progression too. But, Secondary Leading Tone chords can be (and often are) used similarly.

N6 goes to V - which some people see N as a modified II, but others see it as a special type of chord.

So we could say that the Cycle of 4ths progressions are part of the structural underpinning of Functional Progression and Tonal Harmony, but, in that they exhibit the SD-D-T functional progression, not "Just" that they're a 4th apart (because as we can see, there are other possible moves with similar function).

iii is actually a very rare chord in Major keys. If you were to tally up the number of chords in every piece during the CPP, you'd probably see I, or maybe even V(7) at the top of the list. ii and maybe IV, then vi and vii^o are probably next. iii would be way down on the list. In fact, you'll probably see more Neapolitans and way more Secondary chords before you see a iii! In fact, you're probably even more likely to modulate to a new key and use a bunch of non-iii chords in that key before you'll see a iii in the primary key !!!

I have my book of Bach Chorales here and the progression for the first one goes:

I - I - IV - V - I - I - V - vi - IV - vii^o - I - V

So, my point to you in my original response is, look at this. It's not your typical pop music - I - V - vi - IV progression. There's one in there, but it's not a 4 chord loop like so much pop music. It's not just slamming a 7th, 9th, or alteration on there to make it "more interesting" or "more unique" and so on. It doesn't even have any significant Cycle progressions - IV to vii^o is one. So is V to I. I to IV is not usually considered one because I is treated specially, but it's not a iii going to vi, and a vi going to ii and so on.

Where the "interest" comes in - and this is part of my original point - is which chords are used when and how they work with the melody, and which chords are inverted (for example the first IV and V are which is different from root position) and so on.

So it's more about making the harmony serve the melody, and in doing so, creating interest and variety through inversion and chord choice (also, in Chorale, there's the addition of non-chord tones, though rhythm is pretty straightforward in that style).

But, there is also a general move and smaller moves from SD-D-T.

T - T - **SD - D - T** - T - *D - fake tonic* - **SD - D - T** and this ends on a half cadence to set up the next phrase.

There are types of analysis which also reduce phrases like this to show a more basic structure, where the first part is all sort of an elaboration of the Tonic function (the IV and V being weak because they're inverted) and the "real" move being IV - vii^o - I and so on (I'm not saying that's exactly what it is here, but that's how it often works) which is a "deeper level - SD - D - T move.

So actually, that kind of analysis is used in "more complex" pieces that don't follow the more obvious path or where function is more obscured. But generally, we like to talk about it in terms of function rather than specific chord numerals all the time.
____

Now, popular music is different and is even more likely to not only not use any Cycle of 4ths progressions, but not use functional harmony either - some are "anti-functional" on purpose, or do what we call a "retrogression", which is going "backwards" - DOWN a 4th instead of up a 4th! So it's like going - T - D - SD - T for your pieces - the wrong way! But we accept it because we like the way it sounds too.

_____


I keep saying "4ths" and "Cycle" because really, the "Circle of 5ths" isn't at all about progressions. It's about Keys. Period. But obviously because it's organized in 5ths many people make the connection. I prefer "Cycle of 4ths" or just "Root Movement of a 4th" because it ties in with what you use for voice-leading principles and so on. But some people don't care to make such a distinction.

____

And finally, I was just trying intentionally throw you some curveballs to get you to think about this stuff - too bad others reacted so counter, but it's a very common problem we see - people trying to make chord progressions "more hip" or "more complex" and so on. There can certainly be reasons to do so, but if you think about it, a common Jazz misconception is to just put say an alteration or higher extension on the chords. But the problem is, that becomes a cliche itself and then isn't really any more complex.

It's more about what chord you use when - or when you don't. Sometimes a well placed triad in the middle of some 7th chords, or a well placed secondary in the middle of a diatonic progression, can say far more than just making a string of secondaries (in a "circle of 5ths progression"!) That's fine in a sequence on as part of a development section or something, but it can seem over-bearing and tend to wander or have *too much** direction/thrust in a phrase - sometimes, composers just want it to be all about I, or all about I and V, and so on.

So don't get too caught up in always trying to make the progression the main focus of a piece. It's OK for it to be "boring" if your melody makes up for it. It's even better to learn to use inversions creatively (which most pop music doesn't even touch on).

These are the kinds of things you're likely studying in theory class - but sometimes it's a little hard to see the forest for the trees. So take a step back, look at the forest, the trees, the leaves, the limbs, the roots, and everything because music is really about the big picture and overall effect of the piece - sometimes it could be a forest, but sometimes it could just be a single giant old oak tree in a pasture that's so beautiful on its own.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-01 04:39:13 MrRedTRex<br>Yeah. I do this also. If you're in Emajor and play an open Emaj chord, you can keep your pointer and middle finger where they are the entire time and move your pinky to make the rest of the chords. I'm not sure of the actual names in this case, but you can move pinky to F# note and play an F#chord, move to G#, move to C# and move to B. Then you just remove your ring finger from the A string and keep the rest, and there's the A. And voila, you have basically that entire scale. 

I learned this from being in a pop/indie/punk band in the early 00's. Most Taking Back Sunday songs off the original record are played this way. A lot of Kevin Devine's stuff also. it's a really fun and simple way to play in that key.

In this context probably going to sound like Dadd9add11.

Common guitar chord actually - move the C shape up.

Thumb? I think you mean the FIFTH string :-)

Even though the C is not present, we'd usually call it a #11 instead. 

Fadd9(#11) or Fadd9(add#11)

It would be b13. Could be Fmaj7(#11)/A but depends on the context if it's A rooted or F rooted (since there were some F chords before) but probably A rooted.

Typo on your notes.  A-E-G#-C-E - but yes AmM7

Fmaj13(#11) or (see below) Cmaj9/F

_____

Ok so let's clear up a couple of things.

Firstly, chord names are just "harmony" names, not **specific**.

A chord with "13" in the name doesn't and really isn't intended to tell you if the 9th and/or 11th is included.

Secondly, when a 7th is present, it's 9, 11, or 13, and when the 7th is not present, it's "add9" or "add11".

Thirdly we don't usually use "add2" or "add4" (though some pop sources do) and instead call them "add9" etc. even if the added note is low in the chord.

Finally, naming chords is kind of a stupid exercise :-)

If you want people to play specific voicings, you need to write it out as standard notation, or for guitar, tablature or chord diagrams. Chord Symbols (names) are not intended for this.

Think about it this way, if I put "C", a player could play that any number of ways. Same with G13(#11) - they could play it a number of ways. It's totally up to them - just because it has more notes or "numbers" in the chord name doesn't mean you get to specify any more :-)

So there's no way to name some of these that a guitarist would play them that way. You have to notate it, or tab it out, etc. There's no point in even naming the chords aside from maybe telling people who can't read tab what they are (which is why guitarists need to learn to read standard notation) or as just a practice exercise for you to learn how to do it.

So what this means and why I spelled it out like I did above, you can't really put "add9add11add13"! (add13 doesn't really even exist).

You can get away with stuff like "add9(#11)" because putting the #11 means to include it - but because it's altered. But if it were plain 11 it would probably be "add9add11" which again gets cumbersome.

One way around this is to look for alternate bass names so for example your 7th to last chord could simply be C/F. It's much more compact than Fmaj7sus2.

Hopefully you can see that the system is just not designed to name these rather complex non-tertian "added note" style chords. It can, but it produces rather cumbersome names that really don't mean any more than "Am7", which again, could be played any number of ways.

____

You're not doing it wrong at all and this is actually very typical guitar playing - including open strings within other chord shapes to create harmonically rich chords that give us weird names.

And your naming for the most part is good. Your errors with the tougher ones stem more from the difference between 2, 4, and 6, and 9, 11, and 13 and just some typos.

So really good job!

But, please do yourself a lifelong favor and learn to use standard music notation if you don't already know how to do so - and while published music would certainly name the chords in a standard notation with tab with chord diagrams format, don't try to worry about voicings with the names - just use them as a general reference - an "after the fact name" that is the "one that is clearest" without using it to play from or anything like that.

This comment accomplishes nothing but to stroke your ego as the person writing it, and you've made a baseless claim that is completely false by saying:

&gt; The harmonic series is not a series of fractions. It's also not really "what music is based of of."

Both of these statements are simply false. The harmonic series is a series of fractions, and is the basis for the diatonic scale which is the basis for virtually all of western music: classical, jazz, pop, punk, metal, rock - every genre that uses major or minor scales, or even the less common modes, is based on the diatonic scale which is based on the harmonic series. It's not just a western music thing either: non-diatonic scales from other cultures are also pulled from the harmonic series in other ways. 

But really, it's even more fundamental than that: when a string, vocal chord, reed, lip, etc vibrates it creates vibration at the fundamental frequency as well as the upper harmonics at 2x, 3x, 4x etc that frequency. 

It's a physical phenomena of sound, so to claim that is inaccurate to say it is "what music is based on" shows a great ignorance about the subject, which combined with your childish desire to tell OP he is wrong creates a toxic combination that really should not be encouraged or supported with up-votes. You're just being an ass.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-26 09:21:57 65TwinReverbRI<br>The logic exists in the same places it does for Violin - in the musical style, and the restrictions of the instrument.

You can play Quadruple stops, but you can't play every single voicing can you?

Guitar is the same way.

We can play chords in numbers of different ways, but there are definitely more common ones and more stylistically common ones.

Likewise, there are no rules - we do it based on the sound we want to achieve - and again the limitations come in the form of what is physically possible on the instrument, what one's knowledge about making chords on the instrument is, and to some degree, if one feels it appropriate, what is common or not common in the style.

I could absolutely voice an E chord with the low E string open, the B string open, and the G# on the 16th fret on the high E string.

But it's probably not going to be all that practical, especially for playing music that you want to "sound like" the music others - let's say, The Beatles, have made.

Really, the answer is to learn guitar - and learn actual real parts from actual real songs to see what they do.

We play a lot of Cowboy Chords (Open Chords), Barre Chords, and other Moveable shapes and Partial chords.

But a lot of guitar players - and a lot of pop songs - never use anything beyond Cowboy chords.

We can say this about guitar:

Voicing in 3rds is difficult except primarily in partial chords, and especially for 7th and higher structures. So "close position" voicings are unidiomatic in general - many are possible, but it is not typically the guitarist's bread and butter.

Open voicings, or a mix of open and close voicings are more common and more idiomatic - they fall under the fingers more easily. This is why you'll often see Jazz tutorials about Drop 2 voicings and so on (though that's only one approach).

The Open Position chords are voiced like so, low to high:

E - B - E - G# - B - E

G - B - D - G - B - G or C - B - D - B - D - G

A - E - A - C# - E

C - E - G - C - E

D - A - D - F#

It is possible on those 4 and 5 string versions to play additional lower notes, especially if they're open strings (E and A).

It's also possible to "skip strings" or otherwise deaden them - for example, it's quite common to play G as G - (B) - D - G -B - G so the low 3rd is not in the chord (can sound muddy in some contexts).

Other chords are possible to play, but some are more difficult. The minor, 7, and minor 7 versions of E, A, and D are all well within reach, and in some cases a finger gets freed up to make different voicings.

But some chords, such as B7, are really only possible in one way:

B - D# - A - B - F#

It's not really practical or easy to play any alternate voicings of that chord in that position. Likewise, C7 is generally:

C - E - Bb - C - E

It would be possible to do

Bb - E - G - C - E but it's not really common or again, easy to get to and make sound good (though certainly with practice, could be executed well).

Any F, F#, G#, Bb, C#, and Eb chords are really unidiomatic for this position. They all involve fretting all the strings in most cases so are not considered "open" position chords or, if you can make an open string, it puts it in inversion, or is otherwise in a hard place to get to.

For example, Bb Major would require (F) - Bb - D - Bb - D - F but the problem is it's really hard to hold the low Bb and have the D string open, then cover the remaining notes which all also have to be fretted. Again, unidiomatic.

You can look up some open position chords and hopefully find one with pitches listed too, and see what is common.

To see what's possible, in general, we can look at Barre Chords, and Moveable forms.

Barre chords essentially replace the open string with a fretted note. E major is this:

0

0

1

2

2

0

This takes 3 fingers for the 3 fretted notes, and then we can just play the other strings open (lowest sounding string on the bottom - so this is  E - B - E - G# - B - E )

We can "barre" with our First Finger, which means to cover all 6 strings (there are also partial barres covering some subset of 2-5 strings as well, with 2 and 3 being more common). If we do so, we can "move up" all the notes, so to play an F chord, we could do this:

1

1

2

3

3

1

Notice that they're all just 1 higher than before. This is F. If we want F#, we just move them all up another fret. We can actually play every single major chord this way!

With all 6 strings barred like this, it becomes a "moveable" form, we can simply move up and down the neck,

So any voicing of a major chord of R-5-R-3-5-R is ok. You just don't want to have to jump from F to Eb as it involves a 10 fret jump.

We can also reach the following forms very easily from there:

Minor - R-5-R-b3-5-R

7 - R-5-b77-3-5-R

m7-R-5-b7-b3-5-R

Major 7 is possible, but rarely used because of the m9 interval between the M7 note and the first string Root, but you could just not play the 1st string.

We call these an "E Form" because they are based on the E Open position voicing (shape) and we also call them a "6th string form" because the root of the chord is on the 6th string.

There are 5th string shapes based on the A open chord, which is A-E-A-C#-E and played like:

0

2

2

2

0

(0) - this note being an E, and optional, but since the root of the chord is on the 5th string, we usually write them this way to emphasize the root and the form to differentiate it from the 6th string version).

This is

R-5-R-3-5

Other easy forms are

Maj7 - R-5-7-3-5

7 - R-5-b7-3-5

m - R-5-R-b3-5

m7 - R-5-b7-b3-5

Again, we can barre these chords up - add 1 fret or more to all the notes, so a Bbm chord would be:

1

2

3

3

1

(1) and still R-5-R-b3-5

The major form, with 3 notes on the same fret, is actually kind of hard for a lot of people and a lot of people "cheat" in some way - either not playing the top string, or using strange fingerings - the latter can still produce the right voicing but some players prefer to play the Major form on the 6th string forms, and the Maj7 on the 5th string forms, because those are the 2 that are easier to get to on those string sets - the rest are equally easy.

"Moveable" forms include barre chords, but there are also ones that aren't barres. Some can be moveable or made into barres or quasi barres, but it depends on the players finger reach and so on.

But, C7 is the classic moveable form - it's R-3-b7-R on strings 5-2 like so:

x (could be played, but ignored for this)

1

3

2

3

x

Since all the strings are fretted, all one has to do is move the shape up the neck.

You want D7? it's now

x

3

5

4

5

x

Lots of shapes are like this.

But what this means is, Major and Minor triads on the upper 3 strings, and strings 2-3-4 are quite common, as you can make close position triads. If you look at the upper 3 notes of the 6th string E form, it's G#-B-E. the minor form is G-B-E (first 3 strings open). This means you can move that shape up to make ANY major or minor triad in first inversion in close position.

The D chord's upper 3 strings (C chord as well) produce major and minor 2nd inversion shapes that can be moved up to play any chord, and the A chord shape produces a root position form that operates the same.

The same principle happens on the 2-3-4 string sets, based on the E chord, A chord, and C chord.

You can do these shapes - which happen to be subsets of the full barre chord, on strings 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, 1-2-3-4, and 2-3-4-5! As long as the 3rd of the chord is on one of the strings in the subset, the other notes on either side of it (one or two strings distant) will be the root and 5th, so voicings like:

C-E-G; E-G-C; G-C-E

and

C-E-G-C;-E-G-C-E and G-C-E-G are all possible and common (though minor 1st inversion is less common and often more like an Eb6 form rather than Cm/Eb).

Because the C and D shapes, and the G and A shapes are closely related, this gives us 5 forms that can really get you a LOT of mileage on guitar. Because of this, many use a system they call C-A-G-E-D which uses various Barre and Moveable shapes based on these open forms (the most common ones, and ones mentioned earlier above).

You might want to google a "Chord Encyclopedia" as they usually have plenty - and more you'd probably never use, but the best thing to do is put your hands on the guitar and figure out where the notes are and maybe learn to play a bit! Obviously it will help to learn real parts from real songs, rather than arrangements.

So I hope that gets you started. There's obviously a lot more to this, and I didn't really go into 7ths and 9ths, but playing 6 note chords of R-3-5-7-9-11 are not possible and the voicing has to be restructured and usually, certian notes omitted. The common 9th chord form is R-3-b7-9 but other voicings involve some pretzel fingerings sometimes. Luckily like violin, we usually have other instruments filling out harmonies, or carrying a bass note, so we can usually leave out stuff for "higher tension" chords to no ill effect.

B Major.

With the given info, yes, that's correct.

As logan said, more context is really needed though.

this could be E Lydian.

But it's also only the chorus.

Key of SONG is not really determined by just one section.

The rest of the song could in fact begin and/or end on I and it just doesn't in this section. We don't know because you didn't tell us!

But, songs don't have to begin or end on I, they just need to emphasize it in some way - and the melody and bass line could be a big part of that, which we also don't have.

IOW, Key, or Mode, is more than just a string of chords.

But in pop/rock you should kind of start with the assumption that something is Major or Minor, and once you've ruled those out you can move to other things. If there's nothing to really rule it out, then Major or minor is pretty typical and so common that it's often your best choice.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-09 08:50:35 algorithmoose<br>My band teacher would sometimes ask for suggestions or give us multiple choice, especially for the pops concert (soundtrack, musical theater, etc.) since it was less "serious". There were times when he'd introduce a handful of new pieces and if no one liked one we'd drop it. These were special cases and most of the music was picked by him. I suspect a lot of this had to do with competitions, cost (a lot of newer stuff you have to pay a bunch for while public domain stuff is much nicer on the budget), and curriculum. It's also potential conflict trying to get your 60 students to agree on something.

Small group/section lessons were required. Etudes and duo/trio/quartet things were assigned, but you also got to pick solo pieces fairly regularly. Competition solos (optional) were selected from a list from the state music thing based on difficulty, but the list was fairly big so you could pick your style or period pretty well.

Extra-curricular groups also had more student choices than band/orchestra. Jazz groups were more similar to the large groups, but we had flute ensemble, sax ensemble, string quartets, jazz trio, and a bunch of things that were student-created (usually with moderate teacher involvement) which showed up in our usual concerts. We had a christmas concert where anyone could audition so you get these groups popping up and even some guitar, pop covers, and otherwise uncommon musical genres in music education showing up.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-15 05:59:59 GlennMagusHarvey<br>My thoughts:

Classical:

* Use of V-I (and V-i) cadences.  (minor) v and bVII (the subtonic) are rare chords except in sequences and modulations.  IV-I or ii-I cadences (or their minor analogues) are rare, and mainly reserved for works evoking a religious atmosphere (cf. calling the IV-I cadence the "Amen cadence").
* Pieces often start and end in the same key, and on the tonic chord.  Modulations usually only to nearby keys.
* Strong mood contrasts between major and minor.
* Instrumentation: (almost) exclusively acoustic instruments.  Percussion is rare outside of orchestral works.  Very common use of bowed strings.
* Many instrumental works.
* Use of *tempo rubato* in some works.
* Straight rhythms -- i.e. not swung.
* Duple/quadruple time most common, but triple time is also frequent, particularly in dance-derived forms.  Occasional irregular time signatures.  Simple time more common but compound time amply represented.
* A variety of musical forms characteristic of classical music -- e.g. sonata-first-movement form, dance-and-trio, etc..
* Multi-movement works, lasting up to an hour or more.  Movements vary in length but can easily be around 10 minutes long.
* Strong focus on composer.

Jazz:

* Rich harmonic style, frequently using seventh chords, ninth chords, altered chords, added notes, etc..
* Flat fifth, flat seventh, and flat third common within major key writing.
* Common (though not ubiquitous) use of the 12-bar blues progression.
* Very common (though not ubiquitous) use of swing rhythms.
* Duple/quadruple time most common but some triple and irregular time signatures are sometimes represented.
* In score-writing, simple time signatures are often used to imply swung rhythms.
* Instrumentation often includes brass (and maybe reedy woodwinds), backed by piano, string bass (almost always plucked), and drum set.
* In a multi-instrument work, each instrument often gets its own "solo" section, where it is only lightly accompanied by the rest of the ensemble, and given a chance to show off via improvisation.  It seems customary to applaud after each such section.
* Improvisation is common, often chromatic, often using what might be traditionally considered non-chord tones.

Pop:

* Simple harmonic style, commonly (though not ubiquitously) using a repeated four-chord progression for extensive portions of a song.  I V vi IV is a common choice for such a progression.  Many pieces end on a non-tonic chord.
* Use of "power chords", i.e. open fifths, as harmony.
* Strong focus on a prominent melody, played straight.
* Almost always has a vocal part.  If so, almost always in song form -- typically verse 1, refrain, verse 2, refrain, mainly instrumental bridge, optional verse 3, refrain, with optional connecting/intro/outtro material.
* Common instrumentation: solo vocalist(s), one or more guitars, electronic keyboard, drums.  Guitars may be acoustic or (more commonly) electric (i.e. amplified).  Drum set is almost omnipresent, except in some slower songs.
* Swing rhythms less common than in jazz, but more common than in classical.
* Almost always duple/quadruple time, and almost always simple rather than compound.  Triple time occasionally represented.
* No *tempo rubato* and generally constant tempo.
* Tonality can change to distant keys using techniques uncommon in classical, such as the "truck driver's gear change" where something is shifted up a half or whole step, often at the end of a song.
* Each piece usually lasts less than 6 minutes.
* Pieces organized into albums of around an hour or longer.
* Strong focus on performer, even if performer is not the composer.

Of the 312 ways he says they can be notated, I've seen about 3 or 4 commonly!

Let's make it simple:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/halleonard-closerlook/00138161/00138161p05z.jpg

(this is more typical modern pop notation, not classical but people use it for classical now commonly too)

Use a diamond-shaped notehead at the sounding pitch you want.

If necessary, indicate the string and fret it is to be played on as well.

Strings are typically given as arabic numerals in a circle.

Frets traditionally are done as roman numerals but in modern guitar music where there's likely to be harmonics played (and notes!) above the 12th fret on all strings, the common practice is just to put "19th" or something similar.

If necessary "harm." could be included, especially with a bracket that extends over the notes to be played this way.

Though honestly, the diamond-shaped notehead is enough.

I think the diamond shape with the little "o" is total overkill and not something I've ever seen that I can recall. Usually it's a standard notehead with the little "o", or the diamond-shaped notehead, not both.

But "harm." may or may not be included. I was writing something where I used a diamond-shaped notehead to play at the same time as regular notes and the harmonic notehead just got lost in the score visually - it looked too much like a whole note since it was hollow - so I added "harm." and the string and fret numbers (which were needed in this case) so it's pretty darn clear!

For the RH harmonics (or Artificial Harmonics, or Pinch Harmonics), you do the same thing and just notate "R.H. harm." but the common thing to do is to write the FRETTED NOTE as a regular note, then the diamond-shaped notehead above at the SOUNDING HARMONIC pitch (stemmed together). Again, the fret and string numbers can be included as necessary (sometimes it's obvious from what fretted notes had to be played, etc.).

So the player sees you play an A note on the 6th string, then it has an A diamond-shaped notehead an octave up, and you put "RH Harm." so the player will fret the low A and and produce a harmonic that sounds an 8ve higher (12 frets higher).

_______

I would avoid the "old" system where the STRING's OPEN NOTE is written and then use the numerals to indicate fret.

If you want a B harmonic on the open E string at the 7th fret, you'd put an E top space with the little circle, then "harm. VII".

As the website u/Jongtr linked to shows, this can make the melodic line confusing (that Villa-Lobos example he goes into detail about is one of the more commonly cited problematic passages).

I'd only use the note with a circle over it for simple 12 fret open string harmonics where it's obvious in a rather simple piece. (I don't like to intermix notation within a piece though).

Showing the SOUNDING pitch the harmonics make always makes the melodic line or desired pitch far more obvious.

Another common one is to put the SOUNDING note (standard notehead) with the little harmonic symbol "o". This is confusing with the other system and why so much confusion abounds. The 12th fret harmonic on the high E would not be written in top space with the "o", but 3 ledger lines above the staff with the little "o"!

So you have to figure out a lot of these things by context - which method a given publisher is using.

Part of the confusion is that for many other instruments, when the little "o" was used it was always assumed to be just an octave overtone as that was the most common one.

I'd recommend looking at some classical guitar music scores, and then some modern "tablature-with-staff" style scores and see how they approach it.

One thing you can always do though is put a little performance note at the beginning of your piece, "all harmonics indicated at sounding pitch" or something of that nature.

And I am definitely planning to do some orchestration with my group, probably approach it through arranging for some ensemble at the school. Something like: “Start with a pop melody you like and create a compelling string quartet.”

If nothing else, I want my students to get a taste, and to realize there is a big world of music outside of the high school and AP context.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-18 09:55:11 jimjambanx<br>First learn the basic major scale in all positions on the neck. It honestly doesn't matter what system you use, be it CAGED, 3NPS or some sort of hybrid (I'm a 3NPS player, but occasionally think in CAGED), both are a means to the same end. There's been a long, drawn out debate on what system is superior and why you shouldn't learn the other, I think it's all a load of crap, both have their advantages and disadvantages, and as long as you consistently work at it you can make any system work. I'd say for rock, metal and fusion try 3NPS; for pop, jazz and country, go CAGED.

From there, learn your triads, all inversions up and down the neck, on each set of 3 adjacent strings. I'd then move on to arpeggios, with roots on the E, A and maybe D string (eg you should be able to play all inversions of a G major arpeggio, starting on the E A or D string). At that point you should be comfortable enough with the fretboard that you'll know what you need to work on.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-28 06:32:11 65TwinReverbRI<br>Think of them in terms of Language. A phrase is a sentence, or a phrase, or a clause, etc. A cadence is like punctuation.

Probably the first taught kind of phrases are those in an Antecedent and Consequent relationship, because they work very much like a Question and Answer pair:

"Would you like to have some dinner?

"Yes, that would be great."

So the question sort of "demands an answer".

In the same way, an Antecedent Phrase demands continuation.

Usually, this kind of phrase ends with a "less conclusive" cadence or even one that is much like a "question" - a Half Cadence, for example, which demands resolution.

So a musical Phrase might be defined (and has been) as a complete musical idea, terminated by a cadence.

Here's a simple example - Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville:

Nibblin on sponge cake, watching the sun bake, all of those tourists covered in oil.

Strumming my six string, on my front porch swing, smell those shrimp they're beginning to boil.

So the whole phrase is "complete" when oil is rhymed with boil. But, this "paragraph" (or Stanza in poetry) is comprised of TWO phrases as I laid them out here. 

Musically - or harmonically - the first phrase is all a I chord until it gets to "oil" where it changes to the V - a half cadence, that demands continuation.

Then it stays on V and finally resolves to I on the word "boil". 

The ending on I is essentially an "answer to the question". The first line kind of sets up the scene, and the second line kind of completes the picture. It can also work with "call and response" type figures in music.

Together, the Antecedent and Consequent Phrases comprise what is called a "Period". If musically they both begin the same way, it's called a "Parallel Period", if not, it's a "Contrasting Period".

____

Now just by way of contrast, you'll notice the lyrics in that song go "stumming my six sting, on my front porch swing - now, that's a rhyme, so you might think, well isn't that a pair of phrases? But harmonically speaking, it's all the same chord - nothing happens, so it can't be a cadence.

_____


Modern popular music is a bit trickier. You often have 4 measure loops with no real sense of cadence harmonically - or it's a cadence every time around if you want to look at it that way. But the LYRICS become the determining factor there.

______


Now, there are all kinds of Phrases, and all kinds of Cadences, but  - there are also all kinds of Periods - there are Double Periods, there are things called Phrase Groups, or Three-Phrase Periods and so on, as well as just stand alone phrases.

But you are looking for a comparatively "complete" musical idea terminated by a cadence.

FWIW, phrases are usually 4 to 8 measures, and some people call other things like 2 measures "sub phrases".

But it probably helps to learn them in "more obvious situations" than all the exceptions.

It would really help to learn the standard definitions in Classical Music first, as pop really almost evades cadences in many ways - or they're highly modified, or we need a new conceptual understanding of what's going on.

I think this video might help you out:

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-29 11:43:33 65TwinReverbRI<br>We'd probably have to take a survey of a lot of pieces.

The V is just historically the most common - very typical old cadence and we still hear that a lot (or V7sus4 as well).

It also depends on how strongly you want to call those patterns where say, A B C D E up and down are played more melodically over an Am chord - they produce sus2 and sus4 chords along the way, and it's a super common keyboard player thing, but they also tend to get conflated in 9 and 11 (or add 9 and 11, etc.) structures. I'm talking here where they're more specifically "chordal" than melodic, but really a chord with a moving note so typical in keyboard playing (in a lot of pop songs). We do it in guitar a lot too and certainly most guitarists are no strangers to having the open E and then the G on the E string in combination with the Dm, and the same with B and D on the 2nd string with Am - though I'd say that major is probably more common on average, it's not like they don't happen in minor.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-29 20:51:04 bmarkovic<br>Hijaz would actually map pretty well to western Phrygian Dominant as a mode of Pythagorean Ionian, and thus *almost* perfectly to 12TET E Phrygian with major third. 

This is, I believe, why it's commonly used in  middle-eastern pop music. It's easy for players of eastern instruments such as Ney, Oud or Baglama to play idiomatically while being in tune with Guitars which are tuned to 12TET and cannot be detuned due to fixed frets OTOH, synths (depending on whether internal software supports microtuning) and fretless string instruments can all be adapted or retuned to match most maqams, and even a piano can be tuned as desired albeit not between songs in a live performance as the process is time consuming.

The "sad" scales are almost universally derived from Dorian. All middle eastern scales stem from the same tetrachord traditions (arguably Sumeran) as the Greek scales - so they actually share scholastic ancestry with western scales. Turkish makam traditions are even obviously influenced by Greek church chorale, and Balkan even more so. A lot of these scales and makams map to 12TET with similar fidelity as the original church modes do. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-01-04 11:27:21 Scatcycle<br>The first point isn't an assumption, it's a documented phenomenon.  The notes of a perfect fifth share such a closely related set of overtones that movement of parallel fifths removes the sensation of multiple voices. It's a bit like how you don't hear 20 voices (the overtones) moving within a melody, you just hear one. This is the same with octaves. Even thirds, if consistently parallel, will be perceived as one voice. 


I think we agree in that we both think the merit of voice leading is questionable in popular modern music. While I think that good voice leading is inherently pleasing to the ear, it's clear that with enough musical interest in other areas, this can be forgone and not have too much of a detrimental effect. This is more subjective, so there's not really much to be said here.



Tonality doesn't require the expression of dominant function. Tonality simply requires that a single note be heard as the tonic at a given time. Which literally every pop song ever follows. For whatever reason, the human brain likes to pick a note and all notes then have some sort of relation to that note. Thus, all popular music is based off this. You can write a piece that sits on I the whole time, just because no V doesn't show up doesn't mean it's not functional.


You have to realize that function is not dictated by raw chords. You can have a whole string of weirdly notated chords and their function still all be either tonic or dominant. Take this excerpt for example https://youtu.be/WP0Mastn3gk?t=150 . It's something like V-iv-III+7-V6/4-i. The functions are actually just V-i though. Through prolongation you can add musical interest while not changing function much. Jepsen's song goes through the same functional changes without outright expressing V. There is certainly dominant function in the song, especially evident when the leading tone (F#) is played. This idea that function is not contingent our well known chords isn't exactly taught at lower levels, as it is pretty complicated and would only serve to confuse the student at a lower level. Schenkerian Theory reconciles pop songs and the issues you're bringing up. 



Ultimately, everything comes back to Tonic and Dominant. Essentially, tension and release. This is hardwired into our brains and cannot be helped. Though tonic and dominant may disguise themselves at time, if you look a little bit closer you will see they are evermore present in pieces like Call Me Maybe.

Of course, but let me rephrase what I said as: What would you have wanted to have studied that you didn't?

&gt; My problem with CPP theory as default is that it is relating to a style that is very specifically situated in a time and place

That is undeniably true, and I very much agree with what you said about the fashions of CPP music becoming less and less relevant - as someone mentioned, a half-decent analogy is people studying Medieval medicine in med school. As far as current medicine goes it's of purely historical interest. The point at which the analogy breaks down is that tonal harmony is still widely used worldwide. What's not used worldwide - and where the genre conventions are becoming less and less relevant - are the intricate and seemingly endless voice-leading rules to do with SATB harmony. Great if you love writing chorales, or you want a deep understanding of tonal Western art music from the 17th thru early 20th century but useless if you want to write music influenced by James Blake. 

&gt; About your point on technology versus "pure music" : I would argue that technology has always informed the development of music - whether that be keyboards and their influence on tuning/temperament....or the technology of written music, and so on and so forth.

Oh for sure but for me the interplay between music and technology is a question of emphasis. If you know how to write and arrange music then writing for four synthesizers is a similar compositional process to writing for string quartet. You're looking to explore what the synthesizer can allow you to do that other instrumental forms might not - in the same way that writing for string quartet allows you to explore musical ideas you wouldn't be able to explore if you were writing for solo oboe. It's not that I'm opposed to technology, it's that I think people get excited by the tech but the proof of the pudding isn't in the tech but in how people use that tech to express themselves musically and that process is a process that can be done with or without modern tech. Boulez, for example - regardless of whether you like his work or not (tbh I'm not a fan) - wrote for both electronics and orchestra. What makes him interesting from an influences point of view is his work with electronics but without that grounding in orchestral composition it's doubtful whether he would have had much of interest to say using an electronic medium. The quality of music isn't found in the technology used to express that music.

I guess also I've watched / listened to numerous production videos, courses, magazines and there's always some new gizmo that promises to give you some amazing sound that will set you apart from everyone else. But what sets great musicians apart from everyone else isn't that they play the 98-string electronic timbre manipulator - it's that they use what's at their disposal in new, interesting and creative ways. The orchestra, for example - you can use it to tell a story of longing and loss as Mahler did, or violent and intimidating pre-Christian rites as Stravinsky did, or paint a picture of the sea like Debussy did ("The audience expected the ocean. Something big, something colossal, but they were served instead with some agitated water in a saucer" - Louis Schneider).



&gt; Finally, with regard to pop music... I strongly disagree with you and your point about "window dressing." To me, this seems like a matter of priority.

I suppose this is my songwriter's mentality showing through. If a song sounds good played on an acoustic guitar and sung by singer with a voice of questionable quality then it will sound great with polish. OTOH there are songs that are just polish and when you take that polish away you realise the song was shit and what made it sound good was the producer. I overstated the case though - I don't think all or most pop music is like that. Hell, I mostly listen to pop music for pleasure because to my ear orchestral works start to sound quite samey some time around the half hour mark. Certainly modern production techniques are able to provide a much broader timbral palette than a standard orchestra, and streaming services mean I can go from one kind of music to another in a few clicks and keep my ear engaged far more easily. I suppose my main point here is that if you have a good song you can dress it up however you like but you can put knickers on a pig and it's still a pig. If you're paying to go to music college wouldn't you rather end up being able to produce things that aren't pigs?

Usually this refers to Sum and Difference tones.

If you have two fundamentals of 110 Hz and 220 Hz, you get a Sum tone of 330 (110+220) Hz and a difference tone of 110 Hz (220-110)

110 is an A. So is 220. But 330 is an E. And of course the other 110 is an A.

So these all line up with the harmonic series on A.

So not only do we have the overtones themselves lining up and constructively interfering, but we could have combination tones as well.

Now, again, Brass have fairly prominent overtones so it's likely that's what's happening is really a combination of factors.

Someone mentions tuning.

Well, this often happens on Flutes (because they're closer to just a sine wave) But if two people are both trying to tune to A=440, but one is at 441, the difference tone is 1 hz - that's 1 pulse per second - that's so slow we don't hear it as a note, but a "pulsing" because again, constructive interference makes the waves increase in volume as their waves come into sync, but cut in volume (but the original note's volumes are still present) when they go out of sync.

This pulsing is usually called "Beating" and that's what you use to tune instruments like this.

As the person playing 441 gradually moves lower, the beating gets slower, because the difference between the tones gets lower. When you can get them to stop beating (as much as is practically possible) then they're as in tune as they're going to get.

These are sometimes called "undertones" and by string players, "Tartini Tones" after the person who first described them on that instrument (or most famously did so).

In reality, difference tones are more obvious because sum tones tend to merge with harmonics already present. And as you get into higher frequencies, them being off - say, 881 for the example I just did - doesn't cause as big a problem with any 880 overtones - once they get up into the 1,000s they could just fall on some other overtone in the series of one of the sounds.

But still, if conditions are right (someone mentions the room, and that's true as well because soundwaves are also length-based, meaning that constructive interference can also happen with an instrument is playing X frequency at a specific multiple of the wavelength's distance to the wall and back and rooms also have resonant frequencies based on shape and size) a combination tone on the high end could "pop out" as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-02-10 08:40:02 mavaction<br>The last topic you get to is a current "pop" issue in math right now. "super permutations". 

The basic issue ... say you want to permute 6 items. There are 720 rearrangements of 6 unique items. (You get that from simple factorial...6 choices for first element.... 5 choices left for second element....6*5*4*3*2*1= 720. )

If you strung them all into one big sequence...you would need to make a string 4320 elements long. But if you did it simply in order.... 123456 then 123465 etc... When you stick those together you get 123456123465 you see you have actually already counted a bunch of other individual permutations... like... 234561 345612 etc... With just twelve elements you have 8 of the permutations already displayed in it. 

The math problem framed the opposite direction of yours. What's the smallest string that will have all the permutations within it? 

The big long string with all the permutations in it is called the **superpermutation**. We know the upper bound... for n permute n it has to be smaller than n*n!=(n+1)!. The lower bound is what we are looking for. 

It has some viral interest because an anonymous person on an anime 4chan board put forth a proof that lowered the lower limit. That result got published. 

But I'm not aware if the minimal length superpermutations have NO repetition on substrings the length of n. Like even the minimal superpermutations we have... might still repeat some permutations....just less than other...not sure. But I think that affects your problem to make sure you have not repeated a 4 note sequence in your giant chords.  

This math youtuber Matt Parker has been keeping people informed. Here he is keeping us up to date on the problem...and recently...like this week some one made even more progress. [Superpermutations: the maths problem solved by 4chan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZzIvl1tbPo)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-02-27 08:19:35 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt; Say you’re out with some musician friends and they start playing a song but you don’t want to interrupt to ask for the key

Fuck that, they're my friends, I shout "what key" :-)

It's harder for me to tell you because I can look at a guitarist, bassist, or keyboard player and see what notes they're playing ;-)

As a, let's say "mature" professional, what I'd now do is listen to the song without playing. I'd let it go through a pass - especially if a typical 4 chord song, and see what it does and if it sounds major or minor, and which of the chords sounds like the tonic (often the first of the cycle).

Then, with the knowledge of whether I think it's major or minor or not, I would just try a note - a somewhat educated guess but even a wild guess.

Now remember, I have decades of playing experience doing this and am familiar with tons of forms and progressions and styles, so I'm going to notice pretty quickly if it's a typical 12 bar shuffle, or a I-IV-V country song and so on (I'm not going to try this on a jazz tune though mind you, or some prog rock tune which needs to be played correctly).

Then I'll just narrow it down from there. Usually I'll close, and then move closer, then have it. Sometimes I luck out and get it on the first or 2nd try.

I have to say, the reason I'm good at doing this is that this is how I learned to play guitar - I turned on the radio every night and played along with the songs.

There was no re-winding of the radio in those days. If you didn't get the song, you had to wait until tomorrow when it might be played again.

I tended to find out chord progressions first, then would know the key in order to improvise, but sometimes I would just noodle around until I found it from a melody standpoint.

Now, of course I had records I could replay, and cassette tapes you could rewind, but I would just often put on something and try to play over every song.

I easily spent at least an hour a night doing that - sometimes more. There were days on the weekend when I was a kid that I literally played from the time I woke up until I went to bed. I forgot to eat a couple of times.

That really served me well in later life because now I can hear a pop song on the radio and know the chord progression and often identify the tonic without ever touching an instrument.

But on stage, on the fly, I need enough information to narrow things down - a pass through to get the general changes - but like I say, I'm generally in a position where I can see what everyone's playing (though those damn 5 string basses still mess me up!) and catch up pretty quickly.

FWIW, for me, this all came from learning songs and leads and riffs by ear. I noodled and tried to make solos, sure, but I also spent a lot of time learning how to play the real song and real solo etc. and that made me more familiar with the sounds of keys and which chords were which and so on.

I'm not going to say I'm great at it - I have colleagues that will kick my butt. But I think that sitting down with a song and learning it, and learning any riffs or solos, on the fly, trial by fire, made me get used to really listening to what's going on and helped me be able to narrow things down more quickly.

Ear training of course helps with this as, if you play a note, you might go "wow, that's like a 5th away rather than a 2nd" so those are good skills to have too.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-01 10:02:39 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;A guitar isn't tonally linear so most chords are going to not be sequential.

HUH?

You know I was talking with about 10,000 other guitarists my whole life and not one of them has brought this up.

You're WAY over-thinking it, especially if you're concocting these kind of statements that have no bearing in anything.

An INVERSION is simply which note is the lowest sounding note of the chord, and yes they make sense.

How the notes of the chord are distributed otherwise is called "voicing".

If you play the low open E string with that same A chord you posted, you now have an inverted chord - it's A/E or an A chord in 2nd inversion, because the 5th of the chord (E) is now the lowest sounding note.

If you don't play the 5th string, you're also playing an A/E because E is again now the lowest-sounding note.

It's all about what the lowest sounding notes is when you're talking inversions.

Play a C Major chord and include the low E - you know have C/E or a C chord in First Inversion.

So yes, inversions do make sense.

G - D/F# - Em or C - G/B - Am are two EXTREMELY common chord progressions on guitar. In each example, the 2nd chord is in First Inversion.

What's less applicable to guitar, and especially pop guitar is *voice-leading* and to some degree retaining consistent voicing structures because the limitations of the instrument mean some voicings are just not possible.

Thus we constantly move between 6 note, 5 note, 4 note, etc. voicings and so on with little concern of where actual parts lead.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-03 17:30:04 simeumsm<br>&gt; if you are stuck into some cliches, it's all your fault. 

It sure is! I'm even breaking some songs apart to learn different progressions and modulations to help me avoid my own cliches.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In 12 equal you there is a variety of different progressions beyond the diatonic that are impossible in a more accurate tuning systems, because they require enharmonic shifts

Sorry, I don't understand this. Could you elaborate?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  IF you are really into diatonic/pop/early classical music, there are better unequal (and equal) tunings than 12 ET (for example - any meantone, any diaschismic or whatever exotic Arabic/African etc tuning you may like) 

But how practical is this? I mean, my style is more rock guitar and I don't have any illusions that I'll be in a famous band. I've read that a band (Sonic Youth, IIRC) used different tunings for different songs and had specific guitars for these specific songs and it was a nightmare to organize everything. 

I'd rather mess up with different scales for sonority rather than mess up with different tunings and almost have to re-learn everything I know, and then convince my band to also change tunings and re-learn everything . At most, tune everything 1 step lower or drop the 6th string.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-06 15:44:54 tigers4eva<br>This question really interests me personally! This is something that i've been working on for a while, and will continue to work on for years. 

To start, the first question is context. Do you have a bass player? If they are holding down the root, you have the opportunity to go ham with inversions. If you don't have one, it might be more worthwhile to restrict their usage. You want the bass note to be the root. Not always, but at least most of the time in most genres. It's a matter of taste.

Next, being a better rhythm guitarist. You have some idea of the importance of voice leading, so I'll start you off with this tip. Play less notes(in the vein of advice given by Nile Rodgers, Robben Ford, etc.). But play them with conviction. Nowadays, I almost never hit all 6 strings. I'm good at muting strings that I don't want to be heard. I used to aim for triads. Now I've rolled it back to 6ths and thirds. Triads are still a great starting spot though. I'd recommend that you start here, before you start with inversions of 7th chords or 6th chords.

An easy way to start with triads is to play the triads on adjacent strings. I'd recommend starting the DGB set. Each triad has 6(3!) ways to be played on each set. As 135, 153, 315, 351, 531, 513. Not all of these are playable. I'd start with 135, 351, 513. Try major and minor chords first. Then try suspended. You'll get some wild ideas when you realize that 125 and 145 and 14b7 are all related structures. (Aka the power of quartal harmony)

Next. Play a simple song. Even a 4 chord pop song works perfectly to get these inversions and sounds in your ear. Take the 4 chords and play them within the span of 4 frets on the guitar. You'll hear how it smoothens out. It's much smoother than just relying on 6th and 5th strong root bar chords. Then, use the same chords, but play in another section of 4 frets on the neck. Just restricting your chords to a small area of the guitar will force you to voice lead, without much other thought necessary.

Afterwards, play around on different string sets. I personally love EDG. It's rough, with some huge left hand stretches. But I love the sound. Especially when you have a busy soundscape from other musicians. It feels like I've arranged a tight brass orchestra with my left hand. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-16 21:43:30 koeno100<br>I'd strongly recommend getting a composition teacher (private or in school, whatever feels right). The internet is a great place to find information on how to do stuff, but sitting with someone even once a month who looks at your work and tries to help you express yourself can be of great value for your work!

I recently completed my first full orchestral work that's getting performed by a commercial orchestra, so maybe I could give you a path to follow based on the one I followed. I read below that you're a guitar player, so am I so maybe you can find yourself in what I'm going to write!

The first step is listening. Listen, discover, then listen more and discover more until you know so much music that you can't even think about anything else but music. Listen to past composers like Mozart and Haydn, but even before that like Bach, but also Palestrina and Guillaume de Machaut, and younger ones like Stravinsky, Webern, etc. The more you listen, the more you tools you have at your disposal. I myself come from a pop background, mostly alt. rock, funk and metal. The first classical composer I actively started listening was Claude Debussy. From there I kind of went back into time, discovering the entire classical repetoire. If you really want to know your names, buy the book "A History of Western Music". I had this book for my music history classes during my musicology studies and it covers most of the important names in western music.

Another important thing is reading and analysis. You say you've got two semesters of music theory covered, so I assume you're at the same level as someone who's done a first year of musicology here in the Netherlands. That should give you enough tools to start analyzing classical era music like Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Start by analyzing piano sonatas. Almost every sonata starts with the sonata form, and if you want to be able to understand symphonies, you have to be able to understand this form, because it was also common practice to write the first movement of a symphony in sonata form. So start by analyzing piano sonatas, find the structures of the sonata form and then get into depth and find how the themes develop, what the motives are, etc. Search for analyses of pieces on the internet to compare to your own findings and perhaps learn thing you couldn't find yourself to improve yourself even more. The most basic requirements is that you can read sheet music and do a harmonic analysis. If you don't know where to find sheet music, [www.imslp.org](https://www.imslp.org) is your goldmine!

If you want to learn to compose a symphony, you have to learn to compose. How? By doing it. Start out with piano pieces. (Or guitar pieces or whatever your main instrument is) Write a chord progression and write a melody over it, then make an accompaniment, etc. Study compositional forms and tools and try to perhaps emulate styles that you like. A nice book covering the fundamentals of compositions is "Fundamentals of Musical Composition" by Arnold Schoenberg. If you want to build a house, you've got to start with the foundation before you can furnish your rooms. What I mean is composing a symphony requires a lot of knowledge and can be very overwhelming. It is a great goal to work towards though! Once you feel comfortable writing these pieces, try writing for ensembles like string quartets or duets or make an ensemble of your own. Also, if you have the possibility, have your pieces played by people! You can learn a lot from working with musicians because not everything you write is phisically possible and finding ways to work around these problems eventually enhances your creativity.

Harmonic progressions are technically the same in classical music as in pop music, except that harmony in classical music follows conventions and rarely stays in one key when we're looking at late romantic music. If we look at the Adagietto in F major of Symphony No. 5, the progression of the first 10 bars is as follows: I - V - I - V - IV-  I6 - i6 - II7 - #io7 - ii - I6 - V. Now this could be used as a chord progression in a pop song, but what makes harmony in classical music sound rather "classical" is the use of non-chordal tones to create fluent lines. Where pop music treats harmony as blocks of chords, classical music often treats harmony as distinct lines that together form a harmony. Note that most music in practice doesn't strictly follow the rules of part-writing. They're merely to train the ear and teach you how music "wants" to behave. Following this rules will of course result in a rather boring chorale because everything follows the rules. The way I use my part-writing skills: I can hear much easier where a chord wants to resolve to or what my options are to resolve certain tones, and so I can also hear what combination definitely WOULDN'T work.

There's much more to say but in summary: listen to music, study and analyze music, start composing simple pieces for one instrument and then move on to larger forms so you can eventually write pieces for orchestra.

Good luck and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-17 04:09:43 65TwinReverbRI<br>In music notation for Guitar and Bass (especially in modern pop contexts) you notate any string to be played Open with a "0" - that's zero, as in "zeroeth fret" and "zero" finger. Usually the font is the same that is used for fingering for other fingers of the fretting hand (1, 2, 3, 4, T). Sometimes you'll also see an "O" (oh) as it also could mean "open".

The following is excellent typical notation for Classical Guitar:

https://www.thisisclassicalguitar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Easy-Guitar-Sample-Notes.png

Note the "0" for open strings.

Notice that once a pattern is established, every single open string is not re-notated as such - so the E in the 3rd measure and the G in the 4th measure don't need an "0" now as it's assumed by this point.

If those notes were to be fretted - for example, the high E could be on the 5th fret of the 2nd string, just having the finger number could be good enough as it should be clear what it is - so a "4" if that's the finger to play it is all that's needed.

But, sometimes more info is needed and the string number is included. String numbers for guitar are an Arabic numeral in a circle - 1-6 (usually a slightly different font than the fingering number, but not always).

Additionally sometimes the position (fret) is indicated as well, and this is done by Roman Numeral with "C" in front, like CVII or C.VII (I prefer the latter).

Some people use the "C" just to mean "position" in general, and some use it specifically to mean Barre chords. On bass that might not be an issue but the people who use it only on Barre chords just put a Roman Numeral. Here's some well-notated music with string numbers and position numbers included:

https://www.8notes.com/school/scores/guitar/tarrega_adelita.gif

Notice that the very first measures show the E and G notes are to be played on strings 3 and 2 - the numerals in circles. Also the "IX" shows you are starting in 9th position with your first finger over the 9th fret, the first note high E to be played by finger 4.

The first low open E note HAS to be played as an open string, so no need to notate it, but some people might. Usually we assume the lowest possible version of a note (closest to the nut) when no other information is given.

You can though see the "0" used in the last measure of the first system as it might not be clear that some, but not all of those notes possible on open string should be taken on open strings.

The other system of notating it is Tablature, and in some case some publications include both. But Tablature alone is fine as it clearly indicates which string and fret a note should be taken on.

Now, in terms of your getting to sound different for playback, you're probably stuck. Honestly I don't think it would be worth the effort. Open strings are "brighter" and "more ringy" so it's possible you could go into a DAW and just select those specific notes that are open and give them a higher filter cutoff point or use an EQ on just that note (which would be easier if it were on a different track). Also you could put all the open string notes on a different track and assign a different instrument to them and try to find something that sounds more like an open string versus a fretted string. But this is just very time consuming for very little return on that investment IMHO. By the time you do all that you might as well just record the live bass.

_____

One slight aside, string players use "sul G" to say "play this note on the G string" and sometimes you see that in guitar music (rarely) but they also use string numbers but use Roman Numerals - so if you were to ask this of a classical Double Bass player, they might say the numerals are different - I'm working from a modern published system that's commonplace for modern guitar and electric bass notation, which shares much with classical guitar published sheet music now as well).

But I'm guessing you don't have that much time or insane level of commitment!

The problem, of course, is that they did have such a wide spectrum of influences, spreading themselves across several pop subgenres.  And yet they still sounded like themselves!  A lot of that - IMO - is in the vocal style, especially Lennon's nasal timbre.  Their harmonies (inspired mainly by the Everlys) were quite harsh for the time, they didn't use vibrato or attempt any sweetness of tone.   And they also understood the power of falsetto at moments of drama, to get the girls screaming.   

The guitar tones were often distinctive too: those clanging semi-acoustics: Harrison's Gretsch, Lennon's Rickenbacker, the occasional Epiphone Casino, the Rickenbacker 12-string.  And of course McCartney's bouncy and melodic Hofner bass and Starr's cymbals, often zinging and hissing throughout the songs (at least in the early days).

In terms of song form, they would freely extend or truncate sections to follow the natural phrasing of the lyrics.  They would express their influences lightly, even humorously.  They never took themselves too seriously.

But you could take inspiration from Neil Innes' Rutles, who showed that Beatles pastiche was easier than you might think....

(In minor, the VII and VI are sometimes written as bVII and bVI, to show that they're not built on the same root notes as their major versions.)

Basically, take the downward fifth (or upward fourth) root motion from V to I, and then copy that into a sequence of that same direction of motion, and if you do it all the way you cycle through all seven notes of the scale as chord roots.

This is semi-common progression in pop music as well as other western music (though elements of it show up more often these days in east Asian pop than in western pop): https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CircleOfFifths

Essentially this is setting up for the V-I cadence, and then setting up for the setup for the V-I cadence, and setting up for the setup for the setup for the V-I cadence, and so on.

There are some variants to this, the most common of which are to cut the cycle in half and take only the last four chords (vi ii V I), or to do that and then replace ii with IV.  (And similarly with minor.)

You can also adjust the notes in some of these.  Note that only V-I and I-IV have the full true V-I flavor to them (I-IV is just V-I in the IV chord's key), but people often alter the chords to make more pairs have V-I flavor, because V-I flavor is a strong harmonic direction.  Some people even string together an infinite series of V7-flavor chords.

The circle of fifths is not the only way to write harmony -- but some of its progressions, particularly anything including the last pair (i.e. V-I), form a strong forward motion, so it's a useful trope.  And like all tropes, it's a tool available to you when you want to use it, though not necessarily the only tool you want to use.  (Note that you can also prepare V-I with a variety of other chords before the V.)

And you can also do what I might call "retrograde" motion -- i.e. I to V, or IV to I.  This is going "backwards" in the circle, but is apparently also rather common in pop music (the very common I V vi IV is an example of both).  I don't personally like it as much, because I feel that it gives a sense of stagnation, but that's just my opinion -- it's clearly very popular.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-28 22:37:55 ferniecanto<br>There's a lot of stuff there to discuss, and a lot of stuff to process. First off, I don't know what resources you've been using to understand harmony, but I can see in your descriptions of frequency ratios many of the symptoms of what I consider an *absolutely wretched* way of teaching music. See, I'm not critiquing your knowledge; I'm critiquing the methods of teaching that you've fallen prey to, and which I try to deconstruct as much as I can. To put it short: the way you understand harmony isn't based on "pure math". Such thing isn't really possible, because "pure math" is simply a group of axioms and theorems you can derive from them, and they don't need to have any relationship whatsoever to the real world. The moment you try to make a connection between mathematics and real world phenomenon, we're talking about applied math, and there are ENDLESS ways in which we can apply mathematics to the physical world. For example, I could devise an entire system of consonance which is based on applying the golden ratio to sound frequencies, and I could argue it's based on "pure math"; but that system is entirely incompatible with what you're describing, so using "pure math" here makes no sense.

The harmony you describe is based on a physical property of objects: the sound produced by an object can be decomposed into several frequencies, and those frequencies tend to roughly follow a pattern, in which every frequency is a multiple of the lowest frequency, a.k.a. the "fundamental". It's believed that our brains have evolved to identify this pattern and recognise it as "natural". This is why ratios of 2:1, 3:2, 5:3, etc., are more "consonant"; because they're very prevalent in nature. If you blow into a bottle or pluck a string, those ratios will naturally arise (well, *roughly*; only ideal objects could produce exactly those ratios, and objects in the physical world aren't ideal), and that's where consonance comes from. Consonance is not a mathematical property; it's a *phenomenon of* ***perception***. And even though perception is naturally linked to how the real world works, it's reasonable to think there's a physical explanation to how we perceive consonance and dissonance; but the world is very complex and diverse, and humans are *weird*, so we can't boil down our entire understanding of music down to a bunch of fractions.

This is why you have all those doubts about other factors that can make sounds more or less dissonant: perception isn't that simple. And yes, those are all valid questions, but they're complicated and difficult to delve into. It's a lot easier and more satisfying (and earns more likes on YouTube) to just rattle on about the harmonic series and say "simpler ratios are more pleasant" and stuff like that, but that creates this huge distortion in the understanding of music. This obsession with frequency ratios and proportions is, I believe, one reason why we get such a high amount of questions about chords and so little about melody. It feels sometimes like a lot of people think chords are the only thing that matters in music, and, well, they ain't.

Well, one thing you're doing right: you're experimenting with sound and testing your own perception. That's fundamental, so keep doing that. And yes, if it sounds good, it *IS* good. Never let anyone convince you otherwise.

As for the question of why we use theory: you're pretty much on the spot when you say that, if we want to emulate music from a certain period or style, we have to follow its rules. And that's exactly what music theory is there for: the majority of music we make and listen to follows tonal principles. Pitches are organised in specific ways to create specific impressions, and that's true in all forms of popular music in the west: pop, rock, hip hop, jazz, neoclassical, EDM and so on. Of course, each genre has its own variations, but they have many more similarities than differences. So, if you want to make music that sounds familiar to a general public, it's best to follow the guidelines that music theory has laid out (it's not proper to talk about "rules" anymore; they're mostly suggestions). The process you described to create chords, i.e. use every other note, is one of the most basic foundations of tonal music, so if you repeat that process, your music already sound rather familiar.

But if the ideas you get in your head doesn't follow those patterns, and if the patterns of traditional tonal music don't represent the music you want to make, there's no much point in following those guidelines; and if there's one thing the 20th century has done for music, is provide ways to break away from tonal music. But of course, those sounds tend to sound more harsh to us, not because they're "mathematically dissonant", but because we're *less exposed* to them. If you spend enough time listening to Stockhausen, dissonance will gradually become more natural to your ears. And the truth is that most people don't expose themselves to Stockhausen that often, so dissonance remains "harsh" to them. So, if there's one thing that music theory can do to you is show you *how traditional and familiar* your music sounds like. Sticking to a major scale and only using triads? That's traditional. Using all notes equally without regards to scale? That's untraditional (I'm talking about popular music here, folks, not classical or avantgarde). So, studying theory can give you ways of knowing how far your can go into "untraditional" territory before it becomes too hard to digest; but theory won't show if your music sounds "good" or "right". Only your ears and your brain can decide that.

So, if you want to study more about chords and scales, forget the math. Math will either make things too complicated or too simplistic. Focus on the *musical* concepts, and don't be scared of the music jargon; it's there to help. Learn the names of the intervals, the scales, the modes (I mean major and minor; leave the diatonic modes for some other time) and so on. Think of music in terms of sensations, not Hertz. Study the "traditional" chords, but keep experimenting with the weird ones, and most importantly: trust your ears and follow your intuition. Don't be scared.

Popular music tends to resolve but there are tons of examples of stuff that doesn't necessarily resolve. If what you really mean is why do we restrict ourselves to 12 notes, that's mostly due to the restriction of the piano, a common compositional tool, which isn't able to play microtones. On many string instruments, especially fretless ones, you can play all sorts of microtones and go nuts. Not to mention with voice and so on. But that said, unless you are really clearly creating atonal music, it would just sound like you're out of tune in most cases.

There are also a lot of hip hop songs that have microtonal elements, like samples taken from in between string bends on guitars, sax, etc.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-04-22 00:08:57 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;Are there any unwritten rules for writing for string ensembles, or is this free reign as I am the composer?

Most people would pick "high, medium, and low" which could be Violin, Viola, and Cello. But it's possible to do this we 3 Celli (which was not uncommon in pop tunes that use strings).

Since all the strings are similar enough in terms of technical ability and agility, I would write out the parts first without any particular instruments in mind, then figure out which would be the best instrument to play a given part.

It then becomes partly about the sound you want - a Cello constantly playing in the Violin range will sound more "strident" (but can be beautiful still) than a Violin - think of it like playing higher notes on your lower strings - do you want the sound of an E note (standard tuning here) on the first string open, the 2nd string 5th fret, the 3rd string 9th fret, the 4th string 14th fret etc.? Each one has a different sound and effect.

While strings can be asked to do something similar (violin can play it's high E on the lower strings just like us) you could sort of (sort of) think of a Viola as a "5 string Violin" - it's got a "lower string added" - which would be like you taking something on the 6th string, and then playing it in a higher position on a 7th string.

Cello is sort of like to Viola, the relationship between Guitar and Electric Bass - an octave down - but Cello is more in the range of a Guitar and String Bass more like and Electric Bass.

But you can also think of it this way - Violin is tuned the same a Mandolin.

It's going to be everything from the standard tuned G string up. The high E on the violin is the guitar's E string 12th fret! Put a capo on a standard guitar at the 12th fret and you have a more typical violin range.

Viola is going to cover more of, if you put the capo on the middle of the neck - fret 5 (high string is A)

Cello is going to be more like a Guitar in Drop C, or in standard tuning with a B string.

And Bass is of course like Electric Bass.

Cello, like guitar, can go very high, so it can cover a lot of the range that the Viola might cover and if you only need 3 parts, and the Bass is covering the Bass part as an electric bass might, there may be no need for a viola (but the usual reason people leave it out is because they're afraid of the Alto Clef).

So there's nothing "wrong" with not using the Viola to cover the notes in the Viola's typical range, the Cello can do all but the very highest notes (which the Violin will likely take) it'll just sound "different" on Cello than it would Viola - which may not be that big a deal.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-05-07 19:00:36 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;Is a ‘string quartet’ a ‘thing’ beyond just having four string instruments play in one piece,

Yes, and that's the issue.

Now, people are people, and there's always going to be those people out there who go "it's art you can do what you want" and "stop gatekeeping" and so on, but it's kind of like writing a movie screenplay, complete with scene direction and so on.

Sure, you can take your iPhone out and call up the video app and press record and say you "made a movie".

But you didn't make Avengers: Endgame.

That's a whole different level.

And a String Quartet - as we understand and typically refer to the genre - is a major Hollywood Release, not a "student film" or even a "home movie".

Let's put it this way: Mozart is often regarded as one of the most amazing composers ever, who mastered every single form in the Classical Era, and who was a child prodigy - someone who began composing at an astonishingly early age and composing well at that age.

There are two things that everyone on the planet wants to do when they "start composing".

The first is to compose a String Quartet (usually that, or "my first Symphony").

The second is to do so without the aid of a teacher (or really, any musical training whatsoever).

As great as Mozart was - as naturally gifted as he was - what do you think his first piece was? Do you think he worked without a teacher?

So what makes everyone else think they can do it? Well, because they are so uninformed about music that they just have no clue what they're doing.

_____

Back to the previous idea - "the" String Quartet is not just a piece for four string instruments in the way we take it. It is a FORM and a TYPE of piece that has some fairly well-defined elements to it.

For example, the "classic" String Quartet is for 2 Violins, Viola, and Cello, is typically in 4 movements, with the 2nd movement being an Adagio and the 3rd movement a Minuet and Trio, and the first movement is generally in Sonata Form.

In the hands of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, The String Quartet really becomes the "ultimate show of a composer's ability" aside from the solo Keyboard Sonata.

Granted, Haydn's early String Quartets are little more than Baroque Suites for that instrument combination.

But we usually take the word to mean the mature Haydn - through Beethoven form.

Now, can you write for Violin, Violin, Cello, and Bass, (people skip Viola because they can't read Alto clef...so what does that tell you) and call it a "String Quartet" and write some simple little 4 chord loop progression a la EDM styled pop music and call it a "String Quartet" if you want to.

But really, it's where those "in the know" see the most naivete coming through. One may not care about that. But it exists.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-05-13 00:30:15 Ijerkofftoanimegirls<br>"and a good deal of contemporary classical"

Sure, if you are talking about the Contemporary Classical that isn't actually classical music and is just pop music with a string section and a piano then that is true. But real Contemporary Classical is either not tonal at all or would never be analyzed the same way as Jazz.

"common practice has the 7 imply b7 unless explicitly stated otherwise" in common practice harmony, the amount of extensions are diatonic.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-05-27 12:14:01 65TwinReverbRI<br>What is it you want to compose? Some people use the word "compose" very broadly to mean more like "songwriting" or "beatmaking" which is different than what others mean - they mean "compose" to me the more traditional act of writing music down on paper for themselves and others to perform in a "concert music" setting, like orchestral, chamber music, and vocal genre forms.

The first thing you need to do is listen to tons of the music you want to compose.

The second is to learn to play as much of it as you can.

The third is to analyze the music - tear it apart and see what it's made up of, and learn what the elements are and do so if you want to create similar sounds you can use those same devices.

Fourth, you should pick pieces as models. If for example, you played Classical Guitar, you'd want to pick something like maybe a basic arpeggio type Etude like you'd find in Carcassi's method book, and try to write something similar to that. If it's a pop style, you'd want to pick a basic song and try to write something similar in terms of chord structure, form (verse, chorus, bridge, etc.) and even things like groove and strumming patterns and so on. However, I should mention here that most pop players do not "compose" like classical composers - they don't typically write things down specifically. They'll write lyrics, and maybe the chord progression, and sometimes for more advanced styles they'll write down melody lines and maybe riffs and so on, but a most of the time the vast majority of pop forms are written by rote and to some degree recording (of course many people write in a DAW now so they "record" as they go).

Fifth, you have to start simple. Sorry. Everyone wants to start with a Symphony or String Quartet, or write something "Epic" (yawn). Even the greatest composers of all time started with very basic pieces. And today, one of the primary reasons that most people on the internet on forums like these have trouble writing music is that they simply haven't learned to play well enough to write very much, and/or don't have very much exposure to the music they want to compose (you would not believe the number of people who are out there composing a string quartet who've actually never even heard one or listened intently to one!). Many people get super frustrated because they're trying to write things they just don't have the skill set to write yet. It's a good thing to want to write great stuff, and it's important to be self-critical enough to help yourself improve, but you also can't set totally unachievable goals and beat yourself up for not being able to reach them!

Finally, get a teacher! Even the greatest composers had teachers - often great composers themselves! You may just want to write for fun, and that's OK, but having some instruction and guidance will help you develop faster and again prevent you from just getting frustrated. This could come (and typically would come) in the form of Piano or Guitar lessons, where your teacher not only worked with you on the instrument itself, but would also help you start creating your own music. In pop music, especially in forms like Jazz where improvisation and reharmonization is part and parcel of the style, you'd be given the instruction necessary to do those things which lead naturally into writing your own pieces. For other pop styles, or classical music, you might have to express your interest in writing to your teacher, but they can help you work towards those goals if they know that's part of what you're after.

Obviously, you can also just kind of "do it on your own" but in the end you'd spend a lot more time doing that than with the help of a teacher - you'd accelerate much more quickly with instruction. That may not matter to you, but again it can become frustrating if you don't have the guidance to help you set realistic goals and to give you criticism and help you improve. Otherwise you're just shooting in the dark.

Basically, genre = what kind of instrumentation is required for the performance of the work, i.e. string quartet, jazz trio, solo guitar, kazoo orchestra.) A cantata is typically a work for choral and solo singers with instrumental accompaniment.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-07-03 05:12:03 65TwinReverbRI<br>So, when I was 12 or so, I sat down, turned on the radio, and picked up my guitar.

I would run my finger up and down the low E string playing notes until I found what sounded like the right note, and then try a major chord there. If it didn't sound right, I tried minor. If that didn't sound right I tried to find another note that sounded right within the chord, and repeated that process.

Since the chords in the music were also changing all the time, I had to remember where certain chords were, and when i got one had to remember where that one went, and kept working to fill in the gap.

When I had a cassette tape, or record, I could play the song over and over (or a section over and over) - you can do that now with Audacity (which is free - and I use that today for the same process still!) - until I figured out all or most of the song.

Sometimes, a song like Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love" would come on the radio, which consists primarily of just one lick played over and over through the whole song, which gave you plenty of chances to figure out what it was.

But a song like Led Zeppelin's "Black Dog" was much harder, because the lick is long with lots of notes, odd rhythm, hard to remember, and so on. It took me a long time just to get the main riff down on that one.

Obviously, doing your homework in terms of knowing how to  play your chords is imperative. It's also useful to know scales and keys (I had taken piano lessons before so that helped).

If you're talking about pop music (which I assume you are), "cadences" are not something you care about. You just learn the parts that are played on your instrument (or other parts if you want to).

I play guitar and I grew up in an era when most music was "guitar based" - it's why I didn't care to learn so many songs in the 1980s "New Wave" scene because they were mostly synthesizer (but I learned them on synth ;-)

But it really helps to seek out music that is for a single primary instrument like that. A lot of today's modern synth sounds are actually complex and you don't "Play" the music, you just push one note down and it plays a lot of stuff for you - you can't really learn to manually play that, you need the exact same patch. So that can really be harder to learn.

Much pop music uses bass lines that are the same pitch as the chordal part in root position, meaning if you figure out the bass note is C, it's a C or Cm chord (or maybe C7, etc.). If the bass note is G, it's most likely a G or Gm chord and so on.

Now, learning to read music, or tabs for guitar, or at least chord charts can be helpful too, as well as using video tutorials. There's nothing wrong with that but you still want to make sure you develop your listening skills.

Identify the chord roots from the bass line, figure out the chords, what key it is (which helps you eliminate the less common chord options), and then start playing it.

You have to start simple, and gradually get more complex. But don't be afraid to learn only a single section of a song. It's better to learn tons of short sections than to spend a long time trying to learn just one single piece. The more you do that, the easier it will get to learn entire pieces as you go.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-07-03 11:08:26 65TwinReverbRI<br>If you play a chord progression like Am - G - F - G and repeat, that's in A minor.

You would play A Minor Pentatonic over it.

If the progression were C - Em - F - C, that's C Major, you'd play C Major Pentatonic over it.

If you try to play A Minor Pentatonic over the C chord progression it's just going to sound like C Major Pentatonic because the harmony kind of "wins out".

And this is because of what you already know - they're the same scale basically.

But what makes the two different - besides how the chord progression will make them seem, is musical emphasis.

While you shouldn't really just run up and down the scale, you should focus on the notes that make the scale what it is by playing, say, C on the down beat, as opposed to A on the downbeat. Melodic lines should resolve to C in C, and A in Am.

So it's not really what you play (the "pattern" that is either scale) but HOW you play it - which notes you play when, and how you emphasize them.

Another way to look at this is, if you were going to solo over Brown-Eyed Girl (or rather, if you had the unfortunate luck to have to :-) the song is in G Major, so you'd use G Major Pentatonic - and even though it's the same shape as Em, you'd want to be *thinking* G - and focusing on the elements of the scale that give it more "G-ness".

But if you were playing over Blood and Roses by The Smithereens, which is in E minor (it's tuned down a half step though) you'd want to use Em pentatonic - same scale again, but it's about the emphasis.

For example, that typical Chuck Berry lick where you bend the 3rd string up and then hit the B and E strings on the same fret (say 12th) is going to be very "E" sounding, and playing that over the G Major progression isn't going to sound quite right. 

So it's about how you focus the notes - and you learn this from learning solos of others.

As A-5-Star-Man mentions, you can also use them in other ways but probably the most common thin in pop/rock is to use the in a bluesy fashion, which is actually kind of counter-intuitive - you'd use A Minor Pentatonic over a Blue in A - which is A "major". So you play a minor pentatonic over an otherwise major progression. And this is what gives you your "blue notes".

The absolute best thing you can do is start learning solos and start identifying what scale they use, and if they're pentatonic, see how they use them.

I haven't delved deep enough into Japanese folk music to confirm this. What I have noticed is common among a lot of anime openings (both of the jrock or pop variants) is the following:

-In place of a four chord progression restricted to just major/minor chords are longer progressions that more often extended chords
-Layers upon layers of instrumentation between doubled guitars, catchy string bits, active basslines and more. Every part of the musical outfit usually exhibits top-notch musicianship
-I think there is a possibility that there are some melodies that are more native to Japanese music and foreign to our ears and therefore it pulls us in. 
-Seeing a video with your favorite anime characters + hearing the song will probably make it a lot more emotive, especially after a whole season

Sure it’ll be tough but there’s going to be so much of it you already know intrinsically but you just don’t know how to put into words. I took it in high school, and though it was taught by an incompetent person, it helped me get a full rung up as a songwriter above the average musician, though I’m still 1-2 rungs below people who went to Berklee and stuff. 

Stuff you’ll be able to leave knowing:
Chords, all kinds. Using chords that are in well written pop music or less in your face mind if music. In the sense that say many rock bands just play power chords and major chords. But there you can get more exposure to 7ths, diminished, augmented, inversions, combos, etc. 

I’m sad to say I’ve lost my ability to apply diminished and augmented chords well, I wanna get back to that. 

-part writing! Very important, for string parts, voices, keys. You’ll start with basic 4 part writing which is stiff and formal but it will teach you a lot. Now that I think of it, one of my best strengths is my vocal harmonies (often 3-4 part harmonies) and I think that can be directly traced back to AP music theory. I’m much more intuitive about it now and not formal, but that training helped. About what does parallel action feel like? Or counterpoint movement? Stuff like that. It helps you learn how to keep those things fresh. The Beatles were great vocal part writers. Other bands, sometimes much less inventive. 

I could say more stuff but these are the biggest points that come to mind.

And reading sheet music is always a good skill. And being able to instantly know an interval. 

Which here’s a trick:

Ennnn Beeee Ceeee (nbc logo song) the first two notes are a sixth. 

Here comes the bride. “Here comes” is a fourth. 

Somewhere over the rainbow. “Some where” is an octave.

The first thing you need to do is go to the Music Department website of any university you're considering and thoroughly check out the audition requirements.

If you have questions, contact the Music Department and/or the Guitar Instructor there.

Get your answer from the horse's mouth!
________

Most universities with a BM require you to be able to read music, and play music proficiently.

So the next thing you need to do is get a teacher - one who's been through a university-level Music degree who can get you prepared.

As I said, I sit on the panel and at our university, one of the big things I see - especially with guitarists (and other "pop" players) is that not only are they not very proficient at their instrument, but they're just totally clueless when it comes to "academic" music - largely because they didn't come up in the typical private lesson/HS Band et al kinds of programs.

_________

There is hope - but you need to FORGET THEORY. 

You need to PLAY.

We don't care if you "understand" the Major Scale.

We're going to say: "Play a G major scale".

If you can't, you're not getting in.

I'll ask guitarists for G, Ab, and Eb - one they should easily know, at least in Open Position, the other shows they know how to handle sharps and flats, and the last shows that they know how to find notes not on the 6th string, and start a scale form from the 5th string (it's playable from the 6th, but if they just use the form for Ab and move it up the neck I'll ask them if they can do another form of it in a different position).

The music you need to play needs to be something "more intricate" than strumming through a chord progression typically.

One guy came in and did "Something" by The Beatles. He played through the chords (which have some nice chords besides just major and minor and power chords) and has a nice solo he played note for note. Then he improvised a solo over the chord progression.

Another guy came in and played a nice Acoustic piece that was finger-picked and rather intricate, with harmonics, a few taps on the top of the guitar, and was a melody that had accompaniment.

Those are the kind of things we're looking for (outside of jazz, where we like to hear someone comp, play the head, and improvise)

That second guy above - I talked to him when he was in high school - his responses were kind of like yours - and I told him just what I'm telling you - get a teacher, work towards the audition requirements first and foremost.

Well, he didn't. He came, and auditioned, and while he played that acoustic piece really well, he could barely read music (learned if from tab and by ear/video) and couldn't really find where the notes are.

He got accepted "provisionally", which means he took lessons for a semester, with our instructor, and then re-auditioned then got in. So he's a "semester behind".

_____

So you're not dreaming - it's surely possible, but not by fantasizing about it and being aimless about it. You don't need to be online trying to learn theory - your SOLE goal is to prepare for that audition.

You can of course work on some of it on your own, but you're basically increasing your chances for failure by not getting with a qualified instructor who's familiar with these programs. Don't forget that every kid who comes through a band program has a band director who has a BM in Education and who's been through all that stuff themselves. Many piano students study with a teacher who has a BM in performance or education or at least some kind of certificate and so on - again they know what it takes to get in.

Sitting around "hoping" you're going to get in is not going to get you in. Finding out exactly what you need, and having someone help you determine if you currently have what you need, and if not help you get it, is what's going to get you in.

______

Music programs are pretty rigorous. You WILL get better at your craft IF you INVEST in your education. However, be careful because some programs are still very "Classical" based, and others are very "Jazz" based, because as a general rule the pieces get to greater complexity levels than a vast majority of pop tunes (not including technical virtuosic pieces). That means you're going to study a lot of Jazz and/or Classical guitar - which may not be what you want. However, the knowledge from either/both is certainly transferable to the pop genre.

The guy above I was talking about - the first concert they did with Guitar Ensemble he did great! The most recent Jury (which is your end of year performance for grades) he did was excellent - he's essentially "caught up" to where he should be!

And while he's getting much better at guitar with all this "academic" study, even though it's more jazz-based (though the Guitar Ensemble concert was arrangements of Beatles tunes!) he still plays in a pop band and gigs around town. So one doesn't preclude the other.

______

All this said, you can still "further your education" without getting a music degree. Obviously most of the worlds most famous pop musicians don't have music degrees, and those that even have degrees often have them in different fields (marketing, communications, theater, business - things that someone in the Entertainmen **Industry** needs to know).

And of course many of those did that because they didn't want the "traditional academic" music degree (and didn't "need" it, though they could have benefited from it possibly).

But there are also plenty of people working behind the scenes that are very well-trained and that might be your cup of tea - or, of course if you like Jazz or Classical, win-win.

______

Just so you know, our audition requirements for Guitar are basically:

2 pieces of contrasting style, mood, or technique.

We ask for a couple of Major scales.

We ask for a couple of chords - Major, Minor, 7, m7, Maj7 - Open chords are OK, but Barre chords are kind of expected.

We give them a Sight-Reading example - usually the melody from something like "Autumn Leaves" - half, quarter, and 8th notes, mostly in a key (a key with accidentals in it, so not C Major!).

Then we test pitch-matching (a note played at the piano is asked to be sung back - we do a couple of notes, and a couple of melodic intervals).

On that same day, the students take a Theory placement exam, and a Sight-singing placement exam.

If they can't do ANY theory, they're placed in "level 0" - Music Fundamentals.

If they can do a bit, they go into Level 1 of both.

So knowing theory is not a make or break thing for us - in fact, we don't really expect students to know ANY theory beyond fundamentals - reading music, knowing basic note values, meters, reading their clef, and that's it. Flute players typically don't come in being able to read Bass Clef nor do they know anything about Chords. So that stuff just doesn't influence whether they get in or not, other than if they just simply can't read music at all.

Playing well, but not being able to sight read well will get you in provisionally (as the sight reading portion is used to determine not really how well they sight read, but if they can even read music at all). Not being able to play every single scale on the planet doesn't keep you from getting in. We ask Major scales, and that's it. No minor, no modes, etc.

And generally speaking, if a student doesn't really know their scales, and can't pitch match, and can't sight read, they typically won't be able to play their pieces very well anyway. Those other things are all basically checks to make sure the student just didn't spend two years learning the crap out of 2 pieces and can play them great, but can't play anything else! (could happen).

If a player plays "so-so" and does well on the other things, we can accept them provisionally.

But generally, we expect the pieces they pick to be performed well, correct notes and rhythm, in time, with musical expression, and that they can get through the other stuff pretty well.

It's not like if they miss a note we don't let them in or keep them in provisional, but there needs to be a **reasonable level of proficiency** on the instrument. And for guitar, I can tell you that strumming through chords and wanking a pentatonic blues scale ain't it (we also want to hear students play existing music, not just a jam or improv).

_________

All schools are different through - I'm sure there are institutions that are much more competitive and if you mess up a basic Major scale, you're probably going to be put at the bottom of the pile if not outright rejected.

And I'm sure there are programs where just being able to strum chords and wank blues scales would be OK.

So that's why it's so important to get it from the school you plan to attend. But I wouldn't automatically say, "well I'll never be able to do that so I'll just apply elsewhere" - don't sell yourself short - YOU CAN DO IT!!!

**Research** the programs that are available and do some **soul-searching** to make sure it's really what you want to do. If so, **take the necessary steps to prepare for the audition** which would be getting an instructor who can help you prepare.

And then, preparing for that audition needs to become your life (nerves even get the best prepared of students, and we understand that, but still, if you think you're prepared, prepare some more ;-)

Sorry, but does authentic cadence means plagal. I am not familiar with some of the \*alternate\* words of cadences.   


So, only a certain type of inversions can resolve to a certain type of inverted tonics?   


I was given this by my theory teacher [http://www.clt.astate.edu/tcrist/theory1/dom7.pdf](http://www.clt.astate.edu/tcrist/theory1/dom7.pdf)   


My approach to voice leading is more on paper, and partially through listens (sadly). I can visualize where the notes must go, what is the \*closet\* note that the fifth chord must resolve to the first chord.   


Why do you think it's not popular in pop music or strict? I can think of one reason maybe?   


The use of MIDI. I have seen people who just stack chords up and down freely. I have had someone make a bassline that was literally out of the 4-string bass register (but thankfully I had another low-B string). I believe, the use of MIDI sequencers and lack of sheet music has led people astray from \*reading\* the voice-leading motions/contrary motions and just... well, playing and making chords as they please.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-26 00:38:16 RyanT87<br>There is no definite rule for determining time signatures.

The time signature is simply a key for interpreting the notation. Perhaps an apt metaphor is to compare it to money. If I say this thing costs 2, what is that 2 of? Dollars? Euros? Yen? I'd need to specify it by saying it's $2, but I could also technically write that same amount of money as 200¢. And I could even think of that in varying ways, i.e., as consisting of 8 quarters, 20 dimes, 40 nickels, or 200 pennies. This also makes me think of the story [Verizon Math](http://verizonmath.blogspot.com/2006/12/verizon-doesnt-know-dollars-from-cents.html), where they quoted a customer .002¢/KB for roaming in Canada but then charged him $0.002/KB.

The key thing to remember about musical notation (with few exceptions) is that the notation should be as simple as possible so as to facilitate ease of reading. In terms of pitch, it's a lot easier to read F than D#x, so we write an F even though the two pitches sound the same. (Of course there are times where we might choose a slightly more complicated spelling for some harmonic or melodic reason, but I won't go into that here.) Similarly, if we were to transcribe some pop song that had never been notated, we could choose any number of time signatures. Usually we'll try to match the time signature with the audible metric groupings (e.g., if we hear it in duple duple or groups of four, we'd choose four beats per measure rather than three—though technically we *could* write it in a triple meter and it wouldn't be entirely incorrect; it simply wouldn't necessarily capture the metric connotations of strong and weak beats...). But with these four-beat groupings, how do we choose to notate it? Should we make each beat equivalent to a quarter note? To an eighth note? To a half note? Ultimately, it doesn't matter what we choose; all the time signature tells us is how to interpret the notation. If we chose 4/8, that's telling the reader that in the notation we've chosen, there are four beats per measure and the eighth note equals the beat.

As to 12/8 vs. 4/4, you are absolutely correct. If you're feeling four beats in a measure and there are three sub-pulses in each beat, you could write it in either time signature. When you decide which you'd like to use, keeping in mind that you want to try to make the notation as simple as possible, perhaps you'd want to choose 12/8 instead of 4/4 so that you don't need to add a bunch of extra notation indicating triplets everywhere. But if there's only a few places of triplets, it'd probably be simpler to see a bunch of quarter notes with a few triplets here and there rather than a bunch of dotted quarter notes.

With 5/4 vs. 3/4 + 2/4, it's the same thing—again, you could do either. One on hand, 5/4 is going to be simpler to notate and to read because you won't have to write/read a bunch of changing time signatures or those little dashed barlines between the 3/4 and 2/4 measures. But maybe you might choose this latter and slightly more involved notation because it's really important to you to convey the sense of two "primary" downbeats. But neither is wrong.

So all together, it's like this: if I were selling lemonade at a stand, I could write on my sign that one cup costs $.50 or 50¢ or 2 Quarters or $.34 AUD or €.44 and these are all the same amount of money, just simply written in different ways. In the same way, I could notate some music in 4/4 or 4/8 or 4/2 or 4/64 or two measures of 2/16 and so long as I set the tempo accordingly, these are all the same. All the time signature does is define the relationship between the beat and the notation (and with the tempo marking, the temporal duration of each note).

There's another interesting aspect to this matter. Just like how sometimes authors will write words in unconventional ways to portray a certain dialect to achieve a desired effect, sometimes composers will notate things in a perhaps unexpected way to create a certain effect (even if it's only to create a certain mental effect on the performer reading the music). For instance, usually half and whole notes connote a slower feeling or tempo, so a lot of times you'll see sacred music notated with such a time signature (e.g., 4/2 instead of 4/4) so as to subtly infuse a broader and thus somewhat more reverent feeling; it sort of unconsciously causes the performer to play it a little slower, to linger on the note ever so slightly longer, almost as if meditating on each note. When I see these half and whole notes, it somehow makes me *feel* different than if I were seeing it in eighths and quarters. On the other hand, usually when we see sixteenth and thirty-second notes, it implies something fast. For example, in the [second movement of Schoenberg's Third String Quartet](https://youtu.be/K_0W5MIQrT0?t=498), he uses a lot of these sixteenths and thirty seconds in 4/8, but it's Adagio at eighth note = 60. To me, even though it's a slow movement, the sheer density of notation with all the beams creates a sense of anxiety or uneasiness in me when I look at it. There's really no good reason why he couldn't have notated this in 4/4 with a *lot* fewer beams necessary, but he made the conscious decision to notate it this way. Back in the eighteenth century, there were even musicians who would write theories about the meanings or connotations of certain time signatures, like how one connoted a pastoral sense, another a certain type of dance, etc. (This isn't my specialty and I don't have my notes handy to find more details about this, but I bet u/nmitchell076 could chime in with a bunch on this.)

So as you're working on notation and transcribing, don't get hung up on the time signature. Focus on trying to understand the pulses and the meter and choose a time signature that you feel best captures these pulse groupings and meter. And always try to notate things as efficiently as possible.

[Oh Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Land) \- The daughter of Danish organist Bendt Fabricius and opera singer Bodil Øland, Nanna Øland Fabricius - better known by her stage name Oh Land - writes and performs music that, quite honestly, is pretty damn hard for me to describe, as it takes influence from so many different genres, including pop, classical, dance, folk, jazz, and many more.  


Professional music reviewers can probably describe this strange but enchanting mix a lot better than I can, so I'll just post a few snippets from a couple reviews of her material:  


"Oh Land embraces the open-ended world of pop, creating an “anything goes” mix of club, dance, and nocturnal electro-pop. Like Lykke Li, she sometimes comes across like a flower child in a DJ booth, blissfully grafting together genres that may not be entirely compatible. But Oh Land’s combinations always work, whether she’s layering spoken word verses over disco beats on “Voodoo” or splitting the difference between Motown, tropicalia, and synth pop on “White Nights.”" -Andrew Leahey  


"Standouts like the string-laden "Doubt My Legs" and "Hot 'n Bothered" show off her penchant for mixing rich orchestrations with glitchy pop. With their strong, hooky choruses and quirky rhythms, they're right in her wheelhouse. Similarly, "Flags" marches to Oh Land's particularly strange drum, percolating with intricate rhythms and idiosyncratic backing vocals that probably wouldn't work if the song wasn't so damned catchy. Taking a more lonesome tack, the title cut floats along on a bed of hazy synths with distinct echoes of Goldfrapp as she reaches sweetly into her upper vocal register. Opening ballad "Machine" has a similarly attractive lost-in-space feel, building into the first of Earth Sick's many memorable choruses." -Timothy Monger  


FWIW, she also wrote what is probably my favorite song of all time: the spellbinding ballad *Frostbite*. I adore every single song she's ever released, but here's a quick playlist of some of my absolute favorites:

Some songs might have Phrygian passages, or maybe a whole verse, but otherwise it's pretty rare to be exclusively in Phrygian.

You will have to look to either true modal music, 20th century art music that uses modes (Debussy's String Quartet begins in Phrygian) or other cultural music where modes like that are a bigger deal.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-14 01:39:54 65TwinReverbRI<br>That's a great question and not one there's a solid answer for!

And unfortunately, it can also lead to the whole "major centric" approach.

So, if you wrote a piece or encountered a piece in A Dorian, it's very likely going to have a Key Signature (or let's call it "Mode Signature") of 1 sharp.

Now, truly, this should cause any issue because everyone *should* already know that any "Key" Signature can represent ONE OF TWO possible Keys (and there again is something a lot of people aren't taught or aren't taught to consider every time).

So when you start talking about modes, the "accidentals signature" could represent any 1 of 7 possible modes!

What makes it any particular mode - or key - is the music itself and what Center - or Tonic - it points to.

Again, we already do this all the time with Major and Minor so it's no different.

So Music Engravers, in an attempt to keep things simple and familiar, will often just use the "key" Signature of what the accidentals are because it's way easier to do - and I suppose on some level there's a hope that their audience understands modality, or, at last, those who would play from paper don't really need to understand it just to play the notes!

However, some people will in fact use the signature that puts it in the "tonic" (or Center)  - so a piece in A Dorian will have an A Minor (as its the closest) "key signature" and the F note will simply be altered throughout.

This is more common when there's more mode switching going on, just like moving from key to key or even Major to parallel minor in a traditional piece.

I would personally write a piece in C Phrygian with a "Mode Signature" of 4 flats, hoping the people who would play that type of piece would understand that it's not Ab Major but "in C" and thus C Phrygian. That is, if the piece were primarily or exclusively in C Phrygian.

Debussy's String Quartet "in G Minor" begins as G Phrygian and by contrast, begins with the Ab written in rather than in the signature - the Key Sig for the piece is Gm - 2 flats.

One can safely assume though that modality was a much newer thing then, and players would be more used to a piece "in G" as having a "G-based" key sign (either Gm or G major) and given the piece has plenty of chromatic notes already (as many more complex music does) putting the Ab in the key sig doesn't really save the engraver any time and the publisher any money, or the player any grief, so using the Gm key sig is fine.

One of the best ways to do this is to say in the piece's title: 
There are pieces actually stating the mode they're in somewhere in the title (in classical music, would be rare in pop).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-03 15:58:25 tdammers<br>Classical music theory is the music theory that attempts to describe the European Classical idiom(s). There are more idioms out there, and each of them deserves its own theory. Some things are universal, some things are common between many idioms, other things, not so much. There are music idioms that don't have tonal centers. There are idioms that aren't based on diatonic scales. There are idioms that don't have much of a notion of harmony at all.

Just a few examples that come to mind:

- Indian Classical. While each raga provides a tonal framework, and the "king" and "queen" notes (generally the root and the fifth) happen to show some similarities to the Western tonic and dominant, the music most definitely doesn't work that way - the raga provides not only a set of notes to play, but it also gives meaning to each (and that meaning changes with each raga, even if the tonal material is the same), it provides rules to guide melodic improvisation, and even tells you how to connect tonality with rhythms.
- Gregorian chant. There is no explicit harmony here, and while the melodies will often provide cycles of tension and relief, similar to classical cadences, the way it is done is very unlike classic harmony, there are more tonal modes than the relatively limited classical major/minor framework provides, and the role and function of each degree in the mode follow different rules than classic harmony.
- Folk traditions in the British Isles, particularly Scotland and Ireland. We do see major and minor scales here, with chords built on scale degrees and a tonal center, much like in European classic, but we also see modes other than classic major and minor, and the harmony doesn't necessarily follow a dominant-tonic pattern. We might, for example, see a harmonic progression like Am - C - G - Am, and while we can retrofit functional analysis on this, the truth is that it's just four chords from the same scale (A aeolian or dorian), the first one establishes a tonal center by merit of being the first (and last) one, and then we get a pattern that creates a cadence-like tension-relief cycle that is really just "home; not-home; also-not-home; home". Any two scale chords would work in the middle: "Am - D - Em - Am"; "Am - G - D - Am"; etc.

So, long story short: classical theory *is* a thing, it is the (or *a*) theoretical framework designed to explain the classical music idiom. It happens to have a lot of overlap with other related idioms, including modern pop music, but it is most definitely not identical with *all* music theory, and denying the fact that different theories are needed to explain different musical idioms is a bit harmful IMO.

For a very practical anecdotal example, I'll look back at a groove band I played in decades ago. We had a brand new 4-part horn section (2 trumpets, sax, trombone), and we were struggling to figure out voicings that sounded good. We had great horn lines, but we couldn't figure out how to arrange them. Why? Because we were too indoctrinated with classical and jazz theory. We tried to make complete chords with proper voice leading, and that just didn't work, because we weren't playing jazz. We needed fat, funky horn riffs with a punch. We should have done: 2nd trumpet plays melody, 1st trumpet doubles an octave above, tenor sax doubles octave below, trombone plays a parallel harmony voice (third above or below melody); and then make full chords in a few strategic spots, but more as an effect than anything. You wouldn't write like that for a smooth swing tune; you wouldn't write like that for a string quartet; but for this kind of music, this is how it's done. Different idiom, different ideals, different techniques, different theoretical framework (even though there's a lot of overlap: we were still playing in some relatively traditional key, we were using diatonic intervals, we had triad-based harmony, etc.).

Structurally it's a verse/chorus song that's had an episode tagged onto the verse/chorus structure. The individual bits aren't really related to one another that much though except that they occur in the same piece of music. That's often the case with verse/chorus songs - they're usually a juxtaposition of two completely unrelated ideas.  
  
The classical elements (in Genesis' music) aren't anything to do with the form of the piece, they're either the general idea that you could write longer pieces of music than the three minute pop song, or they're surface gestures - arpeggiated figures (e.g. the intro), use of orchestral-style playing with the Mellotron string patch (e.g. 5'36"), sort-of classical orchestral figures (keyboards 6'32"f), the odd reference to classical rhythms or chord changes (e.g. the opening of Watcher of the Skies) - that kind of thing. It's all impressionistic though, not usually a rigorous set of quotations.

There's relatively little thematic development within pieces, almost none across an album's worth of tracks, and even in things like The Lamb the internal references are limited to the odd reprise. Structurally it's more like musical theatre and less like opera.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-26 09:54:42 ZiegenKaiser<br>You need to train your ear to hear these sonorities, like the 7th chords, their alterations, and more importantly the common ways to string these chords together. Playing pop music by ear can seem easier. Often you’re only hearing simpler progressions within a single key, whereas in jazz, musicians frequently modulate around dominant function chords to create more tension and progression in a collection of chords.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-28 17:21:40 stereoroid<br>It’s not as if microtonality is anything new among “analog” musicians. You can hear it everywhere if you listen. The singer who sings a word a little flat for emotional effect, the guitarist with the subtle whammy bar  tweaks, the classical string section that sounds fuller because of natural tuning variations. If this is a reaction to the overuse of AutoTune, then I’m all for it, but it’s not really special. For example, have a listen to Kate Bush, who used her voice as a powerful instrument, her voice will sound all over the place if all you’ve heard before is over-produced pop.

I have a particular beef with guitarists who claim they’re “fixing” the guitar by installing frets at tweaked positions, and so on. A standard guitar is an equal temperament instrument, meaning that it will sound good enough in all keys. It’s a compromise, and if you look closely at any one key, it will be less than perfect. If you adjust the scale to better fit one key, you’re making it worse for another key. Which is fine if you understand that’s what you’re doing and are prepared to accept the results: just don’t claim you’re making the guitar better *overall* in the process. 

This is an area where virtual instruments can do things that physical instruments can not. In the Pianoteq software, for example, you can fine-tune every note for a key, save it, specify a different base key and the adjustments are transposed. Though I don’t think the complex timbres of a piano benefit from this as much as a synthesiser might.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-28 19:48:06 mrclay<br>It’s in a lot of major key pop songs with minor key borrowing. E.g. F - Fm6 - C. Well we know that middle chord is really iiø7 in 1st inversion. In a harmony vocal situation when A goes to Ab a singer on C will move to D almost instinctively.

A proper minor key iio - i I’ve definitely analyzed a few. At [1:35 in this well known modern string quartet](https://youtu.be/rVN1B-tUpgs?t=95), in Bb minor there’s the progression Ebm/Gb - Cdim/Eb - Bbm. While effectively this is a minor plagal sound I’m sure I’ve seen a lot more iio to i where the “i” is really a cadential 6-4 suspension on V. So like Bø7 - Am/E - E - Am. More examples escape me at the moment.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-11-06 10:14:17 65TwinReverbRI<br>Sound is energy - it's displacement - air pressure fluctuations - it's a "mechanical wave", meaning it physically displaces air molecules. In kind of a simple sense, it creates wind waves :-)

When a string vibrates - you've imparted energy into a string by plucking it (bowing, pizz, etc.) and causing it to vibrate, and that energy is transmitted through the air. Eventually it gets to our ear drums and causes them to vibrate as well.

So in sense, your eardrums are "sympathetically vibrating" with all kinds of sound waves all the time - they're physically reacting to the fluctuations in air pressure caused by the vibrating string (it's the same reason your ears pop when you change altitude - it's a change in air pressure, so they react to it - they're designed to react to very minute fluctuations).

Any object that is free to vibrate, will do so when energy is imparted to it. You can literally blow on a string and cause it to vibrate - but it's not a lot of energy right? So there won't be much volume.

Now, if you could sit down with your cello, and play a low C, and had another cello right next to it - the C string on it is going to vibrate a LOT - because not only is it free to vibrate, and it's getting air pressure changes from the string you're playing's sound waves ("blowing on the string so to speak), but it's a lot more energy in a bowed note at volume, and resonance comes into play - because it's the same frequency, more of the original energy is imparted to the other string.

Now, if you were to play a low D on your C string, it would also cause the open D on the other cello to vibrate - and that's because there's a D overtone in the lower D that is vibrating as well - and that imparts energy to the higher octave - it won't be as loud as the unison C notes, because there's less amplitude (about 1/2) but it still will impart energy.

Now it works in reverse too - playing a higher C can cause the overtone of the lower C to vibrate, but since that's "part" of the string (which is why we call overtones "Partials" as well) it has to make the whole string move - that's just physics :-)

But every vibrating object that makes sound produces physical air displacement that causes any other thing free to vibrate do so, but when the frequencies are the same or in correct proportions (resonance) it is able to "accumulate" more of the energy and vibrate freely itself.

And string instruments - where a string is fixed a both ends, actually create standing waves when they vibrate, which means the wave essentially bounces back on itself to make the amplitude higher - so the low C can kind of "self-oscillate" more easily - and more loud than you think it would under these conditions.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-11-10 04:31:34 65TwinReverbRI<br>Rock players - excepting those working in styles definitively linked to classical music - don't "use" voice-leading in the way it's meant in classical music. Or at least, as writers, they don't "implement" it or "think about it" in the same way.

For example, Voice-Leading is really about how each note in a chord moves to a note of the next chord.

In classical music, where very often a single instrument plays a single note of a chord - such as 4 vocalists each on a note of a chord - how each singer moves to their next note is "voice-leading" (hence the name).

When a guitarist strums a 4 string D chord then changes to a 6 string E chord (as what might happen in Norwegian Wood) they don't really think about it - or even care about it - it "just happens" because of the way a guitar is laid out. Or rather, "what happens happens" because if you play the standard "cowboy chord" shapes for D and E (or whatever) you don't really have any control over where the notes go - they kind of go where they have to go, and since it's going from 4 to 6, "extra" singers are suddenly added, or, two were singing one note before and then split off - which isn't what really happens on guitar.

Now, when we talk about the vocal harmonies in The Beatles, that's a more typical place to find voice-leading in action.

But it's questionable whether or not they were as concerned with where each note went - it their case it would mostly be "as long as it was a note of a chord and didn't double any other part" - though obviously The Beatles were generally more "composerly" about their harmonies than a lot of other groups (Because being a great example - but then, again, that approaches more "classical" composition, as do so many of George Martin's string arrangements, etc.).

I take "Voice-Leading" in Rock (or any pop genre for that matter) with a grain of salt.

It's not that it "isn't there" necessarily, but that it's more just a result of what happens, rather than carefully thought out like it is in contrapuntal music (and where classical music voice-leading stems from).

Now, all of that is not to say it can't be a useful thing to study and learn about, and for those instances where it is more intentionally used it can be helpful in analyzing it and recreating things like that yourself. IOW, George Martin certainly studied, and probably had a lot more influence than we know in sculpting Beatles vocal harmonies - and none of the Beatles themselves could have probably written the arrangements for all the horns and strings in most of the pieces (maybe McCartney could have come close at least later in life).

But simply put, it's not a "major component" of Rock music. It's not even a minor component. It's an afterthought in most cases, if it's a thought at all, except in specific situations.

As far as Modes are concerned, Mixolydian and Dorian are the two most commonplace and there is a ton of modal music as well as sections and interjections, so they're definitely good to understand.

But Phrygian and Lydian are pretty rare outside of a "hint" of them in a piece (and debatable to if they're even actually present in many cases). So they're not as big a deal to worry about.

I wouldn't worry about being "knowledgable" versus "expert".

I would say, that you know, you can use if you need to or want to. But if you don't know it, you can't use it even if you need to. So it's always better simply to learn as much as you can.

But, it's also helpful to have a "guide" as it were (a teacher) so you don't spend too much time on something you don't really need to know at all, or at least, initially. It's important to get the "core" stuff down - so, to be "competent" then move to "proficient".

But more importantly, to be that way *in the style of music you're interested in*.

IOW, don't spend months learning Counterpoint if you're interested in Rock music - it's simply not present in that way (or again, in any direct way where people are intentionally using it outside of particular situations) and it's not going to really help you "understand" the music all that much.

Instead, learning to play the songs, and just figuring out **what** it is you like (not "why" you like it) is going to be much more beneficial to you in the long run as a musician.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-11-19 14:43:05 65TwinReverbRI<br>Ok. The reason I asked is that usually with composition being able to play a "harmonic" instrument is important - Piano being the primary one, but guitar is not a bad substitute.

This is going to sound a bit harsh, but I want to throw out a little dose of reality here - I'm not saying this is exactly the position you're in - I don't have your entire musical training in front of me - but since I have a comp degree myself, and I see students coming into our program all the time, these are some "insights" I have:

Many people do come to composing "late" - that is, they've playing in band, orchestra, or choir since middle school, or taken piano in the same age range, and have starting writing their own stuff (or today, a lot of people are working in DAWs).

So very often, their composition experience is pretty limited coming in - very often there aren't even composition teachers where they live - sometimes a piano teacher is the best they can get.

Now, there's nothing wrong with that. But I would say that since you're a Junior now, you've essentially got 1.5 years to get your composing chops up to a good level to be able to get into the best school you can.

But I also want to caution, while anyone can take a composition degree for any reason - just to learn more about it for example - really, the "ideal" composition student is a person who just does little else than write music pretty much all the time. Or when they're not writing music, they're playing it, or working with people to play, and record, their music.

For example if we see a student come in from high school who's written a Piano an Violin duet, and had two friends play and record it, that's really impressive.

If we see a student come in with YASQ (yet another String Quartet) with no clue how to write for strings, who at best has a MIDI mockup of it which doesn't really  inform the person how real string players would play it, we're going to be less impressed. Now, we can't fault a person with fewer resources, but at the same time, a lot of people just don't take the initiative to do what they need to do.

IOW, they "dabble" in composition.

Music Degrees are actually very serious business. They're not for "dabblers". That's why so many people start in music performance, and then switch to music education. They find out that simply "liking playing violin in orchestra" is not enough to be a performance major. A Violin Performance major is for the person who lives and breathes everything Violin, and has realistic goals about what they want to do and is willing to work hard on how to get there.

Theory and Composition are no different, and in some ways even worse, because there are far fewer resources out there to get people early starts in those (though again, a later start is OK and even understood because of that, and because people should really spend their first years cultivating proficiency on an instrument).

Again, that's not to say you can't major in one of those degrees if you don't fit that profile - many people successfully complete the degree without that kind of investment. But they don't typically then put that degree to work for them.

There's another post hear tonight about Theory. I think the responses there will be very informative:

https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/dya47j/carrers_in_music_theory/

Your degree choice doesn't HAVE to be career motivated - again it can just be for general knowledge.

But, it's a lot of money to spend on that. And if it's not your money, you usually have some convincing to do :-)

Also, just FWIW, there's a lot of confusion out there about what "composing" is.

A Traditional Music Composition degree is going to focus on notated "classical" music - music for the concert stage meant generally to be performed by live performers. Many schools also include electronic music in this (not EDM, but "academic electronic music") but not so many of them consider "pop" music or even jazz as "composition". And very few consider "making beats" or anything like that to be "composing".

So it's very important to look at what kind of composition degree you want and what any school you're intending on attending offers/requires.

Ar my university, you'd have Voice as your major instrument, and you'd take even more Piano (4 semesters). You'd take 4 semesters of applied comp lessons, as well as the traditional theory/ear-training/history core, and then orchestration, counterpoint, form and analysis, etc. You'd also take Music Notation, Electronic Music, and Music Technology Survey.

The skillset a modern composer needs today is more varied than ever before, and there is or can be less emphasis on traditional orchestral composition, so things you can do to prepare if you're looking for a more diverse program:

Start composing every day. Lean to craft, and to hone. Learn that it's not all divine inspiration and there's a lot of work involved - a lot of drafts, sketches, rewrites, aborted ideas, and so on. The skill of composing is being able to craft something, not just write something on the first try (though sometimes that happens).

Start listening to the music you're planning to compose every day in any downtime when you can't compose. Learn as much classical repertoire as possible - every piano sonata by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, every symphony by Beethoven, and the later symphonies by Haydn and Mozart, , all their string quartets, all the "big name" things you hear about a lot - The Four Seasons, the Brandenburg Concerti, etc. - all the "greatest hits" - and then more. And do NOT not include modern music - you should be familiar with Debussy, Stravinsky, Bartok, all the way up to the moderns - Glass, Ligeti, etc. If you're into film music, now your rep - don't just go in with a knowledge of John Williams, or him and Howard Shore or something. Learn about Korngold, and Hermann, and all the other great film composers. If it's more slanted towards Jazz, then learn all your Big Band guys and the names of the great arrangers. Etc.

Learn to use Musecore, or Sibelius or Finale if you haven't already done so. If you have, learn them better. Notate all your stuff. A good looking, standardized, professional score is going to get more performances, have fewer mistakes in performance, and is going to be great on your resume and in your portfolio!

Learn some kind of Recording in a DAW - Pro Tools, Logic, even Garageband or Reaper. You should learn basic recording skills - you can sing duets, trios, or quartets by recording yourself - you don't need to master this (unless you're working towards a more DAW driven compositional style) but knowing how to record and being able to is going to help you hear what it is you're writing - especially if you can play it yourself or at least record others who can read through your music (in nice notation :-) for you.

Do take those piano lessons. But you need to get as much done as you can.

Same with voice lessons.

it wouldn't be a bad idea if you could ask your choir director if you could help with conducting sectionals, or if they wouldn't mind spending a little time teaching you how to direct a group of singers.

I would try to write a small piece or small set of pieces for a small group in your choir say 3 or 4 people you could get together that you can direct and have them perform your music.

If you don't have ideas for original music, or get stuck on a composition, don't be afraid to arrange other music - that's also a valuable learning tool (and inspirational one).

Honestly, while knowing some theory is great, we don't expect our incoming freshman to really know much beyond reading music, basic rhythm and pitch, key signatures and time signatures (most people coming in to college don't even know 6/8 is two beats per measure).

So the more you can do on this, great - if you can place out of some levels of theory you will be able to spend more time on other musical pursuits such as playing in additional ensembles.

But, I would spend the bulk of time on playing and writing, getting your notation, DAW, and piano skills up, and becoming the kind of vocalist that can pass a college entrance audition! 

I would say, by this summer, you should be seriously starting to work on your portfolio.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-11-24 00:27:46 Jongtr<br>No offence, but you need to get out more. :-)   

I mean, listen to a lot more music, of all kinds.  The intro is a standard line cliche, nothing original.  The song itself is an episodic piece of prog rock, partly inspired by the Incredible String Band, partly by blues, partly by bands like the Who and Cream.   

There's no doubting it's a classic of its kind, because of how it brought all those elements together, but I was a teenager in the 1960s, and I'd already heard so much great music - even just in pop and rock - before I heard Stairway, including most of the stuff that influenced it, so for me it was very much "meh".

Let "Stairway" be a gateway!  ;-)  It's great that you like it - that you don't think it's just a piece of old-fashioned hippie nonsense -  but if you think it's "perfect", there's a whole load of stuff out there - yes even in "mainstream" popular music - that will just blow your head open.

You're just *right*, not out of tune. :)

(says the string player/trad musician)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-11-27 16:37:41 Jongtr<br>&gt; I'd love to ask my teacher but am a bit embarrassed to do so is, what chords/keys are existential in nature? 

None - or all of them.  In any case, you first need to define "existential".  "Relating to existence" could mean anything at all.  "Existentialism" is a philosophy of free will; it's not really about the "meaning of existence".  I don't really think that's what you mean about the mood of that piece.  You mean it's meditative, reflective, it promotes introspection, and so on.

&gt;What is it about that song that made me question and appreciate life before the scene ever told me what I should feel? 

That would b entirely down to some personal association of yours.  What the piece does do, very successfully - as I said - is *make you think.*   That's *nothing to do with the mode or the chords.*  Almost nothing anyway.  It's everything to do with (a) the tempo (very slow); (b) the orchestration/arrangement (long high sustained notes on something like flutes or strings); (c) studio effects (reverb); (d) extreme simplicity of melodic material (long measured notes on piano); (e) absence of clear rhythmic pulse.   

The first minute or so sounds like the composer himself meditating, playing random notes, thinking about what note could follow.  Then you get a few chords creeping in, as if now he's forming a more complete thought in his mind.  Finally you get a more complete string arrangement, beginning to swell at 1:30, basses arriving to flesh it out.  Swelling strings are a classic device for evoking tearful emotion - you've seen that done in countless hollywood films, or accompanying countless sentimental lyrics.

In short, what you should ask your teacher is about this piece specifically, and how the composer achieves his effects.  Don't start from assumptions about individual elements such as chords or scales - whose effect is hugely exaggerated in popular myth.  

Your teacher is right *to some extent* about the effect of scale types in different genres, but it only really applies to variations in how much blues influence a genre has.  Genres like rock'n'roll (and rock in general) grew out of the blues.  Genres which have little or no blues influence (classical, folk, mainstream pop) all share the same scales, regardless of what mood individual pieces produce.  Jazz mixes classical scales (major and minor) with blues, and so does country music. (All American popular music does.)  The major scale can be used for "happy" and "sad" music alike, as can the minor scale.   "Dorian mode", e.g., could be used for something like "Any Other Name", but it's also used for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ATTjg7tpE). Spot any similarity? ;-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-11-28 02:07:29 tdammers<br>This is almost certainly because pop music and related guitar-heavy genres are grossly overrepresented in the sample, and these four keys just happen to be the most convenient ones on guitar; they're also convenient on the second most prominent instrument family in pop music, the keyboards.

If you were to sample other genres, you'd get different results. For example, marches and other wind band music will be biased towards Eb and Bb major. Chopin's work uses a lot of black keys, because that suits the playing style better. Jazz tunes are all over the place, but biased towards flats. String ensemble music is more likely to use sharps than flats due to the harmonic resonances of open strings. Irish folk music favors D major, because that is the most common tuning for the tin whistle. I could go on, but you get the idea.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-11-28 02:07:51 Scatcycle<br>There's going to be vastly different key tendencies for each genre of music. Piano, for example, benefits greatly from the use of many black notes; Db major is said to be the easiest key. In trap, one will generally pick keys around C-F as this is the range where most subwoofers excel and the bass will sound phat. In pop, you'll want to highlight your singer's voice, and keys may reflect the average natural tessitura of the human voice. 



Now, piano and trap pale in historical popularity compared to pop within the last 100 years. This is changing, but it will take a while for the stats to reflect that. It will be interesting to check these stats again in the future. As for whether it's a good or bad thing that the keys tend to center around simpler key signatures, it's probably not a maximization of potential, but that doesn't mean the songs would be better were they a different key signature. As pointed out earlier, certain songs will sound better in certain keys due to tessituras, or even things like open strings on string instruments. There's a reason Adagio for Strings is in Bb minor. This means that people may be missing out on these small nuances because they fear reading dealing with a key signature that has Lots of flats or even double sharped notes. The key is that they probably would have played worse on this difficult key anyway, stagnating their creativity and ruining songs. So, it's good that they chose a key that works for them. It might not be the best possible, but it's the best they can do.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-12-05 12:35:34 peduxe<br>

that half diminished chord is one of my favorite chords, lots of indie pop/rock songs uses them - most common fingering is (x10.11.10.11x - Gm7b5) root on A string and is a movable shape.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-12-15 01:27:53 65TwinReverbRI<br>In functional harmony, which implies CPP practices, an + Triad resolves two primary ways:

C - C+ - Am/C - in this example there is chromatic upward motion from the note G to G# to A.

G+ - C, or more commonly, G+/B to C.

In this case the + chord is an "altered dominant" and again there is chromatic voice-leading:

G - G

D# - E

B - C

Notice how both the 3rd and the raised 5th of the V chord move up a half step to the notes of the I chord.

These are often used a secondary dominants as well:

C - C+/E - F

To re-orient this, it's actually similar to the first one, except that the 3rd of the first chord moves up to the root of the 2nd. Compare:

G - G# - A

E - E - E

C - C - C

with

G - G# - A

E - E - **F**

C - C - C

However the 2nd one doesn't happen commonly in that position because it produces a 2nd inversion triad which would  only be found in rather specific contexts.

In the "pop" world, it's still common to find + chords that resolve as V+ to I without the voice-leading considerations.

It's commonly found in Blues-based pop songs where it acts as a turn-around chord to lead back to the I. Famous examples are the intro to "No Particular Place to Go" by Chuck Berry, and the more typical example in "Oh Darling" by The Beatles.

The other most common pop use isn't really a "resolution" at all, but is created either by "Line Cliché" motion or a m3 or blue note:

Cm - "Eb+" - Eb/Bb - Am7b5 - Abmaj7 - etc.

This is the "Chim Chim Cher-ee" progression.

Often the chord above remains Cm so it's Cm - Cm/B - Cm/Bb - Cm/A, etc. - basically a static Cm chord with the bass line descending chromatically.

But it is sometimes just the 3rd and 5th of the i chord - Eb and G in this case. That would spell (in this key) Eb-G-B making an Eb+ chord.

But really, it's kind of "not really" an Eb+, just some chord we *are able to give a name* that is produced by this chromatic motion.

Note that this is one of the few examples where an + chord moves to (or from) a **minor** Triad (however, again it's not really "resolving" in that sense, just *resultant of* chromatic motion.

[side note, the same can be said about my very first example and in so many contexts that  I+ triad moving to vi^6 goes by so quickly or with such little emphasis that it's just considered resultant of voice-leading or the G# (in C) is just considered a chromatic passing tone, and again, basically non-functional harmony, if a "chord" at all]

Another common pop move - again in minor - is to have the m3 of the key, such as Eb in Cm, over the V chord - so G Major with a b3 on top (G-B-Eb, again making what looks like a bIII+ or Eb+/G but really isn't) and that b3 resolves melodically down to scale degree 1 like so:

Eb - C

B - C

G - C

This can be heard in "Stray Cat Strut" by The Stray Cats (though IIRC it's a G7#5 but the principle is still the same) though in typical pop fashion the voice-leading is only important in the melody line.

The other major pop use is also the line cliché not unlike my very first example and sort of the opposite of the "Chim Chim Cher-ee" example, where it's an upper note in the chord that is moving up/down (instead of the bass note). Happens in "String of Pearls" by Glen Miller:

C - Cmaj7 - C7 - C6 - C+ - C then up the same way.

This just involves the chromatic line C-B-Bb-A-G#-G over the static C harmony.

So again, "non functional" and arising through chromatic motion, which is pretty much how all + triads arise; it's just that when they produce an *augmented dominant* chord that resolves to I (not i!) do we see it as functional and a "resolution" per se.

Hope that helps.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-12-16 17:26:45 JoeDoherty_Music<br>Ok:
I am assuming you're trying to write something medieval sounding, like a fantasy video game or movie. (Like something you might hear in lord of the rings or skyrim)

First off! Listen to music that evokes that feeling for you. This just sounds like trap with medieval sounding midi instruments. Especially listen to just regular classical music too. They just *don't* use rhythms like that. Study how the music flows and is structured. Modern music has a very different song structure than songs from 300-500+ years ago. I also recommend the Elder Scrolls Oblivion soundtrack. 


Also keep in mind that what we call medieval music is really just music based in classical music and/or renaissance music. So a lot of what you study should really be looking at classical music and renaissance music. 


They didnt have hip hop drum beats 500 years ago. Percussion in classical music was much more free flowy and less organized unless it was a simple continuous rhythm, usually on one drum (I am generalizing here but they definitely didn't have your typical kick snare kick snare pattern)  the drum set didnt exist. Generally one person per drum. The percussion was used to accentuate the music, rather than to push the music forward as in rap, rock, and pop. So I would recommend deleting the drums you have and add in a marching snare kinda thing and see where that takes you. Remember, no drum set. Crash cymbals were played like those monkey toys, one person, one cymbal in each hand, not on a metal stand. Hi hat didnt exist, the clicking might have been done by clicking the two cymbals together. Bass drum was used more sparingly (think big open notes rather than groovy beats)


The intro is very pizzicato (short, quick notes) this is usually used less in this kind of epic fantasy music. If it is used, it wont be a simple repeating pattern like this. It'd probably be a longer melody with more note diversity, not just "the same melody but with a slightly different ending". It would also have more of a pretty feel, like the middle of the skyrim theme song for example, where it drops down and you hear that delicate melody.


Use lots of long string notes. Have a cello just hold a note for a whole bar. Use it to add tension and release to the melody. 


Also use the humanize feature in your DAW if you have one. You're trying to emulate music played by humans, and 5 different string players dont all start playing their notes of the chord at the exact same time. Turn off the clamp-to-grid tool and adjust the notes a tiny bit. Maybe even have them build slowly together, or have them stagger the chord.


So anyways I hope this helps. Its 1am and I'm not an expert but I am a songwriter and musician, and really like that epic fantasy music stuff and have studied it quite a bit. This song sounds like you listen to too much rap and not enough of the music you're trying to write. While this could be an awesome rap song, it isn't doing what you are trying to accomplish, and I think some of what I've said here will help you wrap your head around the concept better. 

Good luck
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-12-20 23:15:44 Jongtr<br>Let's fix those enharmonics to start with (and a couple of other things):

Ebmaj7 - F/E - Gbmaj7 - Fmaj7 - Ebmaj7 - Ebmaj7#11 - Dm - Ddim7

F/E is the weird chord: is that really what you meant?  Aside from that, it seems to be in Eb major, the final chord being the vii ("leading tone chord", borrowed from Eb minor) taking you back to the beginning.   

Obviously the Gbmaj7 and Fmaj7 don't come from that key (let alone the "F/E"), but they're a great illustration of the principle that "a chord can follow any other of the same type" (regardless of key) - a rule which works especially well with maj7s.     

Ebmaj7#11 and Dm have an A natural, of course, which could either point to Eb lydian mode (on those two anyway), or simply to the key not being Eb after all.  It seems to be one of those kinds of sequence which are extremely common in contemporary pop (especially in R&amp;B or hip-hop), which consist of a string of chords in which none of them really *sounds* like a key chord - even when the chords all share a scale, and of course they don't here.  The whole idea is to avoid a cadence, to keep the sequence looping, rootless, "up in the air".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-12-21 22:32:29 SkyhouseStudio<br>Voice-leading and counterpoint are the music theory terms for how make multiple melodic lines maintain independence and sound like distinct melodies. They are big and complex topics that are well-worth studying. But you can also use less-formal instrumentation, orchestration, arrangement, and production choices to help achieve certain effects. 

For example, big, sustained, extended chords behind the melody can be a great role for things like hammond organ, string sections, choir, synth pads, etc. 

Alternately, with "chimier" or more dynamic instruments such as acoustic guitar, piano, pitched percussion, harp, etc, it is pretty common to voice full-range accompaniment as repeating arpeggiated patterns. This helps a fluid, lyrical melody line to sit "on top" of the rigid triplet pattern or whatever. 

The place where you tend to run into trouble is when a guitar or piano is plunking out quarter-note chords over an eighth-note melody... the melody tends to kind of melt into the chord and make it sound like you're just changing chord voicings (which can actually be a really cool effect, if it's the one you're looking for).

The terms for these things are: 

- voice-leading: the subset of music theory dedicated to the study of how chords and melodies interact. Looking at all the notes being played by all the instruments, and how they move through a whole harmonic and melodic sequence.

- counterpoint: sort of the "OG" original voice-leading, specifically going back to choral music, and specifically dedicated to maintaining voice-independence. "Counterpoint" tends to imply that one is following the best and most formal rules of voice-leading, while "voice leading" can imply simply the study of what's going on in a rock or pop song, for example. 

- Instrumentation: what instruments are in the thing, what they are doing, and what their roles are. 

- Arrangement: related to all the above, the high-level decisions about whether this piece will be a simple voice-and-piano song, or a New-Orleans style ragtime jazz version with brass and marching drums, or a lavish pop production with strings and rock instruments and a gospel choir, etc. It's both about instruments and also stylistic choices.

- Orchestration - kind of the more-formal study of instrumentation and arrangement, especially oriented towards a traditional western orchestra with SATB sections for strings, brass, and wind, plus percussion. Incorporates counterpoint and voice-leading, and also factors like tambre, loudness, and useful ranges of various instruments. 

Hope that helps.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-01-01 18:46:18 Jongtr<br>It keeps the beat, essentially.  It does that in groups which have no drums (such as early hot jazz and string bands), and sometimes no bass either.   I just posted [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANArGmr74u4&amp;t=90) on another question, and it's a great example of early rhythm guitar.  Notice all three guitars play rhythm to start with, backing the violin, before Django plays the lead solo.

Its simplest role is to hit the chords on each beat. Normally it also provides accents to convey the metre (time signature).  So it doesn't just hit every beat the same way, it will accent some more than others, and may play some chords long and some short (staccato or muted).  In pop, rock and jazz, beats 2 and 4 are generally hit louder and shorter than beats 1 and 3.   Sometimes, the rhythm guitar attempts to mimic the sound of the drums and bass together, by playing bass notes on beats 1 and 3 and short percussive chords on 2 and 4 to emulate the snare drum. (You hear that, to some extent, in the above track.)

In early rock'n'roll, the rhythm guitar was typically an acoustic, played by the singer (such as Elvis) while an electric guitar played fills or solos.  This rhythm would be very similar to the early jazz rhythm style.  The bass would also usually be an acoustic double-bass.

Then bands like the Crickets, Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps, and the Shadows in the UK, established the now standard rock band line-up of two electric guitars (lead and rhythm), electric bass and drums - followed by the Beatles and Stones, of course, and most bands since.  The [Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoN6AKPGkBo) in particular maintained a very distinct separation of lead and rhythm duties (notice the electric rhythm guitar has a very clean "acoustic" sound - this is 1969, but they are miming to the 1960 original).

Other times, the rhythm guitar can play a distinctive riff or rhythmic pattern. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeZHB3ozglQ) a classic.  Notice he also plays the occasional "lead" part (high on the neck).  He also has a second rhythm guitar in support, but you can barely hear her! In the second tune (2:00) he plays some lead guitar lines, but again he's mostly playing his signature rhythmic riff.

Many rock bands only had one guitar (with bass and drums), so the player would combine both roles: mostly strumming chords (sometimes with rhythmic riffs) behind the vocal, but playing lead solos in the breaks - supported only by bass and drums, but sometimes by overdubbed rhythm guitar.  Examples: Jimi Hendrix, the Who, Cream, Police, Z Z Top, Nirvana.    Here's [Pete Townshend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXU0GvtOTH0) inventing a new kind of combined rhythm and lead.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-01-02 23:04:24 Jongtr<br>It looks like you only have root notes, not chords as such.   You're quite right those notes could fit a few different modes, because you have no 3rd, 6th or 7th.  The only modes your notes won't fit are phrygian, lydian and locrian.

You're also right that "perfect" is not quite the right word!   The 4th and 5th (frets 5 and 7) are perfect intervals relative to the C# keynote, while the 2nd (fret 2) is a "major 2nd".   That's the one that rules out phrygian, while your perfect 5th rules out locrian, and the perfect 4th rules out lydian.

That still leaves you with all the *most common* modes in western music.  I'll give the scale degree frets on your 6th string, for comparison with what you've got:

Major key / Ionian mode: 0-2-4-5-7-9-11-12

Natural minor / Aeolian mode: 0-2-3-5-7-8-10-12

Mixolydian mode: 0-2-4-5-7-9-10-12

Dorian mode: 0-2-3-5-7-9-10-12

It's also very common (at least in rock and pop) for these modes to be *mixed.*   IOW, there is no need to stick with any one of those scales, unless you really want to.  You may find you like one of them, or you like some combination of two or more, or one of them with an occasional variation.  All cool!

Remember the minor key scale can have variable 6th and 7th degrees.  So if you pick Aeolian, frets 9 and 11 are as open to you as frets 8 and 10.

There is also blues scale, which means these frets on your 6th string:

Blues scale: 0-3-5-6-7-10-12.

That often gets mixed in with dorian and mixolydian,

And this is a very efficient thing, because you also learn to read music, which unlocks all kinds of valuable knowledge (and is a skill that is sorely neglected by the vast majority of guitarists).   

I recommend going through the Hal Leonard Guitar Method books, as well as the various accessory books (Easy Pop Melodies, etc).   If one goes through these books, I think it is very helpful and worthwhile to go through them multiple times, relearning the pieces at higher fretboard positions or at higher octaves (whatever is applicable).  

 It is also fun and rewarding to learn some classical guitar going through various method books for that, as well, and then perhaps learning solo arrangements of famous recent music (Hal Leonard has a great Fingerpicking Beatles book, for example).   

But yeah, reading music forces you to learn the fretboard.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-01-13 16:42:59 tdammers<br>Two important things to understand:

1. **Music theory was developed as a means to an end.** That end is either analytical (for the musicologist) or as "cookbook recipes" (for the working musician), and if either of those is your goal, then learning the theory will come naturally. That's because you're respecting the "Problem Solution Ordering" (look it up if you've never heard about it, it'll change your world). Unfortunately, music education has a knack for ruining that, the motivation for learning theory often being "because it's on the curriculum".
2. **Music theory is relative.** There is no single universal theory of music that is also completely specific. Each specific theory applies to a relatively small set of musical idioms, and the theories typically taught in music ed describe the so-called "Common Practice Period" idioms (roughly baroque through romantic eras), and idioms derived from it to varying degrees. Extensions to that theory have been developed that accurately describe jazz and related genres, approximately up to and including hardbop (but excluding modal jazz and most modern fusion genres). And as long as those idioms are your area of interest, these theories can be very helpful in absorbing the idiom more quickly. If your interests lie elsewhere, you need to use different theories. Using Riemann analysis on Palestrina's work is nonsensical. Using Roman Numeral analysis to figure our 12-tone music is ridiculous. Analyzing modal jazz using a dominant-tonic framework isn't very helpful. Unfortunately, music education programs typically teach only one or two theories, all of them more or less based on CPP music, and present them as "the" theory of music, leading to pain and frustration when you try to write interesting contemporary music with them, or apply them to pop music and end up with something horribly complex and uninformative.

So, what do?

First of all, meditate on the two facts above. That theory can't explain *all* music, so maybe you need to lower your expectations in that regard.

Second, and most importantly, if your teachers fail to make a strong enough connection to the practice, or provide a wider range of theoretical frameworks, you will have to do it yourself. Things you can do:

- **Play all the exercises** and examples from your theory lessons on the piano.
- Try to **solve some of your homework assignments by ear**: find a solution that sounds idiomatic on the piano, write it down, and *then* check whether it fits the rules. If not, try again. This will take longer, but it will help develop an intuition for the idiom.
- **Find idiomatic music and analyze it.** Try to figure things out by ear first: where's the tonic, where is the dominant, how does it all develop; pick one voice and follow it through, how it progresses, how it relates to the harmony, etc. Start with works from the Viennese Classical period, then work your way through the Romantic era; string quartet and mixed choir are a great formats, because they are probably the closest to the idealized four-part homogenous ensemble you study in your theory classes, and instrumentation and instrument technique are not usually very prominent factors.
- **Write music for real ensembles** that you have access to. There is no substitute for hearing your music played "for real". If you don't have any ensemble to perform your music, start one. Even if it's just a bunch of fellow students forming an a cappella group.
- **Study other idioms as well.** For many of those, no formal theoretical frameworks exist, or only rudimentary ones, but that doesn't make them less useful. It just means you have to figure out their rules by yourself. Others, like for example the polyphonic style of the Roman School (most notably Palestrina), have been studied extensively, and theoretical frameworks and didactic works covering the idiom have been around for centuries.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-01-18 01:29:30 Jongtr<br>This is a common myth - largely, but not wholly true.

Paul McCartney's father was a jazz band musician.   Paul had a few lessons on piano and trumpet as a boy, but didn't really get on with them, and never really learned to read music.  But clearly (partly thanks to his father and his record collection probably) he developed a really good ear.   As a teenager, he and George Harrison (a schoolfriend) had some guitar lessons - enough to develop a good knowledge of basic chords.   Those lessons included some classical guitar (they both learned Bach's Bourree in E minor, at least to some extent), and a touch of jazz.  But little or no theory.   Their teacher, Jim Gretty, showed them the 7#9 chord, but didn't explain it to them - so they called it "the Gretty chord" from then on.  (Used it eventually on Michelle and Taxman, before Hendrix got hold of it.)

John Lennon was taught some banjo by his mother, and taught himself harmonica.  But those were only ever informal lessons.  But he also developed a good ear.

When the three of them first got together (aged 15-16), they found they were good at 3-part vocal harmonies.  They all had good ears and voices.  Mainly, of course, they were obsessed with rock'n'roll, and learned all the songs they could get hold of.  That would have been almost entirely by ear, although they would have shared knowledge of chords and so on with fellow musicians.    Paul McCartney has said how he and George used to have to show John guitar chords, because most of his were based on banjo chords.   

Their real education was their stint playing in Hamburg bars, where they had to add dozens, maybe 100s of new songs to their repertoire to keep audiences (and themselves) entertained through the long working hours.  

In short, they were working, and learning countless songs, for around five years (1957-62) before Brian Epstein discovered them and got them signed.   They really did learn a phenomenal quantity of songs (literally 100s).  They - at least Paul - were writing songs from an early age, but they basically learned everything they knew from all the songs they covered.  Not only rock'n'roll and pop, but a handful of old jazz standards, musical show tunes, country tune, blues, the odd folk song, and so on.  No one else at that time had such a broad range of influence, so much hunger for influence, nor so much experimental self-confidence.  They had no sense that there was anything you *couldn't* do.   On top of that was the friendly rivalry between John and Paul, as each wanted to impress the other with their songwriting - so they were upping their game all the time.

George Martin naturally played a role in polishing their songs - suggesting changes to form occasionally to improve impact (such as playing Please Please Me faster, or starting Can't Buy Me Love on the chorus) but played no part in the songwriting.   Even things like horn and string arrangements would be largely dictated by Paul, and Martin would notate them for the session musicians.

Popular music ultimately stemmed from European “hausmusik” (which is exactly what it looks like). Then the Spanish guitar was introduced to the new world and was readily adopted by the vaqueros of the American Southwest/Mexican North. In both scenarios, the music was specifically designed to be both pleasing and not difficult for a non-virtuoso to replicate. 

Plenty of pop piano tunes in Bb and F, plenty of pop guitar tunes in A and E, but not a whole lot of cross over (too many bar chords on guitar in Bb and F; too many black keys in A and E). G and D are equally agreeable on both instruments, so you hear a TON of pop music in those keys.

F#m is quite common - Another Thing Coming, Flight of Icarus, Radar Love, Mr. Scary, just a couple I can name off the top of my head.

F#m is GREAT because the common use of bIII and bVII in rock give you open A and E chords. Also the F#m scale down there uses open E, F#, G# on the E string and open A, B, and C# on the A string, and open D, E, and F# on the D string which presents a wealth of opportunities for pull-off and hammer on type riffing using the open strings.

DOA by Van Halen, Winds of Change by Guadalcanal Diary, Lightning Strikes by Ozzy, I'm sure I could think of some more given more time. Oh, Don't Tell Me You Love Me by Night Ranger.Ooh La La (Paris) by Grace Potter. Hold the Line by Toto.Jailbreak by Thin Lizzy.

What's happening here is the OP just simply isn't familiar (enough) with songs that use a lot of different keys and/or maybe just guitar-oriented music in general - which is not the sole determining factor of music keys - but in a lot of pop made by keyboardists it's probably not as common as Am or Em or Dm, etc.

A Major is pretty common too. Just another example of not being familiar enough with enough songs or only being familiar with songs from the last couple of years or something...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-07 11:17:22 Rockhoven<br>Basics: I say basics because you say you don't know anything. All theory is rooted in the history of music. Blues was first sung and then played on simple one stringed instruments. Imagine you're singing one line, and imagine your vocal cords as one linear line, which in fact they are. Also a one stringed instrument can be imagined as a single line. Then the intervals can be any where on that line. From culture to culture, this can vary substantially. So, in African culture the 3rd can be between the minor 3rd and the major 3rd rather than directly on our versions of those tones or intervals. So on a piano you either will not get that interval or you'll have to do a makeshift imitation of it like playing both the M3 and m3 at once. This suggests the note between those two.

On a non-fretted instrument such as a single string African berimbau (actually a Brazilian instrument with African origins) Well, I'm not going to pretend to know anything about a berimbau though it's likely that I have played one in my visits to Brasil. I'm just looking it up on the web and immediately recognized it as an instrument familiar to me, one I have probably played and if not, I can easily see that it's a percussion instrument but that the pitch could be raised by shortening the string with a thumb or better yet a bottle or slide.

Now there are no frets so I can get that interval that I just mentioned. A Brazilian would do that just by ear without any need for the frets as a cue. Lowering that note to a true m3 or raising it to a M3 might be totally unacceptable to the natives! They might say you were out of tune. Because, historically speaking, intonation is strictly a cultural thing. Or was until modern times when so much music is heard through mass media.

Guitar players will play an E major chord in the rhythm and the lead player will play an E minor pentatonic scale over that. That's what people are referring to as a "clash" of sorts. It's this kind of technique that put the Blues on the map of pop music and it's likely to continue influencing music in this century even though what we hear is not sounding "bluesy" anymore. Of course, then there is the slide guitar.

Most of the early blues players took up traditional western musical instruments in the Americas - piano, fretted banjos and guitars and adapted the techniques for blues. The banjo is really of African origins in the first place. Don't know if it had frets. The equal tempered system that developed out of Bach's time and thereafter required frets on some instruments. The piano works the same way with each key on the keyboard divided according to whatever it is today - I call  it equal temperment - the tempered system has gone through some changes along the way.

Now you will hear some say that the blues is a feeling. The blues is a mode or set of modes that developed out of the African placement of intervals. You can hear the natural sound of the scales on field recordings made in the 20th century. Then when it was adapted to Western instruments and used in conjunction with the tempered system and on Western designed instruments, that African music became the blues and also jazz and rock &amp; roll and continued to influence heavy metal, reggae, punk and hip hop.

Many of the progressions first heard in the early blues can still be heard in hip hop - yet we don't hear them as bluesy. Modulations in some Ramones songs could not have come into being without first having the existence of blues, in my opinion.

As far as learning the blues from a classical background, it can be done, but you have to learn the blues scales and techniques just as you learn the keys and modes and classical techniques. But you have to keep an open mind. The classic progression of I IV V I is common to the blues. But the blues introduced the I V IV I progression which is, or was, taboo in classical theory! But if you know how to use it, the sound is good.

Start with some basic  minor and major pentatonic scales. Then learn where the blue notes are. Don't get hung up on the spellings of these scales. Though the addition of the blue notes to five tone scales technically rendered a six tone scale, I am pretty sure that this is an incorrect analysis. The six tones in a blues scale should be interpreted as suggesting a five tone scale with a tone that is not in the tempered system. The blue notes do not actually exist on a tempered instrument.

I'll use this example from another poster  1 - 3b - 4 - 4# - 5 - 7b . It can be used as is adapted to Western instruments, but I doubt that the origin of this sequence would lead us to interpret this sequence as a six toned scale. 4 - 4# - 5 might be suggestive of some other note or interval that can not be found on our tempered instrument. You'd have to use a slide on a string to find it. It might be two blue notes in the space of those three notes. It's unlikely, to me, that there are actually three notes there in the span of that space.

     C A C A
C: I V/ii I V/ii

Until you move to the C#m; it makes more sense to analyze that chord in A. In this case A is its own pivot chord:

    C  A C  A  C#m
C: I V/ii C V/ii ?
             
————A: I  iii

After this, all the chords fit into in Gb or Ebm. Minor chords prevail and Bowie focuses on the notes Gb and F, so it sounds to me like Ebm. but C#m/Dbm doesn’t really fit there. We can analyze it in relation to the Abm chord, though; Dbm is the iv chord in Ab minor, and Abm is the iv chord in Ebm. So you can view Dbm as secondary a iv/iv. so it is pivoting us away from A and towards Abm and Ebm.

          Dbm Abm Cb Ebm
A:       iii

Ebm:  iv/iv  iv      bVI  i

Afterwards, you get a string of Bbm and Db chords- v and bVII in Eb. at some point the Bb chords (V) become major, which strongly pulls to Eb. This is a cool example of dominant prolongation in pop music, which is used to build tension (which is also what the musicians seem to be doing). Interestingly, this never seems to resolve to Eb- for a moment, a guitar riff suggests a resolution to C minor, which would be an example of a tritone sub (Db7 - Cm), but that Cm quickly drops down to a Cb chord and continues our Ebm tonality.

Moral of the story: If you want to modulate to a weird place smoothly, keep adding weird accidentals.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-13 02:08:48 goodgamin<br>From a strictly theory point of view, this is not complex. The chords are moving fairly slowly, and they're not unusual chords. 

A study of basic classical harmony will get you there. Learn diatonic chords. If you just learn that, and how they sound when you string them together into different chord progressions, you'll be more than half way to understanding this music.

One thing about music: sometimes a composer — whether it's classical or pop or cinematic, or whatever — hits on an amazing combination of melody, harmony, rhythm and tempo, and then magic happens. There's no formula for it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-20 23:36:09 ILoveKombucha<br>I'm curious if you can imagine the sound you would make if you played a familiar pattern.    I bet you have internalized more sounds than you think.   But you have to spend time exercising that mental ear.   

If you haven't internalized any sounds, I would think it's because you aren't staying focused on what you are playing.   For instance, it is very helpful to be focused on how the note you are playing relates to the diatonic background (the key) as well as to the chord of the moment.   (Ie, C is 1 in the C major scale, but 3 on the Am chord).   Thinking this way will help you internalize the sounds that you are playing.

Beyond that, practicing singing a lot is very helpful.   Same thing here: you are trying to internalize sounds.   Start with scales and arpeggios (always being aware of what degree you are singing within a given scale and chord).   Then start practicing singing against a drone as TheJayField suggests.   Sing over a single chord.   Then start singing over common diatonic chord progressions (what you find in many pop/rock songs).   Gradually broaden your vocabulary.

I think it is super critical to be mindful of what you are doing.   You can ear train on an instrument, but you have to be very mindful and not rely on muscle memory.

But again, I bet there is a good chance you've internalized some of those sounds associated with muscle memory.   Try imagining your fingers moving around the fretboard, and see if you can't imagine what that sounds like.   As you do that, try to be aware of WHAT you are playing - not just fret/string, but key/chord/scale degree.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-23 18:50:42 Jongtr<br>John Lennon was once bemused when he was told his songs used "Aeolian cadences".  Did it matter that he didn't know what they were?  He certainly knew the chords he was using, and chose them because he knew the sound he wanted.  Who cares if he didn't know the academic jargon?

Like your intuition about the tower, pop songwriters use their intuition about what sounds good.  In fact, they use their ears, same as you (hypothetically) used your sense of balance and judgement about weight distribution when looking at that tower.  You don't have to know the formula for gravity to feel how it works.  You don't have to understand physics to throw a ball so someone can catch it.

That's aside from the fact the music is an *artform*, it's not about physical laws.  Sound itself is about laws of physics of course, but music is about specific cultural choices of sounds, and specific organisation of those choices.   
Music theory certainly deals with those cultural choices (not the physics).  It can also help musicians make music by teaching them the common formulas that "work".  
But musicians can also learn those formulas by ear, by copying the sounds they like.  
 
Successful musicians in any genre are *thoroughly* "in tune with their music" as you put it.  At least they're as in tune as they have to be.  The fact that you could describe what they do in theoretical terms they would be ignorant of doesn't make you *more* "in tune with their music."  You're just more "in tune" with theory.  

Think about the primitive hunter who kills game with a bow and arrow.  Does he need to go to college to learn the physics of gravity, momentum, string tension, air friction, etc.? Obviously not.  He learns the skills through practice.  Pop (and folk and blues) musicians are much the same.  You learn that stuff *by doing it*, not by reading about how to do it.

KoRn, Linkin Park, Papa Roach etc. My friend got a guitar for one christmas, and so it just made sense that I got a bass, right!? 

Turns out he wasn't very good and we fell out over it, but for once I'd found something I was really really great at. For most of my life, i'd just been like average at things. I basically sacked off all my school work (GCSEs) and played bass for 10-15hours a day for a couple of years, taught myself basic theory, and learnt about recording using my computer (I was obsessed with computers before music got me) and then went to college to do A-Levels in Music and Music Technology, and straight to university after to do a Jazz/Pop B.Mus. This was really important for me as it got me away from the total shit hole of a town I was living, and into a bigger city. I was very very young, perhaps too young as I just turned 18 less than a month before the course started, after only having known what music really was for 3 years, but I was HUNGRY and so I ate it all up.

In the second year of the degree, I started teaching privately. I also got a crappy part-time job in a supermarket. However, I was in the game. I had around 7 students a week.

Third year was much the same, but we'd also landed a little restaurant gig playing jazz standards as a bass/guitar duo. The pay was crappy but we were happy to be out twice a week practicing our chops. My friend basically convinced the owner of the restaurant to put us on. I was actually a good jazz player back then haha, practicing for 3 hours twice a week was really good for me. I'd voice the chords and walk on 6 string bass, and guitar would play melody. That's when I really started learning.

So, graduation arrives. Out in the big bad world, and I'm definitely not leaving the city. I have around 10 private students a week, still working the supermarket, and have the little jazz gig in the restaurant. I'm also doing small recording jobs on the side from my home studio, and some on-location recordings for friends. For the next year I just worked my way out of my overdraft, and around a year after that I took the plunge to leave my supermarket job... This was it, the turning point. I'm gonna be a real musician!!

I was very lucky that I left the supermarket job, and overnight I just started getting a lot more student enquiries. I also landed my first job as an engineer in a studio. I was in the right place at the right time. I took a band in to record some drums, get talking to the engineer and he says he's thinking of leaving, so to send the track when it's finished. Send the track, get the job. Honestly maybe if i'd gone there a different day that would never have happened.

As you're starting to see, it's a smorgasbord of work and good fortune that starts to make your 'career'. I also at the same time, landed some teaching for a local music school, again through a friend I met at a party who said her boss was looking for a guitar tutor. I also joined a wedding band, and started gigging more regularly. Most weekends, the money was good and it was fun. Back then I really was burning the candle at both ends. Teaching Saturdays 12-5, then going out to a gig, getting back at 3am and then in the studio all day Sunday from 10am til 6pm. Honestly looking back at it, not sure how I managed it! 

A couple of years on from that, I got work at two more studios as engineer, one at the best studio in the city. A huge studio with an SSL desk, and the most ridiculous amount of gear ever. However, the pay in recording studios is absolutely shocking. Less than half what I would make teaching privately for an hour. But that was one of my favourite things, making recordings so I stuck with it ever since, eventually my name being handed around people who wanted to record.

Over the years playing and teaching, you meet more people and more opportunities just sort of show themselves. The wedding band eventually folded, and so now I just dep for other bands who need a bass player at short notice as I've met so many other bands and players. I've worked on post-production for global TV, written soundtracks for computer games, produced music played all over the world on radio and tv, delivered songwriting and production workshops around Europe as well for corporate teambuilding days, MD'd a theatre show, I've done live sound for shows as well on rare occasions (basically, there's only one band I'll do it for, a 18pc jazz big band) as I really don't enjoy it usually! Probably some other crazy things that I can't think of right now.

Nowadays, I still teach mon-thurs from around 3pm til 8pm, and do a lot more private production work, from my home studio around that, and still occasionally engineer for the studios in the city but I refuse to cancel my better paid work to do it so a lot of sessions I can't make. I've just had my first son, and I'd rather work from home if I can. So i'm not gigging much at the moment (I'm lucky enough to basically say no unless it pays well enough)

I've been full time since 2011, and part time music since 2009. Wouldn't change it for anything. It can be hard going with this feeling over your head that it could just disappear overnight, but I'm still here :) Never had a penny from my parents or anything like that. Once I graduated, that was it. I had to earn money, hence the supermarket job but it also drives you to sniff out work. The downside being, I don't own my own home. We live in a 2 bed flat, and one room is the studio. It's only now that I am able to actually save some money. For the first 5 years, I basically lived hand-to-mouth and one year, I left my tax bill until a few days before the deadline. It turned out bigger than I thought and I was essentially bankrupt for 3 months, fucking awful. Now I file my taxes in April, and have until Dec to pay them. Then I know what I have to aim for through the year.

I've probably forgotten quite a lot, but I will end with what I think has kept me employed for so long. EAR TRAINING. I basically stopped practicing my bass and replaced it for training my ear ever since. I don't need to play Victor Wooten songs to make a living. I need to hear anything and everything quickly. Students can learn any song they like, any catastrophe on stage can be handled, I can help bands with arrangement, harmonies quickly and easily. This is what people remember and will come back to you for. That and your work ethic and personality. 

Sorry for long story.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-01 01:08:50 65TwinReverbRI<br>You can't find anything, because this isn't a thing.

In traditional analog instruments, velocity and volume are inextricably intertwined (without the use of things like mutes, etc.).

Velocity really comes from the "throw" of a Piano Hammer.

It actually stems from Player Piano days and was continued to be used in Synth days.

It's really hard to measure how "hard" a hammer hits the string or how hard you press a key. And because of the way the piano action works, there's not a 1:1 relation between how "hard" you hit the key and how "hard" the hammer hits - I mean, it's more logarithmic than proportional across the range.

What this means is, to translate mechanical action into resultant volume, something else needs to be measure, and one thing you can measure is the speed - velocity - at which the hammer travels.

A higher speed will result in a louder sound.

When we moved to Synths, that don't have hammers, the sensors for this were moved to the keys themselves.

So they don't really measure how "hard" you hit a key, but how "fast" the key moves from its neutral position to its on position.

This is where you get "velocity sensitive" Keyboards.

Where synthesizers differ from acoustic instruments is that the velocity *doesn't have to* work like it does in real life.

And the changes in sound are based *in the patch* not on the keyboard (assuming it's a velocity sensitive keyboard).

So for example, many Guitar patches that emulate a Stratocaster will play a muted sound with a Velocity value below 64, will play a regular sound with a Velocity value of 64-99, and will play a "spanky" sound for Velocity values 100 and up (Velocity runs from 0-127).

In the real world, we don't pick any less hard or fast for muted notes, we're just deadening the string - so it's not about volume decrease here, but about the change in the sound - to what is essentially a different sound (in the old days these would have been different patches altogether, now they are different tones set to different velocity ranges).

Another use for this is you could set up a Patch for organ so that a higher velocity kicks the Leslie (rotating speaker) into Fast speed while playing at a lower velocity makes it low speed - *with no difference in volume*.

However, most Harpsichord patches work just like a real Harpsichord - no matter how hard you play on a real harpsichord, the sound is always the same volume because of the way the mechanism works (we could say that the mechanism always produces the same velocity out no matter what the velocity in).  So the synth patches do the same thing - they ignore the velocity value coming in, and just give you one velocity (volume) going out.

_________

So therefore trying to determine any predictable mood or sound is impossible as it is variable.

However, most acoustic instruments - which many synths do try to recreate accurately - as a general rule not only get louder with higher velocities but various other things like brighter, harsher, brassier, clangier, thwackier, etc. depending on the instrument.

Take a Piano for instance: The felt on the hammer is the same density, but because of the way it's shaped there is more material along the plane that strikes the string (perpendicular to the string).

When you play lightly, the hammer throws at a lower velocity. This compresses only the tip of the hammer's felt, meaning it "absorbs" more shock on impact and is thus like hitting the string with something soft - it makes a "softer" (not volume, but character) sound in addition to being quieter overall.

When you play strongly, the hammer throws at a higher velocity and that compresses the felt a lot more when it strikes, making it much more dense at impact - the felt is literally "harder" now. This is like striking the string with something more like bare wood - any percussionist who plays with various densities of yarn or wool (or felt as in bass drum mallets) mallets gets this - it's not only about how "soft" the material is, but how it compresses when it strikes (and also how dense the core of the mallet is, etc.).

So the resulting sound will not only be louder, but "sharper" or "brighter" or other such words.

But, with a closed system like a piano, where you can't choose the material the felt is made of, or how the action is designed (though it is somewhat adjustable) or what the strings are made of, and so on, it is just simply, lower velocity equals quieter and softer sound, while higher velocity equals louder and brighter sound.

This is generally true of most instruments - picking a guitar harder will make it louder AND brighter (assuming all else being equal).


But I should also note that there are ways to make instruments brighter or softer without necessarily agreeing with the velocity. Muting is already one example. Recording is another - we can record a piano that was played softly and turn it way up, and then turn down a piano that was played loudly so they are the same volume - this happens all the time in modern pop music that is compressed to the hilt - soft acoustic fingerpicking that is as loud or louder than a strongly picked part played through screaming amps - which might be way in the background.

This is kind of more where I would say what you're asking about is useful - whispering into a mic versus screaming into a mic will definitely change how we perceive what's going on in the music - the "mood" and "sound" if you will - but, if you put them the same volume in the recording, you've taken that part of it out of the equation (and this is somewhat like muting where even those sounds are not based on velocity only, but just as an example).

I see you added about the velocity of each note of a chord - this depends on if it's all on piano, or a 4 note chord on a string section etc.

But more volume will "bring out" the top note melody in a piano texture. We don't really think of this in terms of velocity - but in the MIDI environment that's the value that's assigned to it.

But going back to what I said above, if you play the top note "harder" it's not only going to be louder than the rest of the notes, but it will be brighter as well due to the faster throw of the hammer and more compressed felt on that one key, and thus will "stand out in the mix more".

But as far as just sitting there with a 4 note chord and changing the velocity on each note - that's not something we really concern ourselves with or play. There is orchestral music where it does stuff like that - it certainly changes the sound and the "color" of the chord.

Listen to this, it's all one chord for a real long time (with notes coming in and out, and changing instruments):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiyoLa9z1ao

But with a modern synth for example, we'd probably just pick a sound where this kind of stuff was built into the patch, rather than sit there trying to change the velocity of the notes (which you can't do on held notes anyway) or use aftertouch, etc. We might go into a DAW and change MIDI Velocity values for an effect, but that's a lot of work - not like spending endless hours trying to subtly adjust all your finger pressures on every single note within every single chord you play - we don't do that, we just let whatever happens happen.

Since every fret has essentially the same distance and is aligned perfectly guitarist has the benefit of being able to take a "shape" and move it anywhere on the fretboard to transpose the "shape" into any other key. 

We just made a virtual fretboard app. ([fretastic.com](https://fretastic.com)) it might help you explore the scales and chords a bit. 

As part of the dev process, I also made a tool in the app that let me play a midi piano and have the notes pop up on the fretboard. It's not public, but maybe we should make it public? Not sure if it would be helpful...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-19 12:11:16 65TwinReverbRI<br>Well, you get better at writing music by:

1. Learning to play more music.

2. Being trained to play music.

3. Being trained to write music.

4. Attempting to write music and failing at it, a lot.

5. Figuring out your mistakes and improving.

It sounds like you are trying to write for strings - are you a string player?

But you're also trying to use a "pop music" method of making music for a group that is traditionally not a pop music group.

If you want to "compose for strings" (with or without piano) and write music for string ensembles that is more typical and that is what you hear as "better", then you need to listen to, learn to play, and analyze that kind of music.

You'll find very quickly that most of that music is not 4 chord loops.

This is a common problem and it's because you're approaching music from the inside out rather than the outside in.

You need to think about form more, and "telling a story" with the music (and it will really help to get out of the whole "looping" mentality, which lends itself well to trance-like repetitiveness but not to formal excursions and explorations).

And listen to and analyze some music that does that.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-25 07:05:53 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;Is there a particular reason for that?

[flame suit on] because people who write pop music are uneducated [flame suit off]

Ok, really, that's not nice, but it is somewhat - somewhat - accurate - *comparatively speaking* that is.

Realistically, it was more part of the "rock" movement than anything, and one thing about "rock" is rebellion, and you can't do what your teacher told you to do.

So, "you have to raise the V in a minor key" turned into "fuck you I'll do the exact opposite of what you say" :-)

And a LOT of what goes on in pop music has to do with "anti-establishment" things - some of it was probably conscious - peopled didn't want their music to sound "too old-fashioned" or "too much like the establishment" and they also simply didn't know that stuff or weren't exposed to it.

A lot of people learned from folk music, which tended to be more modal, and people learned from blues as well. 

And they didn't go to school and study harmonic minor and melodic minor and classical music necessarily.

Pop people always get offended when I say these things like I'm some elitist classical guy being condescending but I'm a rock guy and work in both worlds - and with people in both worlds. What I need to know for a rock gig is different - and "simpler" in many ways - and I play prog rock where the music is typically "of higher caliber" than most general pop songs.

So outwardly, it mainly has to do with style. People back then wanted to use what they used, and people now want to use something else. Same as why they want to use guitar bass and drums rather than a string quartet.

It's really a taste thing.

Why tastes change is a different issue, but history is full of people just getting tired of the same old same old and enthused by something new, until that becomes the same old same old.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-26 02:08:40 65TwinReverbRI<br>I find it really hard to reach the keys in any kind of proper position when I'm composing *on* the piano :-)

Sorry. Had to do it. Quarantine silliness.

I too find it impossible to work on a computer. I can't even get it open if I'm sitting on top.

Ok, sorry. Bad jokes. Dad jokes. Sad jokes...

First, this is a music theory forum, not a composing forum.

There's r/composer for that.

Second, you've given us no information on your background other than it seems you might play piano (but how well) and you're in a music class (collge, high school, is this a theory class, a composition class, or just a band class?)

OK, to understand "how to compose" you need the following "ingredients" if you will:

1. Ability to play an instrument. Piano is a good one.

2. Have played tons of music on that instrument, preferably to the point where you play the instrument well, or better than average based on your peers.

3. Learned enough theory to understand Keys, Chords, and what notes are in chords and so on, well enough to **analyze** the music you're playing and what you're already noodling around with.

And then more specifically, to **compose**:

1. Pick a **model**. A piece you want to write a piece like. This should absolutely be a simple piece at first - not an orchestral piece, not a string quartet, not a sonata, or a symphony, or anything like that. A simple little piano piece.

2. How long did you practice your instrument to get good? You have to "practice" composing in the same way. You're not going to play every piece perfectly - sometimes even fairly simple ones - on the first try. You're not going to write a masterpiece on your first try. You need to understand that you have to start at the beginning and learn the basics, and what you start with is going to sound more like Three Blind Mice than it is a Piano Sonata or some modern new-age derived piano kinds of pieces.

3. Sketch. Doodle. Study. Do you know that artists do this? You don't just walk up to a block of marble and start hacking away with no plan. You don't just start typing words with no plan when you want to write a novel. You don't just throw paint on the canvas when you want to paint a portrait. So like when an artist wants to paint something, they do sketches first, then they do a miniature version (sometimes a couple), and they have models (or something to look at) and even make more than one version. Or think more like a Movie today - no one just turns on the camera and starts recording to make a movie (other than just home movies). First there's a story idea, that gets turned into a script, and then it has to be decided on how it's going to be shot, and then shot, and edited, and all that - that's why there's like "Director's Cut" and theatrical releases that are different and so on. So **it is OK to make more than one version** or make revisions, and so on. Do you know how many movies start to get made and then never get finished? And do you know how many movies get made and never get released? And how many movies have you watched that suck? Or are just so-so? How many by great directors are so-so - even the best can have a flop here and there. So:

4. Do not think everything you write has to be or is going to be perfect, a masterpiece, or even the best you can do at any given time. Instead, it's more like swinging at every pitch that's thrown at you in the hopes that you'll make a home run here and there. You may strike out, you may connect and hit a foul ball, you may connect and hit a pop fly and get caught out, and you may hit and not make it to first before you get tagged, and you may make it to first, or 2nd, or 3rd. Not every hit is going to be a home run, and there are going to be a lot of misses!!!! What you can't do is sit around never swinging waiting for that perfect pitch that's going to give you a home run - it'll never happen, and you'll never learn how to swing well enough to hit it that way. You have to be willing to fail as a composer.

5. But, trying to do this all without any help is only going to make it more difficult for you. You need a "coach" just like Baseball players do. You need to study, just like good artists and writers do. If you're not already taking piano lessons, you should be. If you're not already taking composition lessons and want to compose, you should be (but I realize this may just be a class assignment).

6. You should also have a "reference point" and that is existing music. This can be the "model" I was talking about above, but it can just be music you like that you want to write like. Learn it all, analyze it, see what it does, and copy that. Don't sit around "just doodling". Now, that's not to say that an artist or poet can't come up with a finished product just by doodling. And sometimes the doodle itself can be quite good. That's like "improvising". But I can guarantee they've doodled millions of times before and already know what works and what doesn't (this is how people who draw pencil comics can quickly re-draw their characters - they do it a LOT - practice) and they also have learned to hone and craft an inspired doodle into a finished work (which also takes a lot of practice).


Given you have only a few months, I would:

1. Make sure you understand and know how to meet any specific requirements - like particular chord types that are required - any Rubric you may have been given, etc.

2. Find some pieces of music that seem to fit the assignment's requirements - things you can play on piano pretty easily, and something you feel you could write like as well. Then use those pieces as models. Spend a week figuring out what they're comprised of - deconstruct them. (this is basically what mean-nectarine said as well).

3. Now, once you've deconstructed some of the pieces you've learned to play and chosen as models, try to make a SKETCH. or a STUDY. Or an "outline" even - a ROUGH DRAFT. Or 10 Rough Drafts. Don't worry about trying to make a "finished piece" on the first try. If you do, great. But mainly just get some ideas together - remember that crap they used to make you do in English class where you "brainstormed" and put an idea in the center and then wrote down other things related to it? Well what English teachers were trying to teach you to do with the brainstorming, then an outline, then a rough draft, is that's how people who know what they're doing actually work. I was one of those guys who skipped all that stuff and just wrote the paper because I didn't want to do all that work. Probably why I always got a C in English. But as I learned more about music composition, and the way other artists work, I realized that making music is very similar. It's not just write some notes down and keep adding until you get a finished piece. It just simply doesn't work that way (or rarely does it work that way).

4. I also agree with mean-nectarine that if you need a short term solution, take a pre-existing form and progression and use that as your model. There's no shame in it and it's done all the time. I had to learn "Sucker" by JonASS Brothers and it's a Cycle of 4ths progression. I'm not saying it's "great" (I think it is a sucker of a piece of music) but they're laughing all the way to the bank. Musicians do this all the time - composers do this all the time - they take existing ideas and "sculpt" them into something a little different, using other music as a model. People do this all the time - "I want to write like X" - they come here and say that, but the first thing you find out is, they don't play the instrument on X, or any instrument, they haven't learned to play X, and they haven't analyzed X. It's silly then to just think you're going to be able to sit down at a DAW and be able to make X.

Hope that helps.

Maybe if you share your composition or your drafts over on r/composer we can help you more.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-26 07:15:11 65TwinReverbRI<br>Power Chords are simply E-B - a 5th.

E4 and B4, or E3 and B3, etc.

Also, E3-B3-E**4** is a Power chord.

So is E3-B3-E4-B4 - and any other E or B notes you want to tack on above or below.

E2-E2-B3 is a Power chord too.

B3-E4 is not usually considered a Power Chord, though if we played B3-E4-B4 we'd probably call that an E5/B, and thus a power chord.

We don't usually play chords like E3 and B**4** and wouldn't typically call that a "power chord".

But all those power chords, and even those I mention above that we don't typically call Power Chords are also "Dyads".

A Dyad is a 2 note "chord" (or interval) even if there are duplicate notes.

So E-B is a Dyad that is also a Power chord.

E-G is a Dyad too, but we don't have any kind of name for it other than "Dyad" or "Interval".

We often call them simply "thirds" when it's E-G.

When the G is an octave higher (or the E and octave lower) we just call them "tenths" - that song "Scar Tissue" by The Red Hot Chili Peppers is a good example.

These are not generally used as chords by themselves, and orchestral music - except that inspired by rock - generally doesn't use power chords either.

Instead they tend to stack chords in "open position" which means there may be a 5th between the lowest two voices, and a 6th between the next two, so like

C4 - G4 - E**5**

String Instruments are tuned in 5ths, and playing 5ths on most of them except Cello is not the easiest or most idiomatic interval, so they're likely to play 6ths. But you can play 10ths against an open string two.

But many orchestral works also feature "divisi" which means half the celli play the lower note and the rest do the upper note.

So it's really hard to know exactly what you mean without seeing a score.

But simply put, any two note chord is a Dyad, and they're only named by the interval (such as Major Third, or generically as just a Third sometimes) and outside of Rock music where the "power chord" is ubiquitous, most people are even going to call the 5ths just Dyads or "fifths" (dyad is actually not all that common a word and most people don't know it and many spell it incorrectly as diad).

These dyads can **imply** a harmony, or they can be part of a larger chord. But they are not really "nameable" chords on their own (outside of the power chord in rock/pop).

When they're moved apart an octave, they can still imply the same harmony but we're also more likely to hear them just as two separate voices playing notes of some harmony, more acting as Melody and Bass.

So it depends on the context.

**Teach her how to connect with music**, at least with pop songs.

How to find out songs metrum. How to count in into song (obviously most pop music is dance music, so one phrase is 8 beats 99% of the time), so she knows where's the 1st beat. Make her realize that most music flows in "sentences"/phrases (8 beats), so it's a good way to find out the downbeat.

How to find out song's key by ear.

Teach her major scale on some instrument (on guitar, teach it linearly on one string) and (major/minor) chords connected to each degree:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOIscQAWL5M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOIscQAWL5M)

Then go to:  [https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/common-chord-progressions](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/common-chord-progressions)

Take 3 to 5 most popular chord progressions. Tell her the progression. Listen to one song from the list together. Then ask her to find out metrum, listen to phrases, find out downbeat. Then practice finding out key of the song (trial and error). On guitar she seek for the key on a B string, using C major scale from the first fret.

Then figure out chords of the progression.

Obviously start with I → V → IV → V:  [https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/common-chord-progressions/7](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/common-chord-progressions/7)

Then make her listen and copy rhythms from the song. She can either strum muted strings on guitar, or maybe you can drum on some box? :)

Then connect everything together (so she can strum rhythms that she copied with chords that she figured out) :)

At first do all of this together, while having fun, help her if she struggles. Then encourage her to find out metrums/keys/chords by herself. Give hints.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-04-11 03:21:39 65TwinReverbRI<br>It really depends on how you define them, and what time period or style you're talking about.

We use "Modality" to describe music from let's say roughly the Fall of Rome (476) up through the Renaissance (1500s into the 1600s).

We use that term to distinguish that music as a whole from the music that came after, which started exhibiting different enough characteristics to warrant a different name - Tonality, which begins in the 1600s and continues through the 1800s, and is still practiced in various forms today.

In that Modality, Modes were used. 8 of them (2 versions of each of 4 modes).

In Tonality, Major and Minor Keys were used. Only 2 of them. During that time, the Modes fell out of use (though could still be found in older pieces still being performed, or in folk music, etc.).

Today, most modality (that isn't surviving from the past or a direct homage to it) is treated as if it were Tonality in many ways. Tonality (that isn't surviving from the past or a direct homage to it, or a continuation of it) is also "not what it used to be" a lot of times.

And there's a lot of crossover and hybridization to the point where today there's maybe more of a spectrum with "truly modal" on one end and "truly tonal" on the other, with the vast majority of most music being in the center, but maybe overall leaning towards the tonality side.

People have grappled with what to call this music.

One broad term is "Centric Music" - not because it's in the center like I just mentioned but because there is a musical emphasis on a Central Note or Central Harmony.

Tonality actually has an emphasis on a Central Note or Central Harmony but it does this through rather specific means.

Centric Music on the other hand can still promote a single note or harmony as the Center, but it's through other, not traditionally Tonal means.

Someone asked later, but I've already responded to it, about Jimi Hendrix's "Hey Joe". It is "in E" because musically, E is promoted as the Center.

But it establishes E as the Center not by traditional Tonal Means - it doesn't use Functional Harmonic Progression, it freely mixes chords from Major and Minor to the point where calling it one or the other isn't really that informative, and so on. Basically, instead of all this stuff, he just beats you over the head with the E :-)

So you might think of Tonality as a specific type of Centrality, using "Centric Music" to mean any music where a Pitch Center or Harmonic Center is established by any number of means, and Tonality being a style where that is done using Functional Harmony and  common tropes unique to that style.

And it's Functional Harmony and those tropes that make Tonality distinct from earlier Modality, that did not use those things.

Modality is not even "centric" in the same sort of way - we call the "center" in early Modality the "Final" - though it's not always the primary note nor the ending note, nor necessarily the most important note.

And while Tonality more obviously does these things as "goals", what both (or all) of these things are really are Systems.

It's really differences in "coneptual" things we're talking about here.

____

Now, all this said, most people are not familiar with early Modality at all, and no one has really ever heard of "Centric Music".

So they just think Tonality is all there is. It's why you see posts here daily about "what key am I in" when the music may not be in a key at all. We are so conditioned into this whole "key-based system" that everyone just assumes everything is "in a key" and when they do a little searching and learn the cool-sounding "tonality" they just think everything is Tonality (and boy, when they learn the words "functional harmony", watch out...).

"Hey Joe" is, IMHO, not Tonal. Nor is is Modal. It's Centric.

I call what "Composite Modality" (totally my term).

As I said above, there are many different terms people have tried to use - Expanded Tonality, Extended Tonality, Neo-Tonality, I'm sure someone has used Post-Tonality or Post-Atonality, etc. I would be fine with "Psuedo Tonality" but when you start throwing around certain words you get people (who usually don't know all that much) who are very passionate about what they think Tonality just going apeshit over "what do you mean Hey Joe isn't Tonal, you can clearly hear it's in E".

Today, very little music is "strictly tonal" in the Common Practice Period sense (1600s through 1800s). Nothing is really "strictly modal" in the pre-CPP sense either.

They have now both influenced each other (modality was kind of "rediscovered" in the late 1800s and tonal composers started mixing it in with what they were doing, creating a kind of "psuedo-modal with tonal underpinnings" kind of music) to the point where there's so much crossover IMHO a new term is needed to describe this kind of music - which is why I use Composite Modality to describe it.

Which is basically a System that is still Centric where notes and harmonies from various modes and major and minor scales (keys) are freely intermixed.

_____

Jazz players have their own ways of conceptualizing a lot of things, and most of them tend to focus not on the System in use for creating the music, but something to do with Improvising. "Modal Jazz" is kind of this "Centric Composite Modality" - it uses Modes as you would a Key - which is not too different from the way a lot of other pop and even art music does it. But the whole concept of improvising by using X mode over Y chord is a completely different thing and not "modality" though a lot of people would probably say so and argue with you about.
_____

Really, Modality and Tonality are not only diffrerent Systems and conceptually different, they are als closely assocatiated with particular styles.

Gregorian Chants are Modal.

Renaissance Masses are Modal.

Bach used Modal Hymn Tunes and harmonized them in a Tonal style for Chorales, essentially "tonalizing" things that were modal to begin with. Because of this, some of Bach's Chorale settings are "not-quite Tonal" as they contain enough elements that are modal or clearly derived from modality and not "strictly tonal". It's kind of interesting to see that "transition".

A Haydn Symphony is Tonal.

A Beethoven Symphony is Tonal (Beethoven interestingly wrote a movement to a string quartet called "in the Lydian mode" but it's an extremely "tonalized" version of a mode to the point where it's not very modal at all).

Debussy's music is tricky - it's "Centric" a lot of times. It is sometimes "almost tonal", sometimes "barely tonal", sometimes "almost modal", and so on. His String Quartet opens in G Phrygian for example, but, he treats the Modes more like "scale resources" as you'd use them in a traditionally tonal piece, which means they don't work like older modal music.

So around that time period, we see a "re-discovery" of modes and sort of like how Bach "tonalized modes", Debussy and others "modalized keys".

That kind of continues to this day, though in pop music some of those modal influences came not from art music, but from folk music (like Appalachian and British Isle folk music, as well as other cultures outside of Western Europe).

What this all kind of boils down to is a concept that is, "I'm writing in the Key of A, but using X scale". They approach it as if it's a Key (or at least, a Center) and use say, Phrygian Dominant for their note choices, or Dorian for their note choices, and so on.

Something like Dick Dale's "Miserlou" uses an Arabic scale (so a "mode" of a sort) set "in a Key". But people don't usually refer to this a Modal piece or Modality, or say it's "in" Double Harmonic Major or something like that. It's really more "tonal" than it is anything else, but the Andalusian Cadence and Double Harmonic Major scale create new and interesting sounds from "exotic" sources if you will that keep it from being "Strictly Tonal".

Something like The Beatles' "Norwegian Wood" is in E Mixolydian, but again most people wouldn't refer to that as "Modality" (as most people think everything is just Tonal) and would say it's "in E Mixolydian" but they're conceptualizing it as "In the Key of E, using the Mixolydian Mode".

That kind of idea is a trope - it's used constantly in any film depicting the Orient, or Africa, or Dinosaurs, and so on.

It sounds a little like "early music" and thus "pre modern tonality" music, or "exotic" and so on.

Couple this with the right instrumentation, and put it behind the film, and people believe it.

Do you know what "suspension of disbelief" is?

It's when you watch a movie about cavemen. You know you couldn't film them but we "suspend our disbelief" and just enjoy the movie.

The same thing happens when you hear strings in a rock song from the 60s - a lot of times it's a Mellotron. But we hear a string-like sound and go, "oh, strings" and then get on with the piece.

So when you have a movie about Cavemen, and you put some music in it that sounds remotely "not like Beethoven would write" you go, "hey, Caveman music" and get on with watching the film. 

Have you ever seen one of those movies set in the 1800s that has a pop music soundtrack or something - it just seems so ridiculously out of place - it's like if all the characters in a caveman movie had on a watch.

So listeners (and viewers) are kind of willing to let themselves believe so they can enjoy the movie.

All you have to do is get into the ballpark and it's all good.

Most of this stuff is just major and minor scales. You can try non-western scales (as they tend to be associated with primitive cultures too, because of western values and prejudices against other cultures) but really it's more about re-using these age old tropes.

So I'd either write like these people write, or do what I was talking about before - sound effects, percussion, "bone" and "rock" sounds pretty much - maybe grunts.

If they are quick, like in licks and stuff, usually they are just "Non Chord Tones" and don't affect what the chord is.

If they last a long time and are treated more like a chord, we're more likely to comprehend them as such.

You can translate all this down to D-A-D - which is a root-5th-root power chord.

You're basically adding E or F on top.

The F on top makes it Dm.

The E on top we'd usually call a "sus2" chord though.

So your patterns are simply D5 - Dsus2 - Dm.

With the barre on the 5th fret it's G5 - Gm - Gsus2 (though since you indicate a pinch harmonic it really depends on how much of the 7th fret note comes out and how much of the harmonic comes out, and if that harmonic is the same pitch or a different one, which means it's impossible to name this without knowing what note the harmonic is producing and whether the 7th fret note is heard or not).

The 2nd fret one is the same - E5 - Esus2 - Em. The one open string makes it E7 (the implication would be Em7 based on the context).

What all this means is really, you're just kind of playing either a G5 or E5 chord and embellishing it with the 2nd and 3rd scale degrees, or you're playing a Gm and Em chord and embellishing it with the 2nd scale degree. So they're again not necessarily 3 separate chords.

There's no "term" for this other than playing music and doing something that's really common in pop music.
