When people say music theory they mean the study 17th through 19th century European harmony. This will give you a good foundation of western harmony which is used in a lot of popular music today. If you want to branch out on your ideas, take an early music class or read up on it(look at stuff before the baroque). Almost all pieces composed then were polyphonic (each part is its own melody) and modal because there weren't concepts of homophony (melody with accompaniment) and major/minor. Another good place for inspiration is 20th century/modern wind ensemble composition. Composers now are not really limited to keys, meters, tonality, or anything so there's some really cool stuff now. As far as arranging there are books out there, but they'll mostly talk about how to arrange for different skill levels, ensembles, reductions, etc. I'd just write and see what sounds good if i were you, plus theory will give you a good understanding of where parts should sit in an arrangement; Melody- high, harmony's and counter melody- mid  and the bass is the chord foundation(fairly typical arrangement)Here's some places to get started.

-[Theory](http://www.musictheory.net/)
-[Free online notation software](http://www.noteflight.com/) this has midi/ virtual instrument playback so you can hear what you wrote
-Free [scores](http://imslp.org/)- music in public domain. lots of classical   music. You can browse by scoring and look at small ensemble arrangements
-Check and see if you school/uni is subscribed to

"Change ft. Akon (and Others)" and maybe "I'm in Love (With A Stripper)" are the only ones I can remember in my head.

Edit: and the new single "5 O'Clock" has a few I think. "Can't Believe it (Justin Timberlake Remix)" has a really cool one at the beginning.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-06-30 05:59:20 xuol<br>There are three main sections to a fugue (at least, in the sense of a fugue in Bach's time, which is what I'm assuming most classical musicians assume of when they hear the word "fugue"). The first is called the "exposition," but the latter two are simply the "middle section" and "final section." As far as I know, this subdivision isn't a universal one in the music theory community, but that's because I really don't know that much about fugues.

In the exposition, you begin with the subject, which is a short phrase of melody. The first thing that usually happens in a fugue is one of the voices plays the subject unaccompanied. After the subject is played the first time, another voice plays it again from the start, but in a different key - this is called the "answer". While this is happening, the first voice that WAS playing the subject plays the "counter-subject" which is written to sound good with the answer. After the answer and counter-subject are done (they're at the same time, mind you, not one after the other) then there's an optional "codetta" before the subject gets played a third time by a new voice. The voice that was playing the answer now plays the counter-subject. The voice that started the piece off and has already both played the subject and the counter-subject is essentially free to do whatever the composer wants it to do, while the second voice plays the counter-subject and the third voice plays the subject. Likewise, each new voice takes up the subject and then the counter-subject. So essentially, each voice takes a turn entering and plays the subject, then the counter-subject, and then is allowed more freedom. When the last voice has played the subject, then the exposition is over. (The subject is always presented only in the tonic and dominant.)

The middle section has a number of devices that can occur in a number of different orders depending on the fugue. One is the "episode," which can consists of a combination of either 1) fragments of the subject and counter-subject put together in interesting ways that had not been presented to the audience earlier, and 2) new material. Another is the "middle entry," which just means the subject is introduced again (usually in a new key, to make it interesting). The last is "stretto," where the subject is played in one voice while another voice is still playing the subject. The middle section can use any sort of combination of these presentation of subject, and it's really up to the composer.

The final section often does utilize stretto as well. Also, a pedal can be used (often the dominant or tonic) to add more tension to the final resolution. Generally, though, the subject is introduced a number of times in stretto before finally being heard again in the tonic key (usually with the pedal point).

If you're feeling lost by the wall of text, consider the following visual aide: [Bach's "Little" Fugue in G minor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVadl4ocX0M).

The green line that plays by itself at the beginning is the "subject." Where the yellow line comes in, it starts playing the "answer" (which sounds very similar to the subject, but is in a different key) and the green line goes starts playing the "counter-subject". At 0:34, you're expecting the subject to come in again, because it's the end of the answer and time for a new voice to enter. But then, there's a brief codetta (it starts right at :34), and then the orange line comes in. You know what the orange line's playing. That's the subject. You've heard it twice. Likewise, the yellow (second) voice is now finally on the counter-subject. The green line, though, first drops out briefly and then returns, adding to some chords and then just sort of wandering around to where it needs to be. After that entrance, the red and purple lines enter with the subject. The yellow drops out (it'll be back) and the green continues doing whatever (check out that trill), while the orange now has the counter-subject. Hopefully it's obvious by this point - each voice enters with the subject, then plays the counter-subject when a new voice joins.

Of course, once the red and purple voices finish the subject, they immediately violate this rule. That's okay, though - we're now in the middle section, so the "rules" for the exposition don't apply any longer. There's a brief episode where Bach uses some nice little cycle 5 motion to make a peaceful, easy-to-listen-to transition. Then, you hear the orange line play the subject again - but it's not the entire subject, just a snippet. The red and purple voices seem like they're going to continue where the orange voice left off, but then they just hold one note for a long time. (This is a pedal, like usually in the final section. Pedals aren't specific things that only happen in the final section of fugues; they're often used in a variety of musics.) The higher lines seem like they're going to take over again when the red and purple drop out, but then they go in a different direction. Remember; this is an episode, which - as I said above - often consists of fragments of the melody of the subject. That's why a single voice isn't just playing the melody.

Then, the yellow and green voices take up the subject and counter-subject in a major key. Where the orange pedal point ends, you might recognize material that was from the codetta earlier. After this, the yellow picks up the counter-subject (like it would in the exposition, since it just played the subject) and the red and purple lines play the subject. Green, again, fills in what it needs to (but you might recognize that trill, I told you to check it out last time). Then, at 2:38, the green again has the subject, and the red and purple pick up the counter-subject (they did just play the subject). There's some more transition material, and then the subject comes in one final time. (Then there's a Picardy third. Damn it, I hate Picardy thirds...)

Anyway, that was long-winded, but hopefully it helped you get a general idea for how fugues work, and then showed how to apply it to an actual fugue. If you need/want any more info, please ask!

If I was going to be critical about anything, I'd say just playing the root notes in the string part all the way through is a waste, when you could be playing some sort of harmony or counter melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-07-08 15:22:03 spencerbateman<br>I think modern music has been a lot more focused on rhythm than tone, especially with all the new stuff being done on computers. Since it is so artificial it is often difficult to organically come up with a melody, and instead these artist take advantage of the "computer aspect" and creating impressive rhythms, especially drums, to counter act both the banal melodies and the regimented format which they must work against.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-08-04 14:22:40 Nyves<br>I'm going to assume that you're not trying to make a career out of composing but just trying to get through this class, so...

DISCLAIMER: I'm not a pro but these are tips.


Pro tip 1: You'll be on an emotional roller coaster through the whole thing. Just be aware of that. 

Pro tip 2: The music program that you use might not sound good when it's played back. Try actually playing the measure or phrase on a piano (if for piano or with multiple instruments) or the instrument that it's for. The Sibelius playback on my shitty sound card makes it difficult for me to imagine the actual sounds that will come from the instrument(s) because of the gross MIDI sounds.

Pro tip 3: There's no order to doing it. I (Oboist, Violist, Horn) tend to think of the melody/counter-melody/harmony before anything else. My dad (Pianist, guitarist) always has the chords first and maybe the melody. My friend (Bassist, Tuba, percussionist) thinks of a cool bass line and builds on it. You start the way you feel is best and the rest will come to you. 

Pro tip 4: see Pro tip 1
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-08-16 01:59:09 BKA93<br>I don't know if I have any music theory knowledge for you. But I have found arpeggios are always nice. You could also harmonize the cello and the violin together. So if you are arpeggiating a C major chord, have the Cello start on a C, and the violin start on an E, then play the arpeggio. I don't know if there is an actual name for this, but of someone can, please enlighten men. Just an idea for you. Otherwise maybe you could use the cello as a bass and play roots of chords, or roots and fifths, and the violin could be used for counter melody or a harmony part to the vocals. I like the counter melody idea better though. These are just some ideas. If you don't understand anything I said here just message me and I'll explain.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-08-28 02:01:18 gecko2222<br>Well, let's try a creative exercise..

The piano is a two-handed instrument.  You can play a chord with one hand and a melody with the other.  Depending on how many notes you want in your chord, you may need both.

Now, to make your arrangment more interesting, play it only with one hand, both parts, probably the left.  You'll need to figure out when you can play chords to fit with the melody without being able to play everything at once.  Once you've got that, now you have a free hand to play something else new.  Maybe it's a different part of the main chord, maybe it's a doubled melody, maybe it's a counter-melody..

Just a suggestion of course, but a good way to inspire creativity is to give yourself different constraints to work with and go from there.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-09-01 20:49:30 psychguy<br>Ambiguous tonality is a common element, and many tunes feature gapped scales. A pentatonic scale is a common gapped scale (missing two notes), but there are countless other variations and hexatonic scales (missing the 3rd, 6th or 7th) are equally common. A good example would be an ambiguous dorian or mixolydian tune that just eliminates the 3rd, such as [Hag at the Churn](http://www.thesession.org/tunes/display/829). There are no clues in the melody as to whether the tune has a major or minor feel until near the B part, and even then the 3rd is just used as a passing tone. Another example would be [Brian Boru's March](http://www.thesession.org/tunes/display/271), which could be either minor (very rare) or dorian, as it is missing the 6th.

Going along with that, harmonies generally do not serve a functional role. Avoiding strong resolutions such as ii-V-I, omitting the 3rds in chords, using counter-melodies rather than chords, using the tonic and dominant note as drones (in any voice; it does not have to be a low voice), and emphasizing a subdominant-dominant cycle (vii-I in modal tunes, IV-I in major tunes) are all common. The avoidance of strong resolutions and ambiguous tonality contribute to a meandering feel.

Many celtic melodies predate concerns about harmony, and cannot be functionally harmonized using typical western theory. For example, in 6/8 over a D drone, you commonly hear A-G-E D. If someone added chords, they might play progressions like C - D, C - Dm, D5 - D5, G - D, Csus7 - D, or A - D. The A-G-E run does not imply any particular chord, especially since V-I resolutions are typically avoided and playing the 4th note over a V chord can sound really bad.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-10-11 19:51:50 RoboStormo<br>Well listen to Bach fugues if you want counterpoint. 

Some modern music that got me into modern music with multiple melodies simultaneously and connecting on harmonies in a counterpoint-esque way


http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=L2LHdzLUPa8#t=196s guitar in right and left ear playing different melodies, piano in the center playing a third separate melody


http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=adjFhVeOvzs#t=25s guitars in separates ears with different melodies, occasionally meeting for parallel 3rds harmonies. separate melody by bass in the center


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH4HIn5Pfvg this is basically a vivaldi or bach rip at the beginning. 


The point with counterpoint is to listen for multiple melodies at the same time that combine in order to make something more. The melodies are supposed to have contrapuntal motion which means they should frequently move in the opposite direction. So if one melodies notes start to go higher, the counter melody has notes that are going lower. The examples above are not exactly like the master Bach or classical counterpoint, but they are easy ways to start trying to listen for multiple melodies at the same time instead of just 1 melody over backing chords.

edit: Also, just listen to Bach because he is the man and a source of endless interest  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-10-24 07:44:18 JimmyNic<br>Firstly are there are good books to read on contemporary music theory that explore what you've described?

&gt; Or what about a song in a minor key? Let's say I have a song in Am. It would be perfectly fine for me to use Em, instead of E, as the five chord. But without that leading tone, is the song really "in" Am. Couldn't I just say it's in C, and Am is vi? But what if G never resolves to C, instead F does. But Dm also resolves to Am in a iv-i motion. What key am I really in? There are cases in pop music where we can't determine if the song is really "in" either the relative major or minor, but by context it is usually obvious which chord the songwriter is treating as "home." Again, "functional harmony" breaks down. 

I happen to always analyse songs from the perspective of the Major key, mostly to maintain consistency. Then again I'm mostly using it as a tool to spot interesting chord changes, which brings me to a counter observation concerning the use of functional harmony. **Regardless of whether pop music uses leading tones most songs rigidly follow the diatonic framework in terms of chord choices and melodic content.** The chords most songs use are I, IV, V and vi, with occasional use of ii and iii. At their most audacious pop songs will use an III chord, which arguably doesn't even fall out of the remit of functional harmony (at least as I understand it), though it does flout the other habit of sticking rigidly to the Major and Natural Minor scales. 

From what your telling me pop music has somewhat reinvented the relationship between melody and harmony, but it does seem as though they have fallen into a newly carved homogeneous idiom. 

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-10-30 05:27:27 TheFreshestEnt<br>I see how you could maybe hear that section as being somewhat like an invention, there was definitely some imitation and trading of parts going on but there is quite a bit of structural logistics involved in truly writing an invention.(usually it is built off of a single motive or phrase and traded between parts from tonic to dominant while adding a counter-melody and doing the same with it to complete the "exposition" and going on to develop the motive(s) in an episode and finally ending with either a restatement or a coda) 


TLDR; No, and No
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-02-20 14:28:03 Salemosophy<br>Been a composer now for 15+ years and began like you with "stuff" going all over the place in my head, so here's where you might begin first. Forget perfect pitch. Few in the world actually have it, and a majority of them aren't composers anyway, so it's not a big deal. Developing relative pitch will help you immensely (by studying intervals, space between one pitch and another). 

The melodies and harmonies in your head are your first step... before the theory. Get in front of a piano or even a notation program and get those ideas down first. You can start from melody. You can begin with the bass line. You might even hear a counter melody or something in an inner voice. Just sketch all that out to the best of your ear's ability. Trial and error at first. Trust me, this was HUGE for me, and I think it will be for you as well.

Once you have a snippet of material that's out, on staff paper, then you can start putting theory to use. Theory is what helps you understand what you have written, teaching you ways in which you might analyze what it is you've written. Asking what you have written here at r/musictheory might be a good way to get some direction on where to look next, what concepts to hone in on, and so forth.

Start simple. Melody, bass line, and possibly one or two "lines" in between those (vertically) may be your first steps. It all depends on what's actually in your head. Maybe you should be layering melodic lines on top of each other or something. Just try to put whatever it is down and take as much time with it as you can to make it perfect (because it's great training for your ears). This process becomes much easier as you train your ears and study more theory, so stick to your guns now and finish whatever this is that you hear in your mind now. Don't wait for the theory to "tell" you what it is or else you might lose that idea or alter it forever (for better or worse).

Just my advice. Good luck!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-02-22 13:54:19 brutishbloodgod<br>&gt;I can barely make sense of most theory, and when I do it seems painfully obvious in retrospect.

Something to know about music theory: Western concert music and music theory have developed side-by-side for hundreds of years. That means that we constructed a theoretical framework around music that was much, much less complicated than what would be written in later centuries, and rather than starting over every time we discovered something new, we just kept adding to it. That means that a huge amount of music theory is *extremely* counter-intuitive. Very few learn music theory without sharing your frustrations. 

The best place to get started is with ear training. Ear training is great because it helps you move between the theoretical and the practical--you can name what you're hearing and apply theory to that. Here's a website that is great for that (and it's got a lot of other cool stuff also):

http://www.musictheory.net/

The idea is that you want to be able to identify a melodic interval (two notes played sequentially) just by hearing it, and then you can move on to harmonic intervals (two notes played at the same time) and chords.

Other than that, you'll want a solid foundation in the basics--notation, time signatures, major and minor scales, intervals, and major/minor/7th chords (and probably some other stuff too). Then I think it would be best to look at functional harmony, smooth voice leading, and melody writing. If you have questions about what any of those terms mean, how/where you can learn about them, how to put them into practice, etc, let me know or just make a new post in the subreddit.

Also if you have any specific musicians that you want to emulate, you can post a link to a song on youtube or where ever and ask about what they're doing theory-wise. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-03-07 01:38:52 Shredder13<br>Well, Bach and Mozart pretty much gave us the modern rules of music that are rarely broken. If you write a melody, that's probably something Bach and Mozart perfected. Harmony? Bach and Mozart. I guarantee you EDM doesn't do anything outside the realm of music theory, because theory already covers everything (unless you're using semitones). If you modulate to another key, yeah EDM does that pretty jarringly sometimes. But the best EDM (in my opinion) follows theory very closely, causing it to sound more mature (aka not written by a child).

Having said all this, a lot of EDM uses counter-melody. You might want to familiarize yourself with that. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-03-23 10:47:37 Salemosophy<br>So, you're asking what a chord symbol with altered 5ths and 9ths might look like?

Say we have a Cmin7 b9 b5, that's how it would be written. This would actually be a Cdim7 b9, meaning "diminished" (which means the 5th is lowered already), so the b5 would be redundant with that label. 

I'm not quite clear on what you're asking. If this doesn't help, can you provide an example?

EDIT: I think I understand your question. Usually, when the chord is major, the 5th is raised. When the chord is minor, the 5th is typically lowered (sometimes happens in v-i progressions, because the 5th degree of v is the 2nd scale degree of the key, which then becomes lowered sometimes through voice leading to evoke the Phrygian mode). You usually have a minor sonority with b9 and a standard 9 with a major sonority. 

The melody usually has the altered pitch, and altered 7th chords are typically the result of chromatic voice leading, often in a prominent voice like the soprano or the bass. It can sometimes occur with inner voices to draw instruments out, like the French Horn might have a counter-melody that alters the 5th of a sonority to draw attention to the voice.

We play blues rock, funk and have started experimenting with psychedelic sounding music and and whatnot.  What i have found is that when i am not soloing the best sounding things for me to play are shot notes or to play a counter melody to what our singer is singing.  Listening to our recordings the sax is like adding another layer of texture to the sound of the band.  In my opinion my sax is the icing on the cake that is my band. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-04-06 08:16:54 [deleted]<br>Start with the closest diatonic modulations: i.e. the keys 5 semitones up or 5 semitones down from your home key (equivalently: 7 semitones down or 7 semitones up). Of course these two modulations are most often referred to as going around the circle of fifths (or fourths, same thing) clockwise or counter clockwise. Clockwise and counter clockwise circle of fifths modulations are reflections of each other, so they are pretty much the same, only opposite in direction, i.e. one moves the tonic down 5 semitones by sharping one of the tritone pitches a semitones, and the other moves the tonic up 5 semitones by flatting the other tritone pitch a semitone.  

So play a phrase, melody, theme, whatever. Then transpose it around the circle of fifths, Play it perfectly transposed. Continually go around the circle in one direction, i.e. raise the tonic by 5 semitones, then another 5, then another 5, etc. Go the other way, lower the tonic by 5 semitones, then 5 more, then 5 more, etc. Then try doing 2 movements around the circle at once. Move the tonic up 10 semitones, then another 10, etc. Go the other way too. Etc. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-04-15 03:33:19 [deleted]<br>Circular conducting ftw! Haha, j/k. We made fun of the conducting student once when she conducted 5/8 using a circle motion.

When composing, I like splitting complex meter up into more digestible parts. Say a piece starts in 7/4, I'll write it as 3/4 &amp; 4/4 (or 4/4 | 3/4 depending on the phrasing). I like to make the decision in terms of what is easiest to sight-read. So, your #5 is my top choice.

That being said, sometimes it doesn't make sense to break up a more complex meter into simpler parts. It depends on what the melody/counter-melody/etc are doing. If the phrasing makes more sense as 7/4, then that's how I'll keep it. So, you're #7 is my second choice.

I have some examples of some of my pieces in odd-meter but I'm hesitant to share them publicly because my real name is associated to them. PM me if you're interested. If you want to look at the sheet music, then I'll need time to pull them off of an old machine that still needs to get set up... I should do that anyway. :-/

Edit: sight not site, damnit.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-04-18 05:40:57 Salemosophy<br>The order of the chords typically follows classification (Tonic, then Sub-Dominant, and then Dominant, returning to Tonic). Classifications aren't concrete, so there are some sonorities that might overlap depending on context:

Tonic sonorities:

* Tonic - I or i (obviously)
* Submediant - vi, VI, or bVI
* Mediant - iii or III

Subdominant sonorities:

* Subdominant - IV or iv (obviously), and rarely #vi^o (not entirely sure of classification because it's modal, but I'll stick it here for now)
* Super-tonic - ii, II, or bII
* Submediant - vi, VI, or bVI

Dominant chords

* Dominant - V or V7
* Leading tone - vii^o , vii^o 7, vii^~~o~~ , or vii^~~o~~ 7

So, take your pick of chords and substitutes to formulate your progression. The more challenging stuff might be learning and experimenting with different voice-leading procedures. I've come up with my own "system" of sorts when writing progressions to keep the process simple:

* Fifths - move voices in contrary motion... easiest is to or from an octave between bass and tenor voices (so fifth, octave, fifth, octave, etc.)
* Use chord extensions or the third in the melody where possible to minimize any parallel movement between soprano and bass
* Contrary motion (voices moving in opposite directions) solves so many problems right off the bat, usually. Also, if your soprano and alto/tenor voices move by step, try looking for your bass to move by skips and leaps, and vice verse.
* Study orchestration if you're looking at writing for larger ensembles. In big ensemble stuff, bass voices typically double at the octave, then various instrument families will handle melody/harmony (and counter-melody). 

Also, I'll just recommend a motif approach to melody writing. It's saved me so much time actually coming up with material to have that simple, small gesture I can always refer back to, alter, transpose, or what-have-you and subsequently fool around with as you're writing. I dunno, my process may be atypical, but what's "typical" these days anyway, amIright? 

I don't have any text book recommendations except Ottman's notes online were handy (some PDF document you can download somewhere). Also, look wherever you can for scores/sheet music for the stuff you like and start listening with the score in front of you. Now that you have a comfortable grip on melodies and harmony, your best resource will be your ability to apply those analytical concepts (and I want to stress... "loosely") to what you're interested in learning more about. 

I think now's the time to start studying that stuff and being resourceful. My advice on textbooks is simple: Buy it when you know for sure that you need it, otherwise it might just end up collecting dust on your bookshelf. You'll know what you need once you start studying your music style and start learning about the terms specific to that style (like in Popular Songs, the "Hook" or something... that's specific to popular songs and not all of music). Also, Sondheim is a pretty huge name in songwriting simply due to his methodology in writing, so if you know what you're looking for, you'll know what to specifically ask for in terms of recommendations. 

tl;dr - See above about order of chords and such. As for textbooks, hang back and start studying some of your style of music with sheetmusic/scores in front of you. When you know specifically what you're looking for (progressions often differ from style to style), we're here to help!

Good luck!

I have done a lot of trial by error stuff in the past, And have run into a lot of the same problems you're having. 

I'm not saying it's wrong by any means, but the best songwriters (Thom Yorke, Bob Dylan, Surfjan Stevens, Townes Van Zandt) never start with their lyrics first. They always pick out a melody or tune and write to that. I have heard a lot of successful songwriters say that they never write a song without a guitar or a piano.

The greatest and most helpful thing I have found out about songwriting, is that the tune, and flow of a song is just as important as writing meaningful lyrics. 

One example of this is Alt-J's Breezeblocks. The lyrics make next to no sense, but Joe Newman, the singer/ writer of the song, is doted as a great songwriter. Why? Because his lyrics flow so well. 

One counter example is Bob Dylan's earlier work, which focused more on lyrics rather than a catchy melody. 

Hope I helped. By the way, there are subreddits that can actually help you with these kinds of things. /r/wearethemusicmakers and /r/songwriters are always eager to help.

1. brd91 covered this

2.  Well, the tritone thing has a sacred (aka religious) background.  The tritone was considered to be the "devil's interval" and was, therefore, avoided.  With regards to big jumps: Much early "Classical" music was sung (think Gregorian chants) and it's difficult to make big musical jumps as a vocalist.  I believe it's also tricky to do this on wind instruments.

3. The Cantus Firmus ("Fixed Song") is the primary melody that is being ornamented by the counterpoint.  This also has a sacred background.  In the early days of counterpoint, composers would create new works of art my taking traditional Gregorian chants (which were either sung by one voice or many voices in unison (known as a "monophonic" texture)) and adding secondary, "counter" lines.  With regards to the second part of your question: think about a Barbershop Quartet: you have the the "lead" guy singing the melody with the other three guys harmonizing.  It's generally pretty easy to tell who the "lead" guy is, right?  (Granted, Barbershop Quartets are generally more homophonic than polyphonic but you get the idea)

4.a. "where do the other notes come from"?  The same key that the Cantus Firmus comes from.

4.b. "do they matter in the rest of the melody"  Absolutely; all of the voices work together symbiotically and, at the same time, are all full-developed melody lines in their own right.  The basic idea is that on the strong beats the melody lines should all be forming consonant intervals.  Dissonant intervals are used for off beats and fifths/octaves/unisons are reserved for the beginnings and ends of phrases because the hamper forward motion.  A "passing tone" is a dissonant tone that is used to step between consonant tones.  These happen on off beats and often occur while one or more of the other voices are sustaining a note.

4.c. "could I just arpeggiate on those notes"  An arpeggiated chord isn't really a melody so, no, you wouldn't really do that if you were trying to write strict counterpoint.

Just a reminder that, while I *do* think it's important for a composer to master traditional counterpoint, you should never feel like you have to follow any music theory rules.  They were all broken hundreds of years before you were born, at this point.  Ultimately you just write what sounds good to you.

**TL;DR: Study J.S. Bach scores.**

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-09-25 07:03:09 BRNZ42<br>In every style of music, the bass does something different, but as a bass player, I can think of 3 main things that bass instruments do that transcend genre.

1. **Provide harmonic support.** The bass instrument is the foundation for the harmony. In the simplest example, basses play the roots of the chords, but that's not all a bass *does.* The bass is rarely static. Frequently the bass plays the root early on in the measure, and then colors the rest of the measure with other chord tones. Bass players play fifths and thirds, to help define the triad. Bass lines frequently have some direction pointing to the next chord. By leading the listener to a new destination, bass lines help drive the chord progression forward. 

2. **Provide rhythmic support.** Basses are rarely static. The rhythm of the bass line defines, or helps to define, the groove of the piece. Think of the driving walking bass lines that make swing swing; or the syncopated 1/16 note lines that make funk funky; or a Latin bassist who never plays 1, but always anticipates the next measure, giving that groove its unique flair. By defining the chords AND the rhythmic groove all at once, the bass line is the foundation that a song can be built upon. Bassists often talk about "groove" or "feel" and this is what we mean.

3. **Provide a counter line to the melody.** This is a little more abstract, but let's look at it this way: In typical contemporary music, we can break down a tune to 4 elements/voices. Drums, Bass line, Chords, Melody. Drums are chords are multi-note vertical pieces of the puzzle. Melody and Bass line are single-note horizontal pieces of the puzzle. Everything is balanced. And in this system, there are really only two pieces to the puzzle that you can swing or hum. The melody is the most important and most prominent piece, and the bass line contrasts it and supports it. Because it is a single-note line, the bass line acts like a standalone melody. And what it plays might not sound good as a melody, but it should sound great when given context by the real melody. If you were to take a piece of contemporary music, and just listen to the melody and the bass line, it should tell you all you need to know about the piece. The bass line and the melody together should make the groove, the tempo, and the chord progression clear. 

Of those three functions, you will probably find many exceptions to #3, but I think it still holds up. Think about a jazz song, where you have a melody and a walking bass line. The walking line, by playing constant 1/4 notes is defining the groove, and the notes the bassist chooses define the chords, and provide direction to the next chord. This is all the support the melody needs. And the interesting chromaticisms in a good walking line provide interest as a counter point to the melody. 

\#1 and #2 are pretty universal. If a style of music has a bass instrument or bass voice in it, I'd be pretty certain that it is performing these functions. Maybe metal music where the bass does nothing more interesting that doubling the guitar, or choral music in which the lowest singing voice never strays too far from the other voices. But I'd argue that the bass is still doing those things. In these cases, staying very close to the other voices so as to blend in with them IS the groove and texture that the bass is defining. If a style of music is characterized by not having an independent bass line, then the bassist is accomplishing #2 by not straying rhythmically, and accomplishes #1 by performing notes in the chord, probably lots of roots and 3rds. 

I'd be happy to answer questions. As my flair might suggest, I'm very qualified in this department, 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-10-17 22:40:58 klaviersonic<br>Counterpoint is an element of music, it's fundamental to harmonic and melodic movement regardless of genre. It isn't based on "rules" any more than melody writing is, though it is often taught from a strict discipline of "species counterpoint," a form of educational music that has never existed in actual musical practice. 

Counterpoint is very simply the interaction between multiple musical lines, rhythms, and textures.

Now, fugal imitation and canon, which are commonly associated with counterpoint per se, are relatively rare in pop. However, common "round" songs like "Row, row your boat" are actually infinite canons!

An excellent book on the subject is Ernst Toch's The Shaping Forces in Music. There's a wonderful look at a Bach Invention (No. 9 in F major) where Bach creates counterpoint against the prevailing contrapuntal texture by using parallel lines which dissolve the actual counterpoint, before returning to it, a kind of counter-counterpoint!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-11-07 14:38:45 -fd-<br>I've only come across this in the last few years so I'm not the best person to explain it, but here goes. I also don't know your musical background at all so I'm trying to pitch this at an inoffensively general level of knowledge. Sorry if I've under or over assumed anything.

In western musical traditions (what most of us grew up with) we often think of music as containing a melody and chords. Those chords might be voiced as a bass line, filler voices, harmonies or maybe a counter melody that emphasises the harmonic lines. Harmonic lines and chords are sort of the lens we use when analysing and creating music. This works really well for music using a major or minor tonality and we have a wealth of diatonic chord knowledge to apply to this. In fact, when we hear music we often 'hear' chords that go along with it, even if they're not fully voiced.

If you saw a C and a E in a two part melody with no key signature, you might assume that the implied chord is a C chord, and just 'hear' the G at the top. (yes, it could also be a bunch of other things but humour me.)

Other traditions don't necessarily view musical creation or analysis like this. Folk music, which often uses modes, wasn't always created with a chord structure in mind. It could use a melody, a counter melody using the same mode, a drone and some untuned percussion parts. We 'imagine' a chord structure onto that because we're so used to hearing it and when we hear two notes, we feel like there is a chord happening.

I find this easier to visualise with pentatonic scales because they are definitively missing notes we'd use to make a full chord palate:

C D E   G A (C pentatonic)

you could make a C chord (C E G) or an A minor chord (A C E) but that's about it. However, there is such a rich tradition of pentatonic folk music from a huge amount of cultures. Try mucking around with a pentatonic scale in two voices/hands- just the black keys on a piano would work if you like-  and listen to how it doesn't clash, even though you're not thinking in chords. A modern example (sort of) might be a band like battles, who explore riffs, rhythms and sequences to create a 'harmonic' patch work but it isn't really centred around a chord progression.

This is why some musical traditions like Kodaly don't label folk songs as being in 'G major' but rather 'G pentachord' or 'C hexachord' which tells you what the notes are but doesn't imply a harmonic underpinning.

Personally, I still think in chords. When I hear hot cross buns, I still hear I V I chords in my head. But I have been chastised for thinking like this and it can be liberating to look at music and composition without these influences.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-11-30 17:57:35 sirtaj<br>When talking about harmony in this context, what is meant is the lack of counterpoint, or counter-melodies accompanying the main melodic line in the music. Western orchestral/classical music uses this very strongly, especially (from what I know) from the medieval period onwards.

The tanpura is supposed to play the root "chord" of the piece, so it does actually use multiple notes, normally the tonic, the tonic an octave up, and some additional notes (most commonly the 5th, but this varies depending on the scale and raga). In the strictest definition you could possibly say that this is a "melody", but it's not treated as such - it's a drone, enveloping the performer in the scale and providing a hard reference from which they play/sing. The melodic line is supposed to come entirely from the one performer (or one at a time, if there are more than one "main" performers on stage).

An analogy would be a standard western rock band - the singer and lead guitarist always play one at a time, never together. The rhythm guitarist strums one solid triad/chord over and over, and the bass player just plays the root.

In more recent popular and folk music, harmonies of the western style are far more prevalent, but in classical music this hasn't changed and IMHO doesn't need to.

Think of the tune "Baby it's Cold Outside".  The song is pretty much melodic call and response.  The response could be considered a counterpoint.  It's basically there to add variety within an arrangement and keep the listener engaged.  Part-writing is pretty much just arranging.  The techniques available to an arranger are almost infinite and must be developed over time.  

Edit: this is a very simplified definition, BTW.  But it should give you an idea of what those terms mean.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-12-11 14:30:39 Salemosophy<br>Theory vs Composition in a Nutshell... from the perspective of cooking a meal:

The theorist is a cook who looks at a recipe and studies why the various ingredients work together. The composer is a cook who knows that some ingredients worked together in so and so recipe, so they combine those ingredients in a new dish with no recipe. Composers may not necessarily concern themselves with why different ingredients work together. They're more concerned with how to use those combinations in new or, perhaps, more interesting ways. It could be said that the theorist finds joy in developing a deeper understanding of a recipe, because through it, they might feel a deeper connection to the combination of ingredients that create that meal. Along those same lines, the composer finds joy in finding new ways to take the ingredients that already work together and create a new, satisfying experience from them. 

Both theorists and composers can find joy in the same work of music, but sometimes for different reasons. For theorists, that joy comes from discovering the deeper intricacies of harmony working with melody and rhythm, or maybe how continuity emerges between smaller sections of a work in relation to the larger structure (The Golden Mean in *Bach's Prelude in C for WTC*, for example). For composers, that joy comes from finding ways to combine those elements in ways that express their own ideas. As a composer, I often experience the "goosebumps" when I take that small germ of an idea I've heard in another piece and incorporate it in a way that satisfies my own aesthetic. Honestly, I'm a bit of a snob in some ways, because I'll hear a piece and think, "Man, that sounds really great, but I'd do it this way..." Then my brain toys around with it until something earth-shattering emerges in my mind. That's when I go to work, manifesting my own interpretation of that idea. Too often, it's something I've heard under the surface of a piece, like a random series of voice-leading choices or a counter melody that I think should be the most prominent idea of a piece. 

Eventually as we learn more about music (both what's around us as well as our own preference for aesthetic), our knowledge of theory and composition reach a point where they become one in the same. Someone who understands enough about theory to analyze anything they hear while simultaneously considering strategies for replicating what they like in their own voice are pretty much acting both as theorist and composer all at once. There's no reason to think the two are mutually exclusive of each other. But as we're in the early stages of learning theory or composition, it does tend to feel like the two are not the same. When you're so comfortable with what you're doing as a composer that you are essentially "creating" your own methods of analysis to understand your writing, you're thinking like a theorist. And when you're so comfortable with your understanding of musical elements that you're identifying patterns of choices a particular composer makes (or how those patterns change over the composer's life - i.e. Schoenberg), you're definitely thinking like a composer, or at the very least forming an appreciation of the way a composer's voice developed over time.

So ultimately, the theorist develops as much of a capacity to think like a composer as a composer develops the capacity to think like a theorist. There isn't really a line to draw in the sand here, except in the gap that tends to exist early on as we become introduced to the study of theory and the practice of composition. That gap takes a while to really close, too. Some don't really think about it. They focus their attention in one direction or the other. To each their own, I guess. That's just the way it has developed for me over the years.

It drives my SO bonkers when I do it, but 1) it's more fun than singing the melody and 2) you get a really good feel for the harmonic progression of the song if you're not melody focused.

Anything more complicated than a 3rd, 4th, or 5th are generally resolved by the end of the phrase in one direction or another (at least in most rock/pop music, the choral genre is it's own beast when it comes to vocal harmonies). Instead of seeing them as complicated chords, looking at each harmonic line as it's own counter-melody works better for me, that create prolonged suspensions if it's not in perfect harmony with the melody in the first place.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-01-15 10:47:57 Salemosophy<br>Berg and Schoenberg did things somewhat different from each other, at least in the music I remember analyzing. 

Berg was interesting in using 12-tone rows to create melodic material, which he then harmonized with tertian chords (created in thirds, like the chords we use in tonal harmony). The difference, I think, between tonal harmony and Berg's style was that the rows would situationally dictate the harmony (rather than using diatonic function to decide what chord follows from previous chords). 

Schoenberg, on the other hand, seemed much more interested in harmony as an aspect of motive. In other words, a motif wasn't just a melodic fragment. It needed context, depth, or character of some sort to be truly significant. So, when you listen to Schoenberg, the cohesive quality of his works is often characterized (at least in my opinion) by the way he constructs and deconstructs (develops) his rather complex motivic ideas. 

Schoenberg's methodology is something I really like to do in my music, actually. The only difference is that I'll take complimentary aspects of an idea and develop those into a secondary main idea. So, if I have a melodic line with a counter-melodic idea (a secondary line against the melody), I'll take that secondary line and develop the snot out of it. This leads to some really interesting, deceptive qualities in the stuff I do, which I enjoy hearing when I listen. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-02-02 05:12:18 Salemosophy<br>Sure, you'll get no argument from me on the value of understanding function. My comment is mainly applicable to process-based instruction. Like you, I'm also trying to consider what the average viewer of your videos needs in order to apply what you're teaching them. If the process you're teaching is to create a chord progression first and then compose a melody that works within it, then I'd counter that this is the kind of process that works more for figured bass than the process I'm proposing - because you already need a thorough understanding of function to construct a reliable chord progression from which a melody can then emerge. 

Consider a beginning songwriter asking the question you're proposing, "I've memorized the scales and modes, what next?" The next part that logically follows in this process (from what they already know) is to construct a melody from the pitches of the scale they choose and tweak that first. I've found the more effective ways to write music tend to be linear, so starting with a vertical process (chord progressions) puts the cart before the horse. That vertical process can be achieved more intuitively after melody exists. From melody, we get bass line. From melody and bass line, we get implied chords, and from that, we can then analyze for function and tweak as needed. 

It's not a criticism as much as a suggestion. "Why These Notes" is your baby, and I know there's a risk here of overstepping. I hope you won't take it that way. I think everyone ultimately benefits from collaboration, and that's the way I'm approaching it in my comments. I'm also thinking from my own personal teaching experience and how I've learned to 'scaffold' concepts for instructional purposes. I don't know if you feel it would be possible to follow up on your video with some process-oriented videos (maybe in two or three parts) that would take what you've introduced with function and apply it at the end. Maybe a two-part video on writing your first song that goes step-by-step through a process of writing a melody, adding bass, fleshing out the inner voices, and then analyzing for function. 

That's my advice for what it's worth. Once again, another well-done video with great potential for follow-up videos. You're sitting pretty so far. Looking forward to seeing what you do next. Cheers!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-02-12 04:35:27 shafafa<br>I like to write lots of types of music so this is kind of a general approach to more popular (jazz, funk, rock) genres.  This is, for the most part, the process I'll go through if I don't really have much inspiration other than music itself.

First I sit down behind the piano.  Usually if I'm trying to write a tune I start with a simple chord progression.  Once I have a rough sketch of a road map I start to think about melody.  What I like to do is pick out some nice extensions that add some extra spice to the chord and I put those on top in the melody.  Sometimes I just want something vanilla sounding to contrast everything else so I'll occasionally add chord tones to the melody, especially to release tension and other dramatic effect.  Slowly a skeleton of a melody starts to form.  I'll generally fill in the gaps with various leading tones focusing on each chord at a time until I'm satisfied with the way the phrase flows.  

If I'm writing lyrics I generally just start singing the melody with wordless vocals until something comes to me, usually I'll sing something that sounds close to a word and I'll start trying to build off from that word.  I'll add or take away from the melody depending on the actual lyrics I settle on.

After I have a melody down I usually start to try to come up with a bass line to compliment it.  I try to throw in the root mainly and sprinkle in other chord tones to create some sort of ostinato.  When I'm feeling good with the bass line I like to track drums then bass to a click.  Once I have that down I play around with comping chords on piano or a synthesizer, really whatever I decide to use as a chordal instrument, until I'm starting to like the overall feel of the song.  From that point I'll record the melody.  At this point I generally have a good structure worked out and If I want to add counter melodies, horn stabs, strings, or whatever else I'll add it now making sure it stays out of the way of and supports the melody.

The main thing for me is that nothing is set in stone at any point in the process.  If I hear something when I'm working on another part then I'll add that in, if I think something needs to go then I cut it (this is much harder for me to do than adding though).  

And I do have those rare moments of inspiration where you get a great melodic line stuck in your head and you can get it down on paper or on a simple voice recorder and work to add harmony after.  Or in the even rarer moments when everything just flows and I have a good amount of the song composed in my head all at once I'll typically sing each part into a voice recorder, then go back and construct everything.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-02-15 03:00:38 BRNZ42<br>Walking bass lines are mostly associated with swing and jazz music. They are characterized by constant quarter notes, with some embellishments here or there. Bassists typically improvise these lines by looking at the chord progression of tune. Using arrpeggios, scales/modes, and other tricks, a good bass player can imply the harmony of the music with the line. 

The role of a walking bass line is three-fold: 1) The constant quarter note drives the rhythmic motion forward, and works with the rest of the rhythm section to create that characteristic swing feel. 2) The notes chosen support the harmony, while giving motion towards the next chord. 3) Provide and interesting line that contrasts the melody and provided a bit of a counter point.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-02-22 06:31:20 Salemosophy<br>I write for band and can give you some ideas behind the style of marching band writing for horn sections.

Most of the chords you hear in marching band are simple triads combined with melodic extensions. So, your low brass might play the root and fifth, the melody might be 3rds and 7ths, and counter-melodies (like what Horns play a LOT in marching band) might just extend chords up to 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths. A pretty typical, idiomatic resolution is the #11 suspension voiced in the Horns and Saxes. It either resolves up to the fifth of the chord, resolves down to the Major 3rd, or it stays suspended on the #11. This #11 extension is considered a "Lydian" tendency tone (from the mode "Lydian" that uses a #4). 

Such chords are voiced with huge interval spaces. Imagine at the bottom of the ensemble are your Tubas, Trombones, Baritones, and Tenor Sax playing octaves or fifths. Then you have your Trumpets and Flutes playing the third or seventh (or really any pitch of the key) in the upper register. In the middle are your Horns, Clarinets, and Saxes. Spaced evenly, the Clarinets can cover the fifth and octave root positions to support the Low brass while your Horns and Saxes belt out that #11. 

Really, that's where you ought to focus your score analysis - on the extensions that occur outside the expected diatonic pitches of any chord. So, suppose you analyze the chords and find an FMaj chord with a BNat (for Horns, it would be written as an F# but sound as a B), refer back to the F Major scale and think, "That BNat isn't diatonic to F Major... that's a #4!" Boom! Your epiphanies will abound. 

Another thing to know is that the range of the Horn lends well to playing those extended pitches. As the Horn climbs its range above written C (F Concert) in the middle of the staff, the color is much more dominating. A Horn section can outplay a full marching band in its range from C in the staff to G and A above it. So, that's something else to consider.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-03-01 00:26:01 Octo_Z_McD<br>Like somebody else already said, that first link is less fusion and more electronica. cool tune though. 

Fusion (as it started out with Miles Davis, then Mahavishnu Orchestra and early Weather Report, etc) uses much simpler chord progressions, and is much "riffier" than jazz. Tunes like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDwPc_Bm22E are basically two (weird) chords. You have a few main riffs, which run counter to eachother at the same time. That's a classic Mahavishnu thing, coming from Indian influence. Like in jazz, the melody is stated, then everybody takes solos, there are some interludes in between, and then you hear the melody again toward the end. But the soloing style is HEAVILY influenced by rock music - pentatonics, bending notes, heavy distortion, etc. 

In my opinion, the most important aspect of fusion by far is communication. There is a metric fuckton of subtle communication going on in fusion bands. These are some of the tightest groups of musicians ever to walk the earth. Check out the Weather Report album "I Sing The Body Electric," and literally any Miles Davis album from 1966-1975. The ability to make and respond to musical "gestures" is one of the hallmarks of players in this style (probably because a lot of them also played/were interested in free jazz shortly before fusion became a thing). It's the kind of thing that most people don't pick up on when first listening to a record, but over time you notice it more and more.

Side note: Watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OLqid9RABs sometime. It's a debate between a reactionary jazz critic (these people are also referred to as "clowns" and "worthless tools") and a  percussionist who played with Miles during the fusion period.

Things are going to suck at first, you will use cliched ideas even if you don't realise it. There's already been plenty of good advice given in this thread but the only way to really apply it is to just keep grinding out work, try to finish as many half-ideas as you can.

A few beginners pitfalls to watch out for:

* Watch the phrasing. The main melody doesn't/shouldn't always be playing. It's always a good idea to try singing your melody, if you find yourself struggling to catch a breath then you may need to adjust it. 
* You'd be surprised how much mileage you can get out of a simple idea. Try different chord progressions or voicings beneath your melody, play about with the rhythms.
*  Don't use block chords unless they actually contribute to the music. I always hated this in composition class when everyone would listen to each others' work. There were tons of pieces that fantastic melodies, counter melodies etc then when it came to the chords and bass it was all just basic triads and root notes being held until it was time to go to the next triad. Even the slightest bit of movement or harmonic alterations will go a long way.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-05-25 00:02:30 Salemosophy<br>Being able to understand "the relationship" (i.e. 'why' the movement works) between any two chords, using the following framework, makes it easy to construct chord progressions in real time. So, for anyone analyzing any tonal chord progression to see how it works (so you can reproduce it in some other way), these are also things to look for:

* Function - chords in tonal music function either as Tonic, Subdominant, or Dominant. 

* Primary/Auxiliary chords - Primary chords (i.e. I, IV, V) are related to Auxiliary chords (i.e. ii, iii, vi, vii) by common tones. 

* Common tones - notes that remain the same between two chords.

* 'Leading' tones - in a single voice, the movement by half step of one pitch to another pitch between two chords.

* Melodic Extensions - extended pitches (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, 13ths) of chords that occur in a melody/counter-melody are typically more "colorful" and tend to draw more attention than structural pitches (root, 3rds, 5ths). 

* Bass intervals - Loosely applied (so this is situational), bass voice movement tends to have a "progressive" or "regressive/stasis" effect on progressions. Progressive ascending intervals (2nds, 4ths, 6ths, 7ths) and progressive descending intervals (2nds, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) mirror each other. Regressive/Stasis intervals essentially "compliment" regressive intervals so regressive/stasis ascending intervals (unisons/octaves, 3rds, 5ths) and descending intervals (unisons/octaves, 4ths, 6ths) are a little easier to remember.

*Note: Not everyone agrees with the "bass interval" idea of progression and regression/stasis. But it comes from the simple idea (assuming the first chord is tonic) that when the bass proceeds immediately to another structural pitch of tonic, this creates LESS momentum than if the bass moves to the pitch of another chord. This is the basic premise of bass intervals and has proven helpful to me.* 

* Contrapuntal motion/preserving voice independence - if one or more voices move in the same direction, at least one voice should move in a different direction, with a different contour (steps vs skips vs leaps), or a combination of both. 

* Voicing simplified - most chords contain a root, a fifth, and at least one kind of "color" tone (usually the 3rd). Voice your root and fifth first, then explore to find the color(s) that work. 

Finally, a step-by-step guide to creating a progression from a melody/melodic fragment. 

1. Construct a melody/melodic fragment.

2. Construct a bass line. Analyze for both potential/implied function and melodic extensions. 

3. Flesh out the inner voices. Analyze for common/leading tones and counterpoint/voice independence among the voices. 

4. Analyze/edit for bass progression/regression/stasis and melodic contour/color against the harmonic progression. 

5. Details - let nothing be concrete until you are satisfied that every element/voice contributes its greatest potential to the whole. The smallest edits usually have the strongest impact. Be ready to change ANYTHING. 

Figuring all of this out on my own after 2 years of college music theory and 7 cumulative years of composition lessons has made writing so much simpler for me. I hope it does the same for others.

For example, many things that may sound "cheesy" to your average western ear are seen as perfectly acceptable, while simultaneously a lot of tropes that just seem typical and normal to the western ear are perceived as "ugly". I'm not talking about specific chord progressions or whatever, more like feelings within the music. So personally, I think you can't really boil it down to a couple simple tips like "use pentatonic and be jazzy" or whatever -- you have to get an intuitive understanding of what sort of elements are valued or avoided, and that leads you towards making many subtly different choices which end up resulting in something that feels "together", self-consistent and following its own set of rules, even though no hugely obvious differences may be apparent at first sight.

Some tips/personal opinions (not exhaustive by any means, and certainly plenty of examples break each of these suggestions, but as with all music theory, you have to know the "rules" before you can break them effectively):

Do:

* "Melancholic/nostalgic" feeling rather than all out cheery or sorrowful music. Some common devices include extended harmonies in the melodies (your Mr. Lawrence link is an excellent example, which by the way [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBctM3EwPno) is a video of the composer going through it with explanations, but no translation), but you have to know which ones to avoid (e.g. dominant 7ths are often substituted for something similar that sounds "prettier"), Satie and Debussy were *hugely* influential in this area, especially the massively popular [Gymnopedie No.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU).
* Counter melody. There's this thing called 合いの手(ainote), which I'm not sure how to translate, but basically you "reply" to the lead, filling their spaces, [clear (if over the top) example in this mash-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-_i0Ovf9hs). Even when not this clear, there is often something in the accompaniment filling an equivalent role.
* Traditional rhythms. Mostly derived from Taiko. A common example would be [quarter, quarter, eighth, quarter, quarter, quarter, eighth, half], but there are many others. The relative lack of syncopation is mostly influenced by this.
* Sus4: This is so common I had to mention it, although it only exploded in popularity relatively recently, so perhaps the sound isn't necessarily associated with "Japanese" just yet. Using sus4 either to give cadences more power or to smoothen modulations (especially to V/vi) is all the rage right now.
* Catchy melodies. Hardly something exclusive to Japan, but here is where all the pentatonic stuff comes in. Innovation at all costs is *way* less valued here, something cliched but perfected is strongly preferred over something innovative yet mediocre.
* Modulation. Especially at the chorus, but really everywhere. Most common may be 3 semitones up, often through bVI.
* Pretty/cute/easy and pleasant to listen to stuff.

Don't:

* Heavy, over the top syncopation. Moderate syncopation is actually very common, especially in the accompaniment, but also in the lead. [Here](http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm3582943) is an early 90s Japanese educational tv show covering syncopation for context, no subtitles but perhaps followable nonetheless.
* "Sharpening" chords (i.e. putting major chords where minor ones would usually go), unless softened by a sus4 (as mentioned earlier) or done on purpose to contrast with a "prettier" section (generally the chorus). It gives the music a harsh ring which is not very popular -- flattening is ubiquitous and appropriate.
* Angry stuff. Overly aggressive/abrasive vocals or instruments.
* Highly chromatic/irregular meters/excessively technical music.
* Lydian. Other modes are actually represented I'd say about the same as they are in the west, with perhaps Dorian (and Aeolian if you want to count it as a mode) *more* represented than over here (although mostly in video game music, but keep in mind that video game music is much more influential in Japan), and maybe Phrygian a bit less (but still common in metal-inspired video game music) -- but for whatever reason, Lydian is more or less non-existent. I suspect it's that "sharpened" feel I talked about earlier, but that's just my personal speculation.

Okay, getting way too wall-of-text-y so I'll stop here.

Counter-melody and traditional rhythms are two things that I find the most common among most Japanese pop music, even though some of the other stuff you mentioned is quite common. Those two elements are almost never missing. Plenty of Western artists have catchy melodies and some of the other stuff mentioned is really vague, but there is also a fair amount of modulation in Japanese music as well. 

The "Don't"s are a little harder to get behind since there's so many variables and exceptions to those, but this was a pretty good starting point for such a vast subject.

The most important line is the highest sounding note, and all of the other parts work down from there. Unlike in classical voice leading, where each part is supposed to be an interesting individual part, the goal in big band writing is to have every part blend together and sound like one giant voice. 

In classical voice leading, parallel motion, especially 5ths and 8ves is heavily discouraged. In big band writing, everything is parallel motion. The basic strategy is to come up with the top line for a part, and then to have all the horns in that section play a line with the exact same contour as the top line, only on different chord tones. The effect is that it fills out the sound by playing all of the chord tones, but because it is all parallel or oblique motion, the parts blend together and sound like one giant voice, with the highest sounding note dominating the mix. 

**So basically, writing for big band is about two things: coming up with the lines themselves. Writing the melodies and counter melodies that will make up the highest sounding voices. And then learning to harmonize the voices below the top notes.** 

----
**Writing the parts**

Coming up with the parts isn't all that tough. It can be a fun creative exercise. Just think of it like a duet, or a point/counterpoint. You have a melody assigned to one section (or to a singer or a soloist), and then you use the other horns to contrast that melody. It can be a conversation or an argument. Have fun with it. But there are a few stylistic things to be aware of:

**Hits** are short loud blasts of a just a few notes at a time. They are little interjections to the melody. They are typically syncopated, staccato, and played by the trumpets and trombones. 

**Pads** are longer notes that support the melody or soloist. They are quieter and more subdued than hits, and are usually provided by saxophones. They can be as simple as whole notes that outline the chord, or more rhythmically complex and repetitive, but usually not terribly complex.

**Counter Melodies** are also common. Usually at the ends of phrases, these little melodies are like a response to the main melody. You can think of it as a call/response, or as a standalone melody. 

Let's look for these stylistic things in the example you provided (sing sing sing):

* at 00:30 we hear the saxophone section playing the melody, while the brass provide hits.
* at 1:10 there is a clarinet solo, providing the melody. But in the background the horns are playing a repetitive pad (this is a little more rhythmically involved than typical pads, but it's an energetic song). At the ends of the phrases of his solos, the brass fill in with a little counter melody. 
* at 1:37 we have a 3-part build up. Though all 13-15 horns end up playing, there are really just 3 parts. First the trombones start with a driving line, then the trumpets add some long notes, and the saxophones provide an 8th note heavy counterpoint. This sort of section would be composed exactly like a trio from a march. It's almost fugue like. But again, we're just thinking about the top part of each section, and we will learn how to harmonize the voices below each part in a minute. 

And it just continues on like this: sometimes the saxophones have the melody and the brass provide hits. Sometiems the brass has a melody, and the saxophones provide pads or an 8th-note countermelody. Sometimes it's a 3-part thing and each section has its own line. But throughout it all, the composer, Louis Prima, was just writing individual lines 2 or 3 interacting, and then the arranger, Fletcher Henderson, harmonized those lines with some simple strategies that follow below. 

----
**Actually voicing the damn things.**

Okay, so you've written some parts, and you know what the top voice of each section is going to do, and now it's time to harmonize it to fill out the sound. This is probably more what your question was actually about. There are several voicing schemes, but they're all pretty easy. Let's say, over a C7 chord, you have the following line in the top voice:

    C Bb E

Here are some ways to harmonize that line:

**4-way closed**. This is for 4 voices (ie 4 trumpets), and is the simplest way to voice a chord. The strategy is this: treat every chord like a 7th chord, and have every voice play the next chord tone down from the one above it. So voice out in 4-way closed, that line would look like:

    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G

By starting at the top, and working your way down, you ensure that every voice ends up following the same contour as the top voice (in this case, small move down, then leap up). Every note ends up sounding like a fully-voiced dominant seventh chord, so the underlying C7 harmony is strong. It really is that simple. We don't worry about voice leading, or keeping the common tone, or avoiding parallel fifths. Everything is determined by the top voice. 

But 4-way closed has a couple of issues. One, it is very compact. If you want a bigger sound you want to spread your voices out a bit to cover more sonic range. And two, it makes it a little hard for the top line to stand out. Look at that first voicing. The top note is on a C, but right underneath it is a Bb, just a whole step away. It is nice to give the top line some breathing room, so that takes us to our next strategy:

**Drop-2**. Drop-2 is simple, and it comes from 4-way closed. All you do is take your 4-way closed voicing, and change one thing. You take the second note down from the top (the "2") and "drop" it down an octave. So in our example we take the notes of the 2nd voice (Bb G C), and make that the lowest sounding voice, leaving a little space for the top voice. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    
    Bb G  C

We've now spread our voices out a bit, so this provides a bigger sound, and we've given the top voice some breathing room. "drop-2" is the default big band voicing, and the most common one you will use and come across. It sounds great, and tends to fall into the ranges of brass sections really well. But there are more strategies. Oh so many more:

**Drop 2-4**. What if you want an even more open sound, with all of the voices spread out? Then you drop both the 2 and the 4. For this voicing, you take the 2nd line from the top, and the 4th line from the top (otherwise known as the bottom line) and drop them an octave. This can be a good way to move into the lower register of trombones or bari sax, giving a loud and big sound, while still having high notes on the top note of the voicing. Here's what it would look like on our same example:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    
    Bb G  C
    
    E  C  G

**Applying these ideas for 5 voices.** It is common to have 5 players playing a cohesive set of parst like this, especially in the saxophone section (the standard big band is 2 alto saxes, 2 tenor saxes, and 1 bari sax. 5 total). The simplest thing to do is to find a way to double the top line an octave lower. With 4-way closed, this puts the doubled-lead as the lowest voicing. This is neat, because the melody sandwiches all of the other parts. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    C  Bb E

This happens to work out well because it means that alto sax 1 and the bari sax are playing the exact same part, and octave apart. The bari sax is an octave lower than an alto, so it amounts to them reading the same music. Convenient and cool. 

For drop-2 the double lead fills the space left between the rest of the voices and where the dropped voice ends up. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C

We basically wind up with a block of 4 voices in 4-way closed, with a gap and then a melody on top of that. Cool. 

In Drop 2-4, the doubled lead ends up sandwiched in the middle of the sound: 

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    
    E  C  G

This is a huge sound. You have a solid block of 3 voices in the middle, and a lead voice with some breathing room on top and a bass voice with some breathing room on the bottom. It's very dramatic. I'm a fan.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-10-01 02:13:48 MiskyWilkshake<br>The TL;DR version is that you want to achieve independence in your voices, so that each line that builds up your harmony sounds like a separate self-contained melody, rather than just part of the whole. The way this is achieved is through contrary motion and not maintaining the same interval-relationship between two voices for very long (especially when that interval relationship is a particularly strong one, like an octave or a fifth).

The way this is generally taught is through species counterpoint, which is  basically a set of rules and constraints through which you must compose. Methods and rules for species counterpoint differ according to who you ask, but the really condensed version is as follows:

**First Species Counterpoint:** Write a simple melody, called your Cantus Firmus, around which you will compose your counterpoint. Traditionally, this is done with a single note duration (semibreves, say), and kept as simple as possible. Let's use the notes C-D-E-C-F-E-D-C for example. Now... the first rule is that neither your cantus firmus, nor the counterpoint you create over the top should contain leaps of a seventh, nor any augmented or diminished intervals. Next, you must compose a melody over the top which consists entirely of the harmonic intervals of unison, M/m3, P5, M/m6, and octaves. Seconds, fourths, sevenths, and tritones are seen as dissonances, and are avoided. This melody should be exactly note-for-note (rhythmically speaking) with your cantus firmus, so it too will use a single note-value (semibreves in this case). You may tie notes. Most composers suggest that in order to give a sense of cadence, your contrapuntal melody should begin and end on the unison, octave, or fifth (some do not even permit the fifth). Some composers suggest avoiding unisons except at the beginning and end, for maximum independence. You must try and keep your melodic motion of the two voices as contrary as possible (when one voice goes down, the other should be going up), therefore you should avoid using more than 1 consecutive octave or fifth, and avoid more than 3 consecutive thirds or sixths. You should also try to avoid 'hidden' parallel fifths, which are when you approach a single perfect fifth or octave by similar motion instead of oblique or contrary motion (this is sometimes allowed if the interval is approached in one part by a semitone step, or the interval is approached in the higher part by step, but for the sake of maximum independence, let's avoid it entirely). When you are forced to use similar or parallel motion (parallel being where the two voices move in the same direction by the same number of steps, and similar being when they move in the same direction by different numbers of steps), at least one of the voices must be moving by step - they cannot both skip in the same direction. Finally, try to keep your two parts within a tenth of each other, unless an exceptionally pleasing line can be written by moving outside of that range. Similarly, the two parts should never cross. Your final note must be approached by step. If the final is approached from below, then the leading tone must be raised in a minor key. You may also raise the sixth near the cadence in order to avoid aug/dim intervals.

Remember, both melodies need to feel like melodies, so good melody-writing should still occur: they need to sound pleasant on their own, as well as together. Try to counter all your skips with stepwise motion in the opposite direction, and to make sure that your overall melodic contour is pleasing, with a single melodic peak, and no difficult leaps. Try to also avoid having two skips in the same direction. For stylistic accuracy, you should also try to avoid creating intervals of tritones (for example, an ascending melodic motion F - A - B♮) or sevenths (C - A - B♮) in three notes. I often find that this last rule is less important than many of the others, and can be ignored if you are not aiming for stylistic accuracy.

An example of good first-species counterpoint on our C-D-E-C-F-E-D-C cantus firmus would be C-B-G-A-A-B-B-C. Notice how it starts and ends on the octave, the voices move in opposite directions each step of the way, and how the only fifth is approached by contrary motion.

 **Second Species Counterpoint:** Here, you will have no more than two notes in your contrapuntal line for every note in your cantus firmus. In the example we're using of a cantus firmus written in semibreves, we'll thus be writing out contrapuntal line in minims. Here, you may use harmonic intervals of a second and fourth, but they must be treated as dissonances. The accented beat must have only consonance, and your dissonances must fall on the unaccented beat, but only as a passing tone, i.e. it must be approached and left by step (half or whole) in the same direction. Unisons may also be used mid-piece now, but must be used only on the unaccented beat. If you'd like, you may begin on an upbeat, leaving a half-rest in the added voice.

An example of good second-species counterpoint would be: || rest - A | D - C | B - E | D - A | B - C# | D || over the cantus firmus || D | F | G | F | E | D ||. Notice how the dissonances are on the unaccented beats, and treated as passing notes, and how the leading tone C is raised to a C#.

**Third Species Counterpoint:** Here, you may use up to four notes in your contrapuntal line for every note in your cantus firmus. Remember that dissonances must be resolved by step to consonants, except for a few exceptions. The three exceptions are as follows:

1) Cambiata: The dissonance in the dissonant cambiata is approached by descending step and occurs on a weak half or quarter of the beat; the skip from the dissonance must be a descending third to a consonance; and this consonance must be followed by some number of ascending steps. This means there are only three possible essential dissonant cambiatas in third species: Two above the cantus firmus, with vertical intervals 8-7-5-6 and 6-b5-3-4; and one below, with 3-4-6-5. This idea may also be inverted, with one inverted form above the cantus firmus: 3-4-6-5; and two below: 8-7-5-6 and 6-b5-3-4.

2) Double passing tones: A double passing tone allows two dissonant passing tones in a row. The figure would consist of 4 notes moving in the same direction by step. The two notes that allow dissonance would be beat 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3) Double Neighbours: The upper and lower tones are prepared on beat 1 and resolved on beat 4. The 5th note or downbeat of the next measure should move by step in the same direction as the last two notes of the double neighbour figure. 

Otherwise, all usual rules apply.

An example of good third-species counterpoint would be || D - C - A - B | C - A - B - C | B - C - E - D | C - B - A - F | G - A - B - C# | D || over the cantus firmus || D | F | G | F | E | D ||.

**Fourth Species Counterpoint:** In fourth species counterpoint, we go back to two contrapuntal notes for each note in your cantus firmus, only we're going to be tying some of these notes across the barline. The idea here is that you write second-species counterpoint, but when you have a consonance on the weak beat, you can tie it across to the next bar, even if it creates a dissonance with the new cantus firmus note. That way, you can have dissonances on the strong beats of bars. These dissonances must still resolve by step to a consonance. Because each of the dissonant notes starts as a consonance on the previous cantus firmus note, you can chain multiple of these suspensions together to create a syncopated feel.


An example of good fourth species counterpoint would be || r - E | (E) - D | (D) - C | (C) - B | (B) - C | D - F | G - C | F - D | E || over the cantus firmus || C | D | E | D | G | F | E | D | C ||, where r is a rest, and bracketed notes are tied from the previous non-bracketed notes. Note how the B in bar 4 is tied across to bar 5, even though it is consonant against the G in the cantus firmus. This is of course permitted, as you may place consonants with impunity.

**Fifth Species Counterpoint:** (Also known as Florid Counterpoint). You've made it to the last one! Don't worry, this one's the easiest and the freest of them all! This one's just about combining all the others you've learned. You're free to do so as you please, so long as you're following the rules. Feel free to throw in some dotted notes and interesting rhythms for good measure.

Since there's so little to say about this one, I thought I'd throw in some other useful tips and things to consider. The first thing that I'd suggest is just to help you avoid mistakes, and that's to identify where the tritone interval lies in your mode BEFORE you start composing. For example, if you're writing in Cmaj, bearing in mind that the only diatonic tritone is between the notes B and F, then it's easier to avoid than trying to spot and change it after you've written (especially since it can't occur between three notes - which is harder to spot). Another thing I'd suggest is to try swapping things around and writing your contrapuntal line BELOW the cantus firmus, rather than above it. Another thing you might want to do is to try transposing or doubling either your cantus firmus, or your contrapuntal line at the octave - bear in mind that if you're doing this, you must treat ONLY unisons, thirds, sixths, and octaves as consonances, and not fifths. The reason for this lies in how intervals invert. Unisons invert to octaves, thirds invert to sixths, sixths invert to thirds, and octaves invert to unisons, but fifths invert to dissonant fourths, and therefore, fifths can't be treated as consonances when transposed at the octave. For something even more fun, what about transposing at the fifth? Well... transposed at the fifth, The unison transposes to the fifth, so that can be treated as a consonance, the octave transposes to the twelfth, which is equivalent to a fifth, and thus also consonant, the third transposes to the tenth, which is equivalent to a third, and thus also consonant, and the fifth transposes to the octave, and is thus consonant, HOWEVER, the sixth transposes to the second, and is thus dissonant, and can't be treated as a consonance.

PHEW! That's it, you're practically Bach already! Next step, fugues!

Hope that makes sense to you! Let me know if you're having trouble following, or don't understand anything I've said so far. Also, please feel free to correct me if I've made any mistakes.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-10-25 14:09:27 Salemosophy<br>It's situational, obviously, but in a huge contrapuntal setting I usually begin with the melody, then bass line, then inner voices. Here are the things I think about as I go about it:

* What is the general contour of my melodic line? I look for steps, skips, leaps, and direction upward or downward.
* How can I make the bass line independent? In relation to the melody, I try to move my bass line in opposing motion to the melody, both in direction AND in steps/skips/leaps. This way, my bass line moves independently from the melody.
* What does the melody/bass line combination imply harmonically? Here is where I consider possible progressions and just store those possibilities to utilize later in the process. This is also where I initially consider function and make adjustments to the bass line where needed.
* From here, it's a matter of filling in my inner voices. Since we have a directional line from our melody and another from our bass voice, the question becomes whether or not to move in reference to the melody or in reference to the bass. This is a purely aesthetic decision.
* Once an initial 4-part harmony is established, I go analyze for accuracy of harmonic function. Does the harmony move in a logical pattern of function of TS, TD, or TSD (where T=Tonic, S=Subdominant, and D=Dominant)? Of course, I reduce every chord down to its function (in major - I, vi, &amp; iii = Tonic; IV, ii = Subdominant; and V, vii^o = Dominant). For me, it's strictly a mental process, but if this is new, it helps to note it in your analysis. For borrowed chords (like bVI or II), I simply stick to their corresponding function in the key from which I borrowed them (so bVI would be a Tonic substitution while II would be a Subdominant Substitution). 
* From here, I tweak the voices and look for opportunities to make inner voices more fluid (or maybe even more connected to the material - like a counter melody or an imitation of another voice). If the melody moves by perfect 5th, maybe I can imitate that in the alto voice later, or maybe the bass line descends by a few steps and I can counter-act this motion with the tenor ascending by a few steps. Aesthetic decisions.
* Once I've reached this point, I have a pretty strong idea of what the passage wants to be. I've given each voice enough consideration to warrant its inclusion in the texture of the passage. It either supports what I'm doing by adding harmonic context, compliments another line with contrapuntal motion, or imitates what other voices are doing.

Here are a few simple tips:

* Learn and absorb the harmonic series for clearer results in voicing. Think of this like a "grid" upon which to assign pitches rather than guessing which voice should have which pitch of a chord. Think linearly as well about how a movement up or down could model the series. 
* If you're working with a large ensemble (especially band and orchestra), understand that you can assign harmonic fabric to a particular family of instruments and free up other instruments to compliment the fabric in other ways (gestures, unison or octave doubling of melody, driving rhythms, etc).
* Especially between Bass and Tenor voicings, one trick I've discovered is to alternate between octave and perfect fifth intervals, often resulting in a contrapuntal texture between the two voices. This saves me a lot of time in creating contrary lines because I'm already caring for the root or root &amp; fifth of the resulting harmony.
* Use chord inversions to smooth out your bass line. One example might be a bass line that moves up diatonically by step. In a I-V-I situation in C Major, for example, this might mean a C Maj, G7/D, C Maj/E or I, V4/3, I6. 
* Consider how some bass line intervals might tend to progress or regress the harmonic motion of the passage. Descending 2nds, 3rds, and 5ths along with ascending 2nds, 4ths, and 6ths might tend to progress harmonic motion while the compliment to that (descending 4ths and 6ths as well as ascending 3rds and 5ths) might tend to regress harmonic motion. As you're fleshing out your passage, start thinking about how interval motion in the bass affects your harmonic progression. 
* It's perfectly fine to move harmonically from root to root, so don't try to make it overly complicated with inverted chords right away. See what happens when you flesh out the passage with clearly voiced, root position chords first, and then find areas where it doesn't work and consider revising to an inverted chord for clearer movement of voices. 
* If the melody has the root, consider an inversion so the bass voice isn't producing the same pitch. Otherwise, try to keep the melodic line playing the structural 3rds, 5ths, or especially the color tones (basically, any chord extension of 7th or above) of any chord. This gives the melody prominence within the texture. You can work this out early by avoiding octave doubling between melody and bass lines. 
* Don't dwell on harmonic analysis until you absolutely need to. So what if you have an E in your melody and a Bb in your bass? The time to think about anything like that is much further along in the process. Focus on listening to your voices and what they "want" to be doing. You can work out the harmonic analysis later, or not at all for that matter. As long as it works, go with it. If anything, let the theorists slave away on analyzing it to death long after you're dead... or something. Sorry, that got really morbid there for a second.

Analyze works you like and see how composers voice their harmonic textures. Pick up scores/sheet music of songs and study them. Rewrite them, verbatim if you need to, and see what the voices are doing as you write them out. Are they moving in a particular way that's consistent with your ideal genre of music? Also, try to find tunes that make you think, "Man, this would be so much better if they'd done [this thing] instead," and try to implement that thing. 

Move voices around. Study how this affects the harmonic progression. Tweak things you've already heard to make them sound more like you. I guarantee this is how many of the most renowned composers learned their craft. It didn't really begin with theory for them. It began much later. Analyze for things OTHER THAN harmony. Come up with your own system of analysis for things like motifs, melodic contour, contrary motion, and so on. According to Jan La Rue, there are 5 elements of music - Sound (Timbres), Harmony, Melody, Rhythm, and Growth (Form). Try making "down and dirty" analyses of your favorite tunes by listening for these elements. See what happens from one passage of music to the next. What gets added? What gets taken away? How do these elements create impact? 

Anyway, this is my process. Give it a shot and tweak it to your style.

Meh, I'm not saying that this is definitively true, but so far, in my (not-so-broad-but-hopefully-broad-enough) experience, it has been, and I have some trust that my experience is at least somewhat representative.

&gt; If your argument is that only Western culture has developed Western-style harmony, that's invariably true but a tautological argument with little value.

It is my argument, but I don't think it's actually tautological.  The rules of melody and rhythm, which is a subject directly related to the original post, are in a sense universal (well, not quite), whereas the rules of harmony -- rules which govern Western-style harmony, specifically -- apply only to Western music.  I don't think my definition is *biased* towards Western music; I'd say my definition *is* Western music.  And I also don't think that any other traditional culture has come up with anything even *resembling* Western-style harmony without direct European influence.  Whatever word you want to use for these cultures' handling of multiple tones at the same time, it doesn't even come close to having tonics and subdominants and such.  And of course, there's a good reason: for the most part, they don't use temperaments that lend themselves to harmony.

For example, I've been listening to a lot of Arabic music recently, which uses quarter tones (by which I generally mean notes in the 24-tone scale that are not in the 12-tone scale, not the interval of 50 cents) quite a bit.  I've done a bit of exploring with quarter tones outside of the context of Arabic music as well, and quarter tones do *not* work well in chords.  We have this system of fifths for harmony, and these fifths make a circle that closes and leaves the rest of the 24-tone scale out.  And you can tell when you listen to Arabic music because it's mostly heterophonic or monophonic.  One melodic line in the singers and melodic instruments, with some occasional ornamentation, but usually not more than that, and there's no bass line other than one that highlights or follows the melody.  This is because these notes sound *bad* with the 12-tone scale!  Then you get to the gamelan, which uses 7-tone and 9-tone scales (at the same time, with the exact tuning differing from gamelan to gamelan), and of course there's no way to get harmony from that either.  Harmony is built into the Western system, and other systems (at least that I've come across) are simply not built this way at all.

That's not to say that harmony requires the modern 12-tone equal temperament that we generally know and use.  Far from it.  But the theoretical underpinnings of harmony are actually important, and other cultures simply did not take the same approach that the Europeans did, inheriting the theory from the Greeks and refining it with mathematics and the general path that music took throughout Europe.  There's nothing superior or inferior about it.  It's just the way history turned out.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-11-29 08:03:07 las5h4<br>I was just listening to this song, [I Want To Be Well by Sufjan Stevens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO17WyaU2mE) earlier today.  Now I've listened to this song a million times because I'm a huge Sufjan fan, so there's several things about this song that I've noticed and find fascinating and which pertain to this discussion. So the whole climax of the song is built off of a descending D-flat Major scale.  The first time we hear it at 0:26, it's veiled in some pretty complex harmonies and it isn't repeated, not to mention it's tonally out-of context (the song has been in A-flat Major-ish so far).  We hear it in this context again at 0:58.  At 1:44, we have our modulation into D-flat Major, but there's still borrowed chords and modal extensions all over the place.  At 2:27, he says "remember that descending  D-flat Major scale from earlier that made no sense?" and at 2:34 he says "Let me strip that down for you and repeat it a thousand times."  At 3:16, he finally brings in a counter-melody, but the entire time in the background he is layering more and more background vocals which are just repetitive diatonic scales.  So we're growing in intensity, and by 3:58 we pretty much have a round of diatonic descending D-flat Major scales, but it's still interesting because it's all being framed by this harmonic progression.  But hey, look at the harmonic progression - the bass goes G-flat, F, E-flat, D-flat, B-flat, A-flat.  If you start the rotation with B-flat, you have the last six notes of a descending D-flat Major scale.  So that scale is pretty much the  only thing going on, and this all repeats and intensifies until this end of the song, and it's pretty sweet.

Sufjan probably stole this device from [Arvo Pärt's Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-xbhfNR2g) [(wiki page)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantus_in_Memoriam_Benjamin_Britten) which is just a desending A Minor scale repeated at various speeds.  It comes across as a very dynamic piece though.

The synth lines in [this Animal Collective song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogm80UNfKr8) wouldn't be that interesting if they weren't doing such weird polyrhythms, but AnCo makes it interesting.  That's the thing about scales, they really can easily sound lazy or boring, but it's about the context you put it in.  John Coltrane used scales to death, but it still sounds insane and amazing.  I'm sure Philip Glass, Steve Reich, John Adams all have examples sort of like these, but whether it's minimalism or bebop or indie rock, there has to be some ingenuity to make it work, in my opinion.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-12-09 22:48:00 Indosay<br>Not sure of any resources, but I think the best thing to do would be to listen to some bands or songs that you like and see what they do.  Learn what chords they're using and how they get from verse to chorus, etc.  

Another point on actually working out other parts is something I picked up from some metal guitar player.  Can't remember who, but it was some video I watched years ago.  He was discussing how he writes riffs and says that he'll just start playing something, some random riff.  He may hate almost all of it after a few play throughs, but if there's one part he likes, he'll keep that part and discard the rest and try to write another riff centered around the original part that he liked.  If he finds some more parts that he likes, he'll add those and discard the new sections he doesn't like and write a 3rd riff doing the same thing.  He just follows this pattern, keeping bits that he really likes and discarding bits he doesn't, until he has a cohesive riff that he really likes.  I do the same when writing chords a lot of the time.  Write a verse progression and maybe I'll end up liking 2 of the 4 or 6 chords and keep those two and try to find new chords to fill in.  Or maybe it just needs different voiceings for some of the chords, or a different octave or whatever.  But even if you only find one chord you really like the first time around, keep that chord and try to find a 2nd, then a 3rd, etc.  Or heck, maybe your verse just needs two chords, or even one with a fun melody / counter melody.  

Hope that makes sense and isn't too rambly.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-01-31 04:39:50 chimechord<br>The reason why you can sing songs that you normally play different chords to is that the modern day system of western music is relative. You can always transpose the music. The easiest way to think about it from a guitarists perspective is to think about how the capo works: When using the capo, you can play exactly the same chord forms while at the same time making the chords sound different (higher in pitch). For example, if I would have put a capo on the first fret while playing your chord progression (G, E5, C, D) using the original fingerings the chords would now be called Ab F5 Db and Eb. Soundwise, it's different, but you can still sing the same melody lines you sung before, but now in a different pitch. If you continue the journey with the capo, new chords will pop up: If the capo was on the 5th fret the chords would be called C, A5, F, G and if the capo was on the 7th fret the chords would be called D, B5, G, A. You maybe recognize some of these are the chords for the songs you were implying in the original post?

You still play the same left hand fingering, but the sounds are changing, the pitch is changing. The relationship between the chords are still the same though, and that is what answers your question. You can, since the modern western system of music is relative, transpose the chords while still maintaining the same relationship between them. To understand this fully you need to understand that the major scale (from which the chords you are using are built from) has seven notes and that each of these seven notes can function as a starting point for building chords. These seven notes are in one [system of theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral_analysis) just given a numer (I ii iii IV V vi and vii). By thinking in this way, everything is very easily transposable. The chords you are using are built from the G major scale which contains the notes G A B C D E and F#. One way of analyzing it would be to call the chords I vi IV V (G being one, E being six, C being four and D being five). Here's a wikipedia page dedicated to that specific chord progression: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50s_progression

Try to learn a little bit about chord progressions, it can really open your mind about music. One good starting point would be to learn the so called I IV V progression in every key. Starting in the key of E and moving counter clockwise in the [circle of fifths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths) you would get the chord progressions: E, A, B (key of E), A, D, E (key of A), D, G, A (key of D), G, C, D (key of G, three of the chords used in your chord progression), C, F, G (key of C), F, Bb, C (key of F) and so on. All these chord progressions are "the same", just at different pitches. You could switch between one or the other and still sing the same melodies on top.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-02-03 03:55:33 mfranko88<br>So is this a good way to think of it:

Counter point is a supporting role to the melody. There is only one melody that the counterpoint helps to accentuate and make more interesting

Counter melody is literally a second melody that happens to be going at the same time

??
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-02-03 11:37:44 MiskyWilkshake<br>I would disagree. I would even say that the opposite is more true. The rules of counterpoint are specifically designed to try to create independence between the voices and strengthen the sense of polyphony, rather than have them play a homophonic role, supporting a single melody.

As far as I see it, counter-melody is just counterpoint without the rules, which means that it can become a lot more parallel, and homophonic.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-03-26 15:27:59 xiipaoc<br>&gt;  does counter melodies should be in another voice of SATB or you can write another melody for a same voice ?

Really depends on who your singers are, doesn't it?  If you have two sopranos, you probably wouldn't want to make your countermelody voice a tenor.  Just saying.

&gt; Or i need to pay attention to bass too, to avoid clashes between counter melody and a bass?

Try writing without avoiding clashes with the bass and see how it sounds.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-05-10 11:22:58 jesucont01<br>It is practice in learning to write a counter line, or lines, to a melody original or not.  This is what Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, etc.  all used to practice the art and craft of writing counterpoint to their own material. It is really about the illusion of independent lines of music.

At this point, the vocal melody is singing 4 beat phrases. At 0:51 the horn melody is looped every 4-beats. This is another giveaway that the tune is in 4/4.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-07-02 15:58:31 LarryLarington<br>Before I jump on your points, just a few general thoughts about the article:

When I started reading the article, I actually felt entirely unconvinced by Stankis' thesis. The connection of Ravel's music to cloisonne and "the uninterrupted circle" just seemed like an unsubstantial comparison that would only end up over-complicating a style of music already rife with complexity, but boy am I glad that I finished the article. While some of the comparisons between music and visual art were tough for me to accept, (ex: comparing ornamentation to the foaming tips of a wave), Stankis' ideas regarding brush strokes and counterpoint in tone characters really intrigued me.

The idea that you can push counterpoint past pitches and into larger forms like contours, ideas and actions is something I've probably come across before, but no writing has really made me think about this idea more than Stankis' article. The part where she described the strokes personifying the actions of the grasshopper and the aura of the forest kind of reminded of Mussorgsky's Pictures of an Exhibition Suite mov. II Gnomus and made me re-evaluate how exactly contour affects our perception of movement and action.

You mention that you felt something missing in her discussion, and I have to agree with you. I thought she could have taken her ideas "up one more level" to really solidify how though this is an interesting way to analyze Ravel's music, he likely wasn't writing his music paying attention to every little "stroke of the brush." I get more of a sense from the excerpts that they are formed from the counterpoint of her more macroscopic concept of tone characters. Just as in tonal counterpoint where each voice needs a unique rhythm and melody to contrast other voices, each tone character needs a unique "feel" to contrast other tone characters. 

Since we cannot be positive how Ravel came up with these contrasting motives (and it's even worse to speak for him), it makes more sense to me to address that he put these motives in counterpoint and a brush-stroke analysis shows visually how they innately contrast. From the way she builds up her concepts it almost feels as if she implies that Ravel created these pieces by thinking, "this squiggle needs to counter this dash." I don't know, just a stronger acknowledgement that it's a tool for analysis more so than a definitive modus operandi would help. I could potentially be reading a bit too much into this. Hey it's late.

Anyway, thanks for posting this article! I feel like these ideas are more inspiring from a composition perspective than an analytical one (for me personally), so I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of music this line of thinking can create with conscious application. Might actually be harder than just letting the ideas flow naturally! 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-07-22 09:45:06 ProgKibble<br>Haha your right, been a while since I played it. :p
I was trying to re harmonise the melody in a way that removed the dissonance. 
Yea, it's a long tune with all those different combinations of melodies and counter melodies. Heard the Pokemon green beta version? That's even crazier! 
Edit: The link was my band btw, bad luck with the sound guy.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-08-07 22:01:29 Salemosophy<br>Okay, so here is "my approach" to this, and it's almost more a question of orchestration than of counterpoint. 

In learning counterpoint, we study four-part writing with a structure of Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass (SATB for short). When we branch out into orchestration, we can be a bit more discerning of elements in our music. We have textures in music that we learn about in orchestration:

* monophonic (solo, unison),
* homophonic (chorale with unified harmonic rhythm),
* polyphonic (chorales with syncopations, suspensions, passing tones, etc), and 
* heterophonic (think of a round like "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" or "Frere Jacques"). 

There may be more, but the point is that when we get to the question of combining ideas in compositions, we're combining elements crafted within these textural structures. We're combining monophonic ideas with homophonic texture (the result being what most consider a polyphonic texture). We might have an idea that's strictly homophonic - a progression of two chords even (think of the motif/theme to the Batman Begins/Dark Knight/DKRises trilogy). We could have an idea set in a round that some might call 'imitation' across voices if it doesn't occur throughout the passage. We could have a Fugue setting or even a Passacagalia. 

So let's get back to your question. In the strictest sense, a homophonic passage doesn't necessarily need a melody. It can certainly have a melody over it - the result being a polyphonic texture - or it could simply be a melody in the soprano voice with the other voices accompanying that melody below it (also polyphonic). In large orchestration (think a full concert band or orchestra), we can usually identify settings like:

* tutti sections (every instrument plays the same thing within their own registers - huge impacts)
* motor rhythms (some instruments might have ostinato figures that repeat)
* harmonic component (some instruments might be devoted to the chords)
* melodic component (some instruments might be devoted to the motif, theme, or longer melody of a tune)
* counter-melodic component (some instruments might play a melody that imitates or counters a motif, theme, or melody)
* effect (some instruments might be devoted to producing a sound effect - e.g. a muted trumpet "whinnies" like a horse at the end of "Sleigh Ride")

There are probably more components - anything is possible. But I hope this clarifies the role of counterpoint in harmonic texture. There's a bigger, larger framework in composition where counterpoint comes into play that you're probably not aware of yet. And the basic principles you're learning about now are the same when applied to the larger structures you create with some exceptions of course when we're not dealing specifically with harmony. 

EDIT: You may eventually learn how to craft bass lines from melodies using contrapuntal strategies, but that takes time and experience. For now, just learn how to avoid the pitfalls of counterpoint - parallel fifths, octaves, contrary motion, and contrary interval movement. Once you've got that down, you can start worrying about applying your strategies to melodic content on a larger scale. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-08-13 02:28:49 nmitchell076<br>One trick I learned that helped me deal with fugue subjects. 

1.) Start with a standard chord progression in 3 or 4 voices. Something like a descending chain of 7-6 suspensions or something. 

2.) Craft your subject out of one of the voices of this melody (or maybe two and do it as a compound melody). 

3.) Craft your counter subjects / other voices out of the remaining voices. 

4.) then use these strands as "building blocks" and build your exposition out of them. Having these blocks ready in advance will make the process of composition much easier. 

Also, something similar to your "I once thought that each player played their own melody" thing: don't spend all your time in 4 voices! A four voice fugue might spend 70% of its time only using 3 of its voices, another 10% might be spent using only 2 voices, and only 20% might use all four voices at once (and even here, a bass voice might only be doing a pedal point or something). This makes it easier on you and your performers. You don't have to worry about four whole voices going on all the time. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-08-29 23:25:54 longwayahead<br>Not a fugue. The word 'fugue' comes from fuga – to chase or to flee. Imagine voice 1 has the theme/motive (we'll call this the 'subject').

So voice 1 states the subject in the tonic, followed by voice 2 in the dominant, followed by voice 3 in the tonic and so on until all parts of the texture have stated the original subject.

Here's the kicker: while voice 2 is stating the subject (with which voice 1 has just finished), voice 1 starts stating the counter-melody that goes with the subject ('counter-subject'). A 'legal' counter-subject has to be worked out on scrap paper by the composer before hand. Each voice passes the subject on to the next voice (voice 1-&gt;voice 2 etc) after they've had a go at it and then do the same with the counter subject after they've had a go at that too.

The subject appears to chase itself around between all the voices.

(If any of the above is confusing, there are great posts on here breaking down the terminology.)

I would say that because this piece begins (or appears to) in the tonic C major, the subject that should follow in the next voice should be entered on G major, not A minor as this one is. It doesn't have to be a literal restatement (look up real versus tonal fugue subjects).

Canons have to be a literal restatement of the original theme. This means that tone and semitone steps are preserved. Canons don't have to continue by starting again on the unison, though this is the most common form of canon-writing. They can begin on any scale degree as long as the tone-semitone steps are preserved.

Canons are the strictest form of voice-writing.

Sorry if this wasn't altogether clear, but hope it starts you on the path to discovering what an amazing world that of counterpoint and fugue is.

Look up Johann Froberger's early work. This is a fantastic way to discover simpler early fugue and practise practise practise!!!

The ear hears the top and bottom note more easily from the rest. the notes between them will interact with each other more and tend to make the inner voices blend together. In old HiFi days on the better rigs, this was measured with a term called intermodulation distortion. With a low IM Distortion you could hear the inner voices much clearer than on a regular record player, for example. 

On a guitar, if the player plays a 6 note chord the two E strings will be more prominent everything else being equal 

This is why old time rhythm guitarists did lots of 6 string chords as they blended together to form a sort of "sound block" of the chord and you heard the pulse of the block of sound defining the chord quality and when played rhythmically created a pulse to emphasize the rhythm. Add the lead guitar and the bass and you had the low notes on the bass combining with the rhythm guitar with the pulse or counter pulse in the bottom and the lead guitar playing melody or melodic licks that would stick out more because of the same above reasons.  The singer then would be on top of the rhythm guitar and bass and the lead guitarist would work with the singer so as not to conflict and muddy each of their prominent placings in the orchestration. 

The same principles apply to all genres of music. 

The reason that too much harmony in the lower ranges is muddy is related by physics to the structure of the Harmonic series. This natural series of overtones that is found in every musical note starts out very widely spaced and increasingly closer together as the series gets higher and as it gets higher, the overtones get softer. So the most naturally effective orchestration of notes starts widely spaced like an octave above the lower note then a  fifth then a fourth then a third then a minor third then a note between that note and the next 4th and then to whole steps and half steps and then quarter tones etc, 

Now, mixing techniques can alter some of these natural tendencies I mention but these characteristics still are present and generally, in all genres, these principles will win out except if you are into special effects. 
 
Now also, if you leave space in an orchestration, the space that is empty will allow the melody played in that space to stand out more than it would normally be heard. 

I hope that this helps the OP to understand better what he asked. 

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-12-01 03:09:38 ljse7m<br>Its hard to explain some things without a knowledge of the terms of music theory so I will try to guess what you mean specifically. Then the more you inquire, the more accurate I will get if I am wrong in my assumption. 

There are two methods that come to mind from what you ask. 
1. The back track singer is using a parallel third or sixth of the melody staying in the key. This works on simple songs and the harmony line might change occasionally or go to  unison or octave to avoid major clashes with the harmony. 

2.  Many singers can improvise or create a harmony line simply by singing a counter melody that follows the melody in rhythm but used standard voice leading connections of the harmony. For this, the singer needs to be able to hear the harmony (not necessary to be schooled in voice leading by book learning, but must be learned by ear of, for example, the way Bach connects his voices in his chorales. Its not as hard to do this by ear as you might first imagine. Many singers pick up on both these techniques very easily. 

Did you sing in a choir? That would be a way to study this without going to school. But its easier if the choir  uses Bach type of arrangements but any choir would get you more connected to your voice and that would help, just not as clear cut as if you were singing bach. 

But you can find in most theory books, a presentation of the natural voice leading of each voice when they are explaining how to write in  Bach style during the freshman year of study at school. 

IF you want more details or if I am off in my assumptions, give me more info and I can respond better. 
Still, its a good question and personally, I don't care if you studied theory or not. I specialize teaching those that don't like to study theory. I have no problem teaching a student to HEAR theory. If they want the book version, I give it to them. If not. I teach on a need to know basis the theory you need to know to do what you want to do. 
I am interested to see what kind of responses you get from this post. 
The one I see here already seems to be from a self taught and its not bad except he talks about building a chord but  not really about the melodic improvisation that is used by the professional back ground singers. A well trained back ground singer works a lot because they can improvise the back tracks on the fly and all the producer needs to do is tell them what to say and when to say it. They can make a lot of cash in the studio if they are good!

Listen to Count Basie Orchestra or Beethoven or Stan Kenton or Rachmaninoff or Mozart. Do they utilize every member of the orchestra for every note? No they do not. Big chords should happen when you need lots of voices, little chords happen when you need fewer voices. When Barry Harris plays, he isn't just playing chords, even his inner voicings tend to have shape and motion. Your question is not one about playing the piano, your question is one about thinking compositionally. Here is a great trick go starting to learn to comp with these various techniques. Go listen to the Basie Band playing Freckle Face, now strip away all the main melodies, and see how Sammy Nestico uses various compositional techniques to drive the band and make the music more exciting. Sometimes, there are single note background fills, sometimes behind a smooth and sultry melody, the band will all of a sudden jump to FFF for a measure or two before jumping right back down to ppp. Listening to and emulating Big band music is a great way to hone your piano chops because it gets you thinking more compositionally. I'm sure your already working on your voicings and you can already play some hip stuff, now lets use those skills to make MUSIC, and not just play the piano. There's a few really great youtube videos by Dick Hyman explaining the use of various styles of block chords. He talks about how someone like Erroll Garner would play the piano is 2 pretty starkly separate styles, he would play single lines emulating a Sax soloist, then jump to a 4 or 5 note block chords voicing for a different section of the chart in order to emulate a trumpet section. This is a great way to start getting out of your comfort zone and start to do what you seek: emulate a full band when you play and think compositionally. Some general begining practice tips for switching between small and big chords. Method 1(easy mode) Play small chords on the A sections of tunes and play big  chords on the Bridge. Method 2(the Sammy Nestico/Basie Big Band method) Play single note lines and counteract and punctuate hour melodies with short big chord stabs or counter melodies. Method 3 (forward motion) start with small ideas and as the piece goes along start incorporating more and more voices as you go along till your playing like a full band. Now keep in mind, these are just practice methods, if you play a whole piece or a whole gig sticking to strickly those methods I described, your gonna find yourself in a pidgeon hole and running out of ideas. Real music is much more organic then that, plus there are a plethora of other factors that would stop that from being successful (like the fact that you must follow whom ever is soloing at the time) But the object is to get you practicing switching back and forth between voicing types and get your comfortable with either style. Hope this was helpful!

It is like a lead sheet in Jazz performances except that the rules of part writing are those of the Baroque period. 

The keyboardist has all the info he needs to do his part with the 'figures'. The Bass player has his his part written as does the melody which is either sung and/or played on an instrument. So I agree with the other response but would only add....

If  other instruments play from the sheet, they would use parameters set by the composer or leader and work either use conventions of the day to double the melody, or harmonize the melody with a separate line they would improvise according to convention. Just as Jazz musicians do in groups that still actually improvise as they play. 

But, back in the day of my schooling, there was little mention of anyone but the keyboard improvising. In multiple melodic instrumental concertos, the melodic parts were of course written out. I am not aware of there being groups comparable to the Dixieland concept of polyphonic improvisation. 

If one would want to explore what they would have done if figured bass were to be played with modern instruments, which I think would be a good theory project, look to Dixieland Jazz. 

Here we have the figured bass being realized just as in the the Baroque. The Bass, piano and drums (maybe there were tambourine players in Bach's day) would be pretty much like figured bass of Bach except that the Alphabets are used instead of the numbers above the bass. The Bass reads from the Alphabet of the chord name and the number with the alphabets give the extensions and other information. 
In a four man group, the soloist is the same. Read the melody and add embellishments as they did back then. In Dixieland that would be the Trumpet traditionally and is the standard lead instrument of the early Jazz bands. 

When you add the obbligato, it was either the violin in early Dixie and then the Clarinet. They basically improvise an obbligato line weaving around the melody and expanding the tessitura of the group. 

The Trombone adds an instrumental bottom line between the Bass and the rest of the group. This line is more melodic than the Trad bass as it combines the function of the bass and a counter melody to the Trumpet as well as filling in the key harmonic notes to bring the ensemble together and add a rhythmic counter feel on the bottom as opposed to the more regular pulse of the bass. 

So you would have a baroque type of group with the rhythm section and the horn section would have full harmony from a contrapuntal standpoint and together they produced what was called Dixieland. 

IF (and this is speculation, which I like as it forces us to think out of the box) the Baroque musicians would have used group improvisation, only the parameters would change to fit the Baroque genre. If the discussion in class is getting boring, try doing it with the dixieland concept. A second line would certainly liven up the lesson and you would be learning about the concept of realizing a figured bass by actually doing it.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-12-11 23:23:47 Hysteria-LX<br>So I have spent the last month researching this exact subject! I have been reading every bit of info I could find on Fugue subjects, and analyzing more than I'd like to admit. Before I continue, I highly recommend buying a used copy of [Counterpoint in the Style of J. S. Bach](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0028702808) and read the first chapter, the chapter on inventions, and the chapter on fugue subjects, answers, and C.M.s

Anyhow, I'll share a couple of the most important things I found (Disclaimer: this is my own research, take this merely as an opinion)

1) Rhythmically, anything goes. You'll find just as many rhythmic patterns that attempt to build up motion (going from long notes to short notes), as you'll find subjects that are the opposite, or have almost no rhythmic variety.

2) Rhythmically varied subjects will often have the simplest implied harmonies. Rhythmically steady subjects will often be the most chromatic (secondary dominants). This appears to come down to tension.

3) The counter motive is pretty much always *counter* to the main subject in rhythm, note values, etc. The interplay of two very different, yet complimentary lines is what makes the fugue so fun. Also, it is nearly always invertible. 

4) Fugue subjects of the baroque era largely use non harmonic tones in the most "textbook" (our textbooks today I mean, because they are written based off this old music) way. Nearly always prepared/resolved as expected, nearly always on an off beat, etc. Obviously there are a lot of exceptions to this rule, but you'll be amazed at how easy it makes analyzing subjects.

4.5) This means most subjects are just outlining the harmonic formulae, but ornamented with smooth use of non harmonic tones.

5) The majority of subjects in the baroque area follow simple harmonic formulae. I V I. I IV V I. I ii6 IV V I, etc etc.

6) The implied high and low notes of a melody are nearly always going to be the dominant, the tonic, or the mediant. These will often have some sort of ornamentation that goes seems to break this (very often a neighbor note), but if you simplify and remove these obvious ornamentations, you will find it is nearly always one of those.

7) Tendency tones nearly always follow their... tendency!

8) Most subjects start on the tonic or dominant, and end on the mediant, tonic, or dominant, sometimes the 7th, rarely the 2nd, 4th, or 6th.

**Finally: the most important thing I learned**

9) Even the greatest Fugue subjects played alone often sound... meh.  And this is one thing I fought for so long. You can turn just about any melody that outlines I V I into an absolutely gorgeous fugue. Nobody is going to sing the subject from Bach's Fugue #6 from WTC book 1, and yet it turns into one of my absolute favorite fugues merely through it's use and development. Hell, Vincent Lo turned the [Nokia Ringtone into a Fugue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1isQlg6VGU) (yes, I know the nokia ringtone is based off a valse by Francisco Tarrega).

So uhh... good luck! I write at least one new melody every single day as practice. 99% of them suck, but I get better every day. You should do the same :)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-12-16 03:19:28 discountwilderbeast<br>I used to take lead sheets and score for jazz band for fun: 2 Altos, 2 Tenors, Baritone, 4 Trumpets, 4 Trombones, and rhythm. 

You can treat each section as its own instrument that way plus you can play around with timbre (for instance, Glenn Miller would give a Tenor the melody, double the melody an octave above on Clarinet, and the fill in the rest of the chord). 

Alternatively, you could write for a wind ensemble, basically an orchestra sans strings plus saxophones. 

If you are trying to write a symphonic piece, you have lots more to consider. The hardest thing for me starting out is learning the ranges of all the instruments are their capabilities (don't score a low A natural for an alto or tenor sax unless you want them to put their foot in the bell). 

What I would do is get your melody, get your chords, and frame your music. Sketch out some introductory material, that sort of thing. You're also going to have to decide how to score your chords: spread voicing, cluster voicing, unison passages, and all that as well.

If I was writing a piece for jazz band, I would say: 

Alright, so I want a 16 bar introduction, saxes get the four bars backed by trumpet punches, then the trombones and the low saxes and trombones get the next 8, backed by a simple trumpet counter melody, and the final four bars of the intro are a concerted passage but trumpet 2 will lay out because the first verse is a solo for him.  

Then you'd go on to chords for those passages, ect. 

You can start with something as simple as a brass quintet or string quartet or even a choir, though.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-12-24 08:23:26 frajen<br>There doesn't need to be a 13.

It kind of explains it in the Wiki:

&gt; the combination of functional and non-functional chords provides cohesiveness while producing a free and shifting tonal center

Basically, changing tonal centers (relatively) quickly produces a tense but resolved feeling that many people nowadays would consider to be "jazzy" - or maybe awkward/jumpy at worst.

Playing in F major and then having to switch into Ab major causes a soloist to adjust the melody accordingly. I think there are a bunch of jazz standards which show how this "tonal center switching" idea grew

[Miles Davis "Tune Up"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiSDqJIQk8k)

http://www.guitarcats.com/realbook-jazz-standards/tune-up

ii-V-I in D, ii-V-I in C, ii-V-I in Bb, Eb, ii-V in D, Bb, ii-V in D again

Taken in a different light. Maybe we think of that progression as: Dmaj7 x4  | Cmaj7 x4 | Bbmaj7 x3 | Ebmaj7 | Dmaj7 x2 | Bbmaj7 | Dmaj7

[John Coltrane "Moment's Notice"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gocGlRuW1bw)

http://www.guitarcats.com/images/JazzStandardCharts/MOMENT'S%20NOTICE-299.jpg

ii-V in D, ii-V-I in Eb, ii-V in Gb, ii-V in C, ii-V-I in Db, ii-V-i in C(m7), ii-V-I in Ab, ii-V in Gb, ii-V in F, ii-V-I in Gb, etc.

We could also view this as:

D | Eb | Gb | C | Db | Cm | Ab | Gb | F | Gb

And there's always [Giant Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30FTr6G53VU) which skips the ii a bunch in favor of V-I progressions

My point is that in jazz, changing tonal centers is common, and using constant structures can be a hip way to switch. The major 7th structure is arguably the most "obvious" way to switch tonality, and the contrast arguably creates more tension as the chord progression moves forward.

As a counter example, if you played Dm7-Am7-Em7 &lt;- well you could be entirely in C major for that. Of course, some structures like Fm7-Dm7-Bbm7-Gm7 are a little bit more interesting... YMMV

a lil intro, [On Green Dolphin St.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wwxaJ80nCg)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-03 10:23:52 torchflame<br>Are you talking about in 4 part harmony, pop, jazz, gospel? Typically you want to write a bass line as you normally would: some sort of counter melody 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-08 00:01:49 discountwilderbeast<br>In the context of say a big band or an orchestra, the melody line is simply more prominent. A tenor saxophone may play the melody of a song while the trumpet section plays a counter melody. The tenor sax plays an octave below the trumpets, but it's still the melody. 

As far as the piano is concerned, you can bury the melody in chords. Jelly Roll Morton used to play the melody with his right thumb while harmonizing above it with the rest of his hand. In country piano it's common place a note above and below the melody. In [Last Date by Floyd Cramer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m34m6-YhjAc) you hear this device plus lots of "slip notes," grace notes that are more than a half step from the melody note. 

It's really a matter of preference. This [Oscar Peterson on *The Dick Cavett Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec-FrnaU0rs) clip is very interesting and at one point addresses your question. You can put the melody wherever you like. I've also found it interesting to throw the melody into the bass range, played by the left hard, while embellishing with the right hand, sort of like a bass solo would work in a barbershop quartet. You don't want to bury the melody too much. It's possible but difficult to play the melody note louder with the finger playing the melody, which is probably why Morton used his thumb, so you really just want to strike a balance. Thalberg played in what could be characterized as a ["three-handed style."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebG_Fl23JsM). He was beloved for a while until audiences grew tired of his style, calling him "Old Arpeggio." He played the melody with both thumbs, a bass line, and a rapid, [Art Tatum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu7UP4wdn7I) esque runs in the right hand, even though he predated Tatum by almost a century. The melody was still audible. It all comes down to what you want to sound like. 

Basically, as a general rule, the melody is the highest note being played because it's easier to hear the note. In barbershop quartets though, the tenor sings harmony above the lead while the bass sings the root of the chord or the lowest note in the inversion, and the baritone fills in the gaps. Some styles are built around placing the melody under the other notes, but **the melody is always discernable**. I think that's the key.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-09 06:31:32 Bigfrostynugs<br>You would call that a counter melody. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-09 07:58:16 ljse7m<br>Well, they are whatever you make them to be! You are describing a pretty typical orchestral composition. The only difference is that you are using a different groupings of instruments than a standard symphony orchestra. 

*you could just as easily have a solo vocal singing a melody, another group is the 4 piece sax section

*then you add a counter melody with trumpet 

*So if they all are written to be able to be played together your harmony would be a common factor in all the groups. 

*Since they are all melodies and compatible accompaniment groups or solos, they would all be capable of standing alone or playing together. 

*you could score them all together at the same time or you could stagger their parts to make it a linear progression and you could even have each section enter as a round or you could actually play the entire set of sections as a round and build up the texture from 

*one solo voice to two solo voices to the adding of one of the accompaniments and then to the whole kit and kabootle. 

* your length of the melodies and harmonic accompaniments would be of the same length if they were to be able to be played simultaneously. 

*I don't know of a unique name for what you are saying, but I think that the thinking of each "musical section" as a unique entity that are written to be compatible with each other and that allows you to think of them as groups of instruments just as a symphonic composition is a combination the woodwind section, the string section, the brass, the percussion and other assorted instruments. you are just using a different process of exposition as you roll out the various sections. 

If this doesn't help you out, it should help us find a better way of communicating. So let me know if i am understanding you better now and if this answered or created more questions.

What i was thinking of,  i believe was definitely in the realm of homophony. A single dominant melody accompanied by a few lesser counter-melodies and harmony, if that sounds correct. I had no clue whatsover of the bigger picture untill you explained a bit of texture. It adds a piece of puzzle in. i really need to study up more on texture, counterpoint and form for sure. I've spent a lot of time on chord function and not much else i guess....lotsa to learna
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-11 22:00:24 jesucont01<br>Context is everything.  I know it sounds vague, but all the best known melodies became known because of the context they written for, like Happy Birthday or We wish a Merry Christmas.  

Structurally, most melodies do follow a form, of which you can practice writing some in.  A1-A2-A3-B is one example. This isn't in reference to the actual form of the song, but the groupings of the melody.  For example, the opening of Let It Go: http://imgur.com/2oQprJc
The first three bars have the same grouping, with a variant in the third bar. The fourth bar is the "B" of the melodic structure which I have found works not so much as a cadence, but an end point or counter to the preceding bars.  

This theory on melodies you won't find online or in book, unless someone has beaten me to it.  It is something that I started developing when I was teaching composition at a local university.  It came out of many years of finding that chord theory and the rest was coming up short in explaining why do melodies work.  It also never made sense why Beethoven would spend so much time crafting his themes instead of writing chord progressions.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-20 10:42:25 Salemosophy<br>I think it's a pretty good write-up. Here are some points I would make as addendums:

Don't think of writing separate "melodies;" instead, think about "voices" that will literally sing the line you've given them. Not all lines are written to be melodies. It may be that trying to make a melody out of an inner voice is counter-intuitive to holding a common tone over several bars. So, think about it from a perspective of "voice" as opposed to "melody." 

I think it's useful to talk about where to go after grasping the basics of counterpoint and fugues, which was something that took me a bit of trial and error to start developing in my writing. Once you begin taking a melody and harmonizing it, things start to become "complicated." Once you're finished creating basic contrapuntal lines in each species, your next step is to begin analyzing for implied harmonic function, which takes a bit of work to  master without a good mental framework. 

There are a few tricks I might add for "quick counterpoint" in voicing large harmonic textures. For example, melodic content typically highlights the "colorful" tones of the harmony (3rds, suspended 4ths, 7ths, 9ths, etc.), so where possible, try to incorporate these tones into the melody. Similarly, the bass and tenor voices enjoy root and fifth a lot. The trouble, sometimes, is that we end up in situations of parallel octaves or fifths. My solution is to alternate between a doubled root and a root/fifth pairing between bass and tenor voices when presented with parallel fifths/octaves. This way, you're not necessarily forced to move the tenor to the third (and move the melody away from the third, because you're only supposed to double the third if your chord is in first inversion) when it can easily shift between the role of doubling the bass and harmonizing it a fifth above. Other tricks include:

* Moving at least one voice in a different direction than the other voices
* Moving at least one voice by a different series of intervals (for example, skips or steps depending on what the other voices AREN'T doing)
* Maintaining one or more common tones across several chords  while at the same time shifting these common tones across two or more voices throughout a passage (so that no one voice is singing the same tone for an entire passage)
* Counter-melodies can often present themselves in the inner voices, so don't ignore your altos or tenors. 
* Strong melodies and counter-melodies are often characterized by the presence of what we might consider strong (or stable) intervals like perfect 4ths, 5ths, and so on. This doesn't rule out other intervals, of course, but if you're writing your first counter-melody and you're not sure how to begin, give this tip a try. 

And if I could think of anything else to add to this list I would, but for now, this will have to suffice. It's a good write up... just wanted to throw in my two cents as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-02-29 23:14:19 tcspears<br>I looked on Wikipedia for One Day More, and it is described as Quodlibet:

"It is composed in the key of A major and is set to the tempo of Moderato at 86 bpm. One Day More is a choral piece featuring many solos from the main characters of the stage show, all of whom sing in a counterpoint style known as dramatic quodlibet, featuring parts by the ensemble. The song borrows motifs and themes from several songs from the first act.

Each character sings his/her part to a different melody at the same time (counterpoint), before joining for the final chorus:

Valjean picks up the melody of "Who Am I?" without any changes (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
Marius, Cosette and Éponine sing to the melody of "I Dreamed a Dream" with Éponine's taking the bridge ("But the tigers come at night", sung by Éponine as "One more day all on my own") (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs, modulating to F# minor, G minor for high toned TVs)
Enjolras repeats the bridge melody of "I Dreamed a Dream" but in a major key, with Marius singing a minor countermelody. (C major, Db major for high toned TVs)
Javert sings to the already often-used theme from "Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven" or "Fantine's Arrest", only slower and in a major key. (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
The Thénardiers sing to a slightly changed melody from "Master of the House" (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
The revolutionaries repeat the bridge melody of "I Dreamed a Dream" in a major key with a counter melody that is only instrumental in Fantine's solo. (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
At the end of the song, everyone sings the melody of "Who Am I?" (C major)"

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-03-09 09:15:33 NRMusicProject<br>Bear with me here, as I'm really tired and can't exactly organize my thoughts fluidly today.

So, the program was right with a caveat: There are omitted notes which are implied.

First of all, let's talk key: While C# is "technically" correct (the best kind of correct), it's easier to say Db.  The particular chart of the circle of 5ths left out C#, which is the same as Db.  Most of the time, computers on think in sharp keys, which isn't always the best way to work.  Indeed, the minute I heard the tune, I immediately thought Db, not C#.  Why is this better?  Db major has five flats, whereas C# has seven sharps--it is a mess for the reader.  The computer actually further confuses you by throwing the Fm chord in there...in the key of C#, the chord should technically be an E#m.  And this is why it's needlessly complicated a key.

As for chord qualities, C#7 is NOT C#Major.  It's C#*dominant*.  That's a major triad with a minor 7th stacked on top.  C#M7 is a major triad with a *major* 7th on top.

So the first two chords have a descending 7th that resolves to a 3rd.  It's a very simple but powerful moving line that one could have used for a counter melody (the notes in the moving line that you hear are C-B-Bb-A, etc.  It's a descending chromatic scale).

So, you have the tonic chord, which becomes a dominant, or the V chord of IV.  Another simple, yet powerful movement.

Also, as I mentioned, since it's easier to think in Db, retyping your chords would look like this:

Dbmaj7 | Db7 | Gb | Ebdim/Gb | Fm7 | Bb7 (no3) | Eb7 (no3) | Gb(6)9/Ab

This makes things a bit easier to grasp.  

But let's look at a few more issues:

Ebdim/Gb is a problem, since the 5th was omitted.  I'm more inclined to say that it was Gbmin...the Db is still very strongly implied there.

With the omitted thirds, without a stringent listening, I do hear them.  They are probably there, or in the voice, or strongly implied.  That last chord id definitely an AbMaj, NOT Gb.

So here's the progression as I hear it:

Dbmaj7 | Db7 | Gb | Gbm | Fm7 | Bbm7 | Ebm7 | Ab7

...or...

I7 | V7/IV | IV | iv | iii | vi | ii | V7

Edit: fixed continuity of chord qualities.

Edit: The Sequel: The changes sounded a bit familiar, and while it's not exact, [this tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGFToiLtXro) is probably the one I was reminded of.  The changes aren't Identical, but here they are:

I | I7 | V7/IV | IV | iv | I | V7/4-3 | I 

Measures 2-5 are identical to measures 1-4 in Bae.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-03-30 23:56:12 TRexRoboParty<br>Look into counterpoint - it deals with writing several intertwining melodies within a harmonic framework. Great melody almost always beats great harmony, if you only had to use one.

Personally, I find it easier and more natural to write from a harmony perspective but I tend to get better results by just forcing myself to write 3 melodies: a bass part, a lead part and a counter melody. The harmony "emerges" from the relationships between those. Try and make each part melodic in its own right. 

Also, if you have a strong melody you can get away with all sorts of cool/weird harmonic ideas. If you have cool/weird harmonic ideas, it's much harder to write a strong melody that doesn't sound like its contorting itself to the changes.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-04-13 20:21:53 Low_Pan<br>Try writing a two voice  invention, it's one of the easiest contrapuntal techniques for beginners.  Set the Chester melody as your top voice, and compose a counter melody to go under it.  Thirds, sixths, fifths, and octaves are your friends.  Fourths, seconds and sevenths are not.  PM if you need help.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-04-14 02:59:49 Low_Pan<br>The short answer is yes, but the number one rule is just to make it sound good.  After that, you're going to want to choose notes that will create harmonic (chord) movement.  

The first step is analyze Chester and figure out all the chords.  This is because you're going to want to use the notes in the chords to create your counter melody.  Once you know the progression you'll know which notes to choose from for each chord.  When the chord changes you use a different set of notes.

Use mostly chord tones for the counter melody and you'll be fine.  Pay attention to the intervals between the notes in your melody and counter melody though.  Like I said before octaves, fifths, thirds and sixths are your friends.  They are consonant intervals (sound good) and will give you the most obvious harmonic movement.  You'll want these notes to fall on the beat. 

The other intervals are dissonant and will give you cool sounds, but you want to use them sparingly.  Try using them in between beats as passing tones when you are moving from one chord tone to another.

Now for the counterpointy bit:     Let's say your melody is in the key of C major and has a B note moving to a C note at the end of a phrase.  To me, that leading tone to tonic motion would suggest a V-I cadence.  Your counter melody notes could then be G moving to a C to imply those chords.  (G major is G-B-D, C Major is C-E-G)  I say that they are implied chords because there is no third voice to make up the full triad.

Try putting the root note or fifth of each chord on the first beat of each measure to start out.  Do the whole song like this.  At this point you'll start to really hear the chord movement and will get a better sense of what it will sound like.  Once you have that, add another note to each measure (making the counter melody all half notes).  Then add more notes until you're satisfied.  You don't have to do a direct 1:1 note ratio against the two lines, that will be really fucking hard.  Get the half notes in, and then fill it in a bit and you should be good to go.       

Remember, just make it sound good.  Hope this helps.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-04-26 00:10:40 ljse7m<br>OK, Now the Part 2 of the explanation. 

Now that is the first context. of the fourth and fifth ambiguity. The fourth is consonant inside the matrix of the Overtone series. The fourth occurs between the 4th and the 5th element. And there it is consonant. This is the starting point. In reference to the Overtone series of a single sound, the Fourth is consonance. 

Now when more resonance was wanted, the musicians started to move to elementary counter point by (for some subliminal reason?) started to double the melody in what was called "organum" 

So lets look at this context by starting with the simple Parallel movement of voices singing the Cantus Firmus with the melody as the "root" then the 5th stacked above that and then doubled at the octave. Here we have a segment of the vertical structure of the Overtone series. I will refer to it as the Harmonic Series as now we are singing harmony. One can assume that they chose this structure because it was convenient and rather easy as it is very sonorous and it fits the basic ranges of the male voices. Why does it sound so sonorous? Well, it just happens to be the 2nd, 3rd and 4th elements of the Harmonic series! (Coincidence?) BUT for what ever reason, they tried it and they liked it. (I doubt that they ever considered the Harmonic Series but they still chose it because it worked)

So in this context, the C and the G 5th is consonant and the G to C 5th is consonant as it is part of the structure and together the three sounds are consonant to the implied Fundamental of the harmonic series. The "root" of the structure is in PERFECT consonance with the implied Fundamental. (remember the Prime and Octave) As this structure runs parallel to the Cantus Firmus, this implied Fundamental changes to the melody note. The C.F. melody note itself is the 

But what happens if you  start with a slightly less Perfect Consonance in the structure 

Lets remove the top voice and just look at the "root" C and the 5th G. Here we have what has already been established as a Perfect consonant if it is in the context of the Harmonic Series as both notes are consonant with the Implied Fundamental. As we move around on the C.F. this vertical structure moves with it and we have consonance as the C.F. No problem 

What happens if we remove the 5th from the structure? We drop the lower voice and for example and we use the 3rd and 4th element of the Harmonic series? Its still a segment of the Harmonic series, but the bottom note is NOT in the PERFECT consonance of the Prime and Octave. We now have a new Harmonic Series created by the G note. Since it is the lowest real note in the structure it creates its own Harmonic Series starting on G. Now the C above the G in the Organum is NOT compatible with the harmonic series of G. The G harmonic series is G G D G so that REAL note of C which was compatible with the implied Fundamental of C is is now  NOT compatible with the expected note of D in the new harmonic series of G. 

And that is the next ambiguity of conflicting contexts. The C---&gt;G  in real notes are consonant because they are in accord with the (subliminal) tones of the Harmonic Series but the G--&gt; C fourth is not compatible with the REAL notes because it is in conflict with the new (implied) Harmonic series of the real Bass note that we actually hear. 

This is the second part of the answer. We still have not talked about the non parallel counterpoint that is to come. AND this is where Fux comes into the picture. His thesis was written I believe in the Baroque period or there abouts and it a thesis on explaining how the musicians used these two ambiguous contexts of the fourth and the fifth as they found ways to account for this conflict of the real notes that they sang and heard and and the implied notes that they probably did not even realize existed in an academic state but certainly could feel that their was some reason that the fourth was consonant in one context but was not consonant in another. I do not know exactly when the overtone series was actually discovered and explained by scientists, and I would appreciate anyone that knows when it came to be known would share that information with me. I am only explaining how it affected and shaped the consonance of early music by the music that they wrote and found to be working and coincidentally  just happens to conform with the physics that was probably not even part of their philosophy. But if they knew it or not, and if we accept it or not, the Overtone series is present in all the music that we hear and produce at least by natural means. When a choir sings a cappella especially in the early music, they will instinctively revert to the intonation of the harmonic series. There is a reason for that and that is because it sounds good and it sounds good because it is in sync with the implied overtone series that guided the composers of the music. Its just a matter of physics. In future installments, as we move up to the next level of counterpoint, we will move up the harmonic series as we see how they "coincide" with the evolution of our consonance and dissonance of the early polyphonic music. At present, in my discourse, we are only using the first  elements of the harmonic series. C C G C and how they react to a real vs implied tones as we build our harmonic structure. When we add the 5th element, the third, we get into the lesser consonant tones or less perfect harmonic tones of the major third and minor 6ths as we are then getting into the tones of C C G C E and this is where it gets interesting. 

If you look at the early music as defined by Fux you will see that the early two part counterpoint has only the perfect consonants. Fux (if I remember the order he uses accurately) starts to explain the consonance and dissonance and the resolution rules that governed the beginnings of real independent movement of voices as they interact with each other. Up to now, what I have discussed is all consonant. Parallel but consonant. There is no tension or relaxation except for melodic tension but there is no interaction of voices so far, only parallel motion of a consonant C G C structure. If there are examples of music written in two part C G structures, I am not familiar with them. If anyone has some early examples of that, I would be interested but I do suspect that on some days the bass voice had to cough or stopped singing for some reason, but I don't know of any instances of where the upper structure of parallel 4th have existed. 

With the addition of more than two voices, when the C.F. may be in the middle of the structure and in two part when the C.F. is in the upper voice, that is where the real confusion  or clarification of the ambiguity of the O.P.'s question is explained more directly. These first two parts are only setting up the contexts that is necessary to understand WHY the 4th is both consonant and dissonant depending upon the context. For some, this is all that is needed to understand the reason, but when two independent parts are combined to produce the harmony of the early music, that introduces a third context of Consonance and dissonance and how this tension adds another context to the music. Now, however, the first two underlying contextual ambiguity issues should serve as a preparation for understanding why the perfect fourth can be both consonant and dissonant depending upon the context. 

 Thank you for your patience! (lol) I hope that this second part begins to clarify the preparation of the first part!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-05-04 14:48:00 K_Rayfish<br>Mechanical voicings are the bread and butter of big band writing. To put it simply, the mechanical voicings are voicings constructed from the top down, following specific rules. The top voice is usually just the melody, which is great for soli sections or general use. But if your melody is elsewhere, you'll have to write the top line yourself. A counter-melody or a guide tone line (line made mostly of 3rds and 7ths of chords, with smooth voice leading) both work well. Here's how these voicings work:

"4-way close" is the most basic voicing. Let's say the chord is Bbmaj7 and D is the top note. From the top down, the voicing would be D, Bb, A, F: each successive lower voice is just the closest chord tone from the one above. You can also substitute chord tones with a close tension that is available for the chord- the root can be replaced by the 9, and the fifth can be replaced by the 11 or the 13 (keep the 3rd and the 7th in the voicing though). So for our example, we could instead have D, C, A, F; D, Bb, A, G; or D, C, A, G. This gives a richer sound, and it'll be necessary for other rules of the voicing. The note in the lead might be a tension as well; in this case you'll leave out whatever note the tension replaces. So, for a Bbmaj7 with C in the lead, we'd have C, A, F, D, with C replacing the Bb.

When you're moving between chords, you want to make sure that no voice repeats a note or moves in contrary motion. To do this, use the tension substitution method above. You might have to backtrack and adjust earlier voicings to avoid this-it's kind of a trial and error process. You should also avoid having a half step at the top of the voicing. This pretty much only happens for maj7 chords with the root on top. In that case, replace the 7 with the 6.

Especially when working with a melody as the top voice, you'll have to decide which notes are part of the chord, and which are passing tones. If a note is a passing tone, skip it at first and harmonize the chord tone that it's leading to (this will be the "target chord"). Then, you have a couple options for harmonizing the passing tone without any repeated notes. You can transpose the voicing of the target chord diatonically or chromatically relative to the lead. This is the go-to option. If that doesn't work (because of repeated notes), harmonize the passing tone with the secondary dominant (b9) chord of the target chord. If that still won't work, you'll have to adjust some of the earlier voicings and try again.

There are also some other mechanical voicings, but they're all just variations of 4-way close. For "drop 2", take the second voice (from the top) down the octave. "Drop 3" takes the 3rd voice down the octave. Lastly, "drop 2+4" takes the 2nd and bottom voices down the octave. And if you ever want to use five voices instead of 4, just double the top note at the octave below. Choose between these voicings based on the range of the melody. A low melody works well with 4-way close, because the other voicings might go below the range of an instrument playing. Parts for the 4 trumpets usually use 4-way close too, so that all of the trumpets can stay in a bright high register. High melodies sound great with drop 2, drop 3, or drop 2+4, because it gives you a great open sound. These sound especially good for 4 or 5 saxes, because the bari will be playing in its awesome low register. Don't change voicings in the middle of a line, though- only change when the melody has rests (if necessary) or for different sections.

Finally- how can we actually use this for big band writing? Usually, you'll split up the band into 3 sections: trumpets, trombones, and saxes. One of these groups will have the melody, which can be be unison, harmonized with mechanical voicings, or played by a soloist. The other two groups will have backgrounds, made up of hits, countermelodies, and/or guide tone lines. You could have both groups play, or just one. If you do use both, they'll probably play the same parts, but always use different voicings for the two groups! (Using the same voicing sounds lame and usually leads to one group covering another one up.) So, in a typical situation, you might have trumpets playing the melody in 4-way close, with drop 2-4 saxes and 4-way close trombones playing backgrounds.

Hopefully this super long post helps! Let me know if you have any questions. And also this isn't the only way the write for big band, but it instantly gives that big band sound, and it's basically foolproof. Most arrangements with at least 4 horns use this technique for at least part of the melody.

**TL;DR** Stack chord tones from the melody note down, avoiding repeated notes between voicings by substituting tensions for chord tones.

I agree with the need for varying, i just did not know where to go with it, take it i only started this piece 4 days ago, so for that span of time, it is definitely getting there. I was thinking maybe inverting the melodies, because that very hidden Trombone counter melody could help very it since it is not very noticeable right now.

I took the theme and took out the trumpets at the end, and put the trombone center stage, i gave it a counter melody to the harp part, then it lead into the theme. it's still the same theme, but like you said i focused on a certain part and furthered it. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-05-27 06:02:49 PattyPooner<br>Its just a "disgression" thing. I'm working on a song that utilizes natural minor for the verse, and harmonic for the chorus. A general rule for when to sharp the 6th or 7th rather than leaving the tones in the "natural" scale is when ascending. As a counter rule then, the natural 6th and 7th( or minor 6th and 7th's) would mostly be used when descending the melody. 

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-06-02 17:09:15 jonpv<br>&gt; NES inspired game

If it's not actually running on the NES, does it need to be 100% authentic? You could bend the rules a little bit?

I've never used a NES and have no idea what it was like. But I've listened to some of the music on YouTube and it seems like they have this:

- Bassline
- Main melody, played with one note, or two notes playing the same rhythm at different intervals (adding in a harmony)
- Or instead of one main melody, two melodies which complement each other (main melody with counter melody)
- Lots of very fast arpeggios instead of chords, thrown in very often at the beginning / end of phrases, or where the melody pauses
- Lots of pitch modulation (vibrato) or pitch slides (glissando / portamento, or the pitch just changing through the note)
- Drums &amp; percussion

So basically come up with some cool melodies, either with harmonies or counter melodies, write a bass line, throw in loads of fast arpeggios here and there, mod the pitch in a cool way, add the drums, and put in lots of effort into making sure there's lots of variation and the music feels like it has motion and excitement.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-06-11 21:13:54 ljse7m<br>Well, each element is actually quite simple. When you break it down into the basic concepts, complexity develops in how things interact, that is when the complexity starts to be perceived! Counterpoint is a good example. 

In the evolutionary process one started with a really simple Cantus Firmus. A simple melody often not unlike the Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. Then you add the second voice. A simple counter melody that has really only two elements, consonance and dissonance. If it is consonant, go someplace new and see if that is consonant or dissonant. If that place is dissonant, move to a consonant place. That is really simple. 

Then you put the third voice in and the same rules apply but then you have three things to juggle! Add a fourth simple voice and then you have 5! All very simple melodies when taken separately  but when combined, they have to be in perfect balance. The key is to keep things simple and learn to listen to what you have and forget about the complexity of the combination but to be able to see how things interact and simplify what you thought was already simple just a bit more until that mobile comes into balance. You started with a simple balance scale, and then you keep adding them and you have to find that new balance point on each element to keep the whole thing in a proper relationship with the others hanging from that first simple balance scale. 

The key is learning to learn to listen to what you have and to see what is causing the balance to shift and then only fix what is necessary to keep the entire structure in balance. 

When all the scales settle into balance your mobile is finished. The key is to learn to listen to how things sound and make those small adjustments. I find that ones subconscious is more objective than our conscious mind so learning to let the SC do its work and to listen to what it is telling us is the key to keeping a thread of sanity when working on any artistic project. 

Have fun. I like how that analysis isolates some of the concepts into  more digestible bites and remember that in the case of a ballet like this, the ballet is a meal and each concept is one course that is blended with the other courses to form the entire meal. Everything is not always happening at the same time and some courses are more complicated than others but when you break it down, a great meal is really only a combination of simple "sliders" selected to give a perfect balance of several simple elements arranged in the proper order to give a balanced meal. 

Bon appétit.

It seems to consistent entirely of F, C and Dm harmonies, with that insistent F-E-F-E etc motif over it all.  There's a kind of hint it could head for D minor at some point - perhaps because it's unusual to have so much emphasis melodically on a tonic note.  It's a nice sounding piece as it is, IMO, would make nice incidental music, or even a theme, for a film or TV drama - there's a sense of indefinable tension gently building, because that repeated motif just hangs on in there while the harmonies change and cycle.  Personally I'd like to hear a counter melody in the violin or cello, long notes against that piano motif - there are hints of one in there, it just needs to come out more: more long notes, maybe just try random notes from the F major scale, see how they sound.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-06-21 15:36:23 BonaparteZ<br>I usually decide on "guide scales" and the progression first, purely on paper. Then I listen to it and make some modifications if necessary. Only as the next step, I'll let my inner ear come up with a melody that fits into that environment. If "two steps forward, one step back" is your melody, that same melody will take on a very different meaning if your environment is a cliff vs an open meadow, so that's why I prefer that method of setting the environment first. Whenever I go with melody first, I tend to build a counter-melody and let the chords be accidental. Of course, those are only my personal preferences. A very decent idea, I find, is to use a different approach for each sub-section of the song.

Overall, I don't think you should be thinking in terms of rules to follow, but more in terms of options to explore. Contrary to popular belief, studying theory will enhance your creative freedom and not restrict it. Only if you want your song to fit into a certain genre, then there will be genre specific rules to follow.

Edit: Oh. As to how people choose the chord progressions: After a while, you'll just know from experience how to achieve certain moods. You could just study some of the theory that artists you like use in their songs, collect all the things you've learned about that way in your very own bag of tricks, then recombine them to your likings.

Listen to how they take a simple motive in the bass and develop it.

Take what they started with, see how they ended it/modified it as a transition.

Listen to Geezer butler and how he uses pentatonic motion as more of a counter melody rather than base line.

Take all the elements these musicians use and try to reverse engineer them to a formula. (I know "it's not music anymore") 

But this process of intense study to simplify and internalize the elements of great bass playing is how you'll literally shit out an interesting bass line intuitively.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-07-26 16:40:35 dynam0<br>Some good answers so far, but I just wanted to chime in a bit more.  Let's assume a basic, straightforward sonata for the first movement. 

So we've got the exposition--probably starts with violin I with the melody, violin II and viola harmonizing/counter melody and cello outlining the bass.  Somewhere in the exposition is usually a modulation, and the main theme probably gets passed off to say violin II and then comes back to violin I to end the exposition.

A pretty typical development setup might be to have the cello get some action--main theme hanging in the minor area maybe--while the violins outline the chords. Viola could get in on the theme development, and the theme probably gets passed around multiple times. Cello probably gets called upon to emphasize key/chord changes, violins probably have a bit more to do with the melody changing. 

Recap--back to violin I and everyone else mostly playing a supporting role.



So right away you can see that there are some really clearly defined rules, and could even be described as a bit boring. Like it's pretty intuitive once you've listened to a couple. And that's where the romantics really went wild, along with basically everything else.

I'd agree with the other poster who said just listen to a couple on like YouTube or something and I think you'll figure it out. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-07-26 18:02:32 xiipaoc<br>&gt; it seems like you would either do four voice counterpoint or have the first violin play the melody and the rest act as harmonic accompanyment

But that would be *boring*!  Why would they do that?  I mean, yes, Mozart was boring as all hell, but not *that* boring.  Remember the Classical period was a (fairly) long time ago, but people weren't actually stupid back then.  (Well, maybe some were, but whatever.)  There's no reason to be so limited.

The best way to think about a quartet, in my opinion, is as a large ensemble, not a small one.  You can write basically orchestral music, so long as it fits in those four voices.  The four players don't have assigned roles, like the basso continuo did in the Baroque period; there's no reason to do that.  You can easily fit a melody, a countermelody, and accompaniment into those four voices, and if you look, that's pretty much what they did.  They didn't do full four-voice counterpoint because that was not a texture they were particularly interested in developing, but they did plenty of two-voice counterpoint with accompaniment, for example.  And you can do even more.  You can take the essence of imitative counterpoint -- different voices playing the same thing -- and take out the actual counterpoint.  Just state a theme in the second violin, restate it in the viola while the second violin goes back to playing eighth notes or something, then restate it in the first violin, and finally in the cello.  Or you could have some other scheme.  In that era, composers were quite fond of actually giving the first violin all the good parts.  I try to never do something that crazy when I write music; I write for a cappella, and if I have SATB with no solo, that melody gets fucking *shared*.  Not yours, sopranos!  DEFINITELY not yours, first violins!  On the other hand, I sing tenor, so... by "shared" I mean "the tenors have it most of the time".  I didn't say I share *equitably*!

You may think of the Classical period as rigid and unimaginative, but it really wasn't so rigid.  (Ba dum tsh.  MOZART BURRRRN!)  I recommend looking at some scores and doing a motivic analysis.  At each point, figure out what each instrument is playing.  Is it just background 8th notes, the harmonic accompaniment you mentioned?  Is it a melody or counter melody?  How does that get passed from part to part?  What the fuck is that weird symbol on the viola staff, and why do the notes not make any sense?  (I still haven't figured that last one out.)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-08-27 07:26:21 setecordas<br>Here is how I break it down. I start from the very general and work my way to the particular.

Look at the key and melody, and play it through so you have a good mental and physical understanding of the music. Is there a bass part? Play through that and make a note of what's going on (especially important for transcribing music).


What notes are fall on the strong beats? These are likely the most important notes to harmonize. Any accidentals or chromaticisms? Does it seem to modulate or is staying in the same key? Make a note of that. Begin harmonizing using just I and V chords where ever possible. Can you add any pre or subdominants that make sense? Are there any notes that seem not to be in the key, or seem to be borrower from  the relative major or minor? Is there a possibility for one or more chords per beat? Is there a possibility for any chord substitutions? What can I do to make the guitar accompaniment interesting? Rhythms, counter melodies?


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-09-01 09:50:56 setecordas<br>I think the first one is best, especially with a single melodic line. In my experience, it is best to have as clean a notation as possible. The syncopation is simple enough that you won't need beaming and ties to indicate where the down beat is. That being said, it might be different if you had a counter melody below it that could cause ambiguity between the voices. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-09-02 18:18:35 CarrionComfort<br>It's fairly straightforward. 

The strings don't stand out enough to suggest counter-point. They do accent every beat while the leads plays a rhythmically varied melody. The guitars play of each other in a sort of disjointed way but it still carries the melody clearly. 

They just layered parts over each other pretty well. I think more of the major comes from the mixing that lets you hear all the parts clearly. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-09-04 03:36:09 TexasRangerNathan<br>Clever counter point and arranging are probably how we wound up with pieces like this chronologically. I would say you probably are thinking about harmony as stationary blocks that are seperate from the melody which would be considered bad part writing. You probably need to have more independences in your voices in your harmonies and the voices need to be more convincing counter melodies instead of just notes in chord. If you study big band esque arranging by listening to how the melody moves between individual instruments and what they do when they arent playing the melody you will likely be able to abstract what you found creative about the arranger/composers work and use it in your own works. Some people will tell you to look at scores but I think thats only necessary if you are concerned with the tones that make up the melody and harmony. Even without being able to instantly transcribe a piece of music you will be able to analyize its form and find arrangement tricks going on. Duke Ellington might be a good person to listen to as his career goes from early jazz and strict pop forms to some more expiremental forms later on. Not quite late Miles Davis no form madness but you should be able to pick up some tricks. Find patterns and copy them. Whenever your musics form becomes too predictable do something entirely different and your audience will be pleased you thwarted their expectations. Thats what jazz is all about so thats why I point you in that direction.

Thanks for the thanks!

One last tip. From a composing standpoint just loop your melodies and sing another melody on top of it than find the notes you were singing. Play with when you layer them and you will end up writing songs like this. Thats likely the work flow emancipator if you throw sound selection in somewhere.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-10-13 12:19:24 johnjakegerald<br>&gt;I know you don't have some instruments playing a melody while others just hold a chord -- or at least I think so. 

I guess the number and choice of instruments determines a lot, as does the style you are writing. 

For example, a vocal melody with piano accompaniment can be similar to what you are describing, except the piano usually doesn't just "hold" the chord, but uses rhythms to create motifs or riffs, or even counter melodies. 

The same would be true in a larger ensemble playing the same song, but the individual instruments would fulfill certain harmonic and rhythmic roles to contribute to the riff.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-12-04 20:40:07 Jongtr<br>&gt; Thanks. I'm not sure if I hear the chord correctly. Can you take a listen to verify?

Which chord? I did take a listen, and they all sound correct to me, but I didn't listen to part 1.

&gt;Is there any resource where I could read about non-functional voice-leading? If we count solely on voice leading and disregard key, could we make a progression that is not in any key or mode and still sounds good? Is there any music composed like this?
This is just something I've noticed in all kinds of chord moves.  It seems that the principle of "parsimonious voice-leading" is the over-riding principle, taking no account of key.  

In classical harmony, the principle when changing chords (within a key) is to retain any shared tones, and move other tones to the *nearest* note in the next chord.  (There are other rules about certain intervals to avoid, but in modern harmony we can take those with a pinch of salt.)

When modulating, or using secondary chords, the *same principles* apply.

Or course, in classical music, key is central, and chromatic harmony is always at its service.  But the principle of parsimony can (at least in theory) be applied to any chord change - if we're not concerned about tonicising a diatonic chord, or establishing a new key.  It may well be that the resulting chord sequence sounds weird, or aimless ("where's the key?") - but it will still sound *logical*, chord to chord.  Like following a path which doesn't seem to go anywhere, but it's *still a path* - it has a linear form, just no evident end point.

You could say the above tune contains an example of that, in the way it goes from Em9 to G7 to Fmaj7 to Bbmaj7.  What's that all about?  And yet there are obvious shared tones, and good voice-leading.  Likewise the "weird" change from Gm9 to B7 - no discernible key connection there; but they share the A note, and there's some nice chromatic moves too.  In fact, of course, it's like a Bb triad moving up to a B triad, made more interesting by giving both chords an A note, and adding a G to the first chord, so it can (at least in principle) descend to F# - those two voices counter the crude parallelism of the triads.

To me, those are examples of how the principle works. Here, B7 is obviously "explained" by its resolution to Em. But maybe it could go somewhere else? Why not?

However, the elephant in the room here is MELODY!  That always has to be in charge of any chord sequence.  And melody tends to make less sense if we can't perceive some kind of key or mode context.  We tend to feel lost until a tune "emerges" into a key, like a clearing in a jungle.  But a diatonic tune could still be harmonised in chromatic and non-functional ways - perhaps to be deliberately unsettling while the diatonicism of the tune stops it being random.

As an inspiration, listen to the bridge of George Harrison's "Only a Northern Song", where he sings "it doesn't really matter what chords I play", and ask what makes it hang together (he was too good a musician to take his lyric at face value).  Lennon, too - in that period - liked to play with chord changes intended to have a "wtf?" effect, but found it hard to escape some kind of musical logic - so they still "worked", even if functional analysis struggles to make sense of some of them (eg I Am the Walrus).

bVII is dominant functioning in aeolian. there is no real difference between IV-V-vi (ion) and bVI-bVII-i (aeol) from that perspective: only your choice of resolution triad (I or vi).

alot of my post was dedicated to (somewhat longwindedly and hamhandedly) trying to explain how you can't escape tonal function so easily, so sorry if it was a bit confusing or not clear.

&gt;and Ionian cadence must be non-functional, albeit them using the exact same tonic and set of notes. Same for minor vs. Aeolian

the problem is that (at least by my strict definition) cadences are inherently functional. my distinction here is that while IV-V-I is ionian, iv-V-I is not, as iv-V-I is major, but draws on a non-diatonic major scale.

one of the reasons why (minor) iv-V-i is so strong, is that this comes from the harmonic minor scale. the structure of its notes are such that it has no major tonic. bIII is augmented, and no other major triad supports a resolution either. even if in practise, the minor scales are all mixed together and bIII is rarely played as an augmented triad directly from harmonic minor, whenever you play the G#, it destabilises the major tonic.

&gt;In that sense, iim7b5-V7-i is not a native minor cadence, but it's a functional minor cadence (who said it must be diatonic?).

yeah. but that was the point. v-iv-i is strictly aeolian. "minor" encompasses a wide and very "general" notion of minor tonicity and shouldn't be confused. aeolian tonicity is something very specific, "minor" in general is very broad.

the thing is (and mostly my point in general), when you stay *strictly* diatonic, you are never truly "minor" or "major". from a tonal perspective, both I and vi are fully functional and legitimate and they coexist always, so long as you do not use any chromatic notes which shift the balance towards one or the other.

small example: in a Amin piece, using G# destabilises Cmaj contextually into C+ (even if you never play that triad augmented, but instead use it diatonic major version, using G# elsewhere supplies this context and suppresses the major tonic while exaggerating the minor). However, if you also add F# into the mix, Emaj becomes a stable major tonic via the melodic major mode (E F# G# A B C D), and suddenly Am and Emaj coexist. but anyway the strict melodic scale is weird and quite weak in itself, using *strict* melodic minor, your V triad has tonic function! but because we in practice combine it with elements from the diatonic and harmonic minor, so its tonic function in the melodic context is suppressed in a similar way to diatonic major's tonic function being suppressed via the raising of the 7th degree in minor. (so, maybe after this you can see, how the V-i tonal minor cadence involves alot more subtle goings-on than simply "i" gets a leading tone. therefore good!)

anyway, thats a digression from diatonic modes, but i think it helps to give some context with tonal functioning on a bigger scale.

&gt;In a C major song, a sudden resolution to Em or any deceptive cadence wouldn't make the whole song Phrygian.

of course not. nor does a single V-vi make a major song minor. the important thing is frequency, and how you treat them. if you start on iii, and almost always resolve to iii, it feels like the main tonic triad. the point there is to make the 3rd degree important in the tune through repetition, positioning with respect to other chords and other such devices. if you use iii as the tonic repeatedly, you can resolve V-I and the I feels (while powerful) deceptive, a treat it almost the same way as a deceptive cadence to bVI in aeolian. actually, i find I a better deceptive target for phrygian than vi, as iii is v/vi, and vi has a tendency to steal the modal focus away and make it sound more like "plagal aeolian" than phrygian.

this is what i mean by being careful of function when using modes, you can't simply ignore it: because it has an effect whether you like it or not. fortunately, function is only *one* of many devices you can use (like rhythm, meter, exaggeration, repetition etc..) to make one note/triad more important than another.

all things being equal, all chords being held for the same time at the same volume: I and vi have stronger focus than the others due to the structure of the diatonic scale itself. but if you play I offbeat for a shorter time, it's not so strong. again: it's how you use them.

i guess the most important thing is that returning the the modal tonic note sounds "non-deceptive". you can even write progressions that have multiple tonic chords that neither sound deceptive. the flogged to death pop progression IV-I-V-vi is a great example of this, it is both major and minor at the same time (although in that ordering i'd say vi has a bit more weight as its after the V) neither I nor vi have a full cadence preceding them that isn't interrupted by the other tonic)

&gt;The 5th is widely regarded as not necessary in major/minor chords

exactly because it is already present as part of the sound of the root. (and third in minor chords also), and is (usually) the strongest overtonal component at the 3rd harmonic. when you play A, E sounds also two octaves above it as part of the A.

honestly though, if you are voicing your tonic triad as i9 with no 5th, a cadence to it from iv will probably be a bit weakened. doesn't matter though: it was just about strength. omitting the fifth from v going to i in aeolian will similarily weaken the cadence: as an important part of that sound is the 2-&gt;b3 semitone. to some extent: semitones make cadences. note how weak the pentatonic scale is in that regard.

maybe i should have been more clear: (let's talk in C atm so i dont have to keep using numbers) the tritone is BF. the functional resolution of which is CE. B-&gt;C and F-&gt;E are both "leading tones" in this regard. although omitting the 5th is considered ok for voice leading purposes, when omitting the 5th also omits the leading tone, it's generally not recommended. to say that aeolian has no leading tone is erroneous: they are just in different positions and don't lead to 1. they lead to 3 and 5, likewise in major they lead to 1 and 3. this might be a bit of an abuse from the classical meaning of "leading tone", but i believe the general idea of what is/isnt functioning as a leading tone is too narrowly defined to be maj7-&gt;1 only.

if you have say an aeolian harmony written at the 10th, ending in a bVII-i cadence, your soprano melody is going B-&gt;C! that's the ionian leading tone movement! that it is harmonised as V-vi and not V-I does not matter: and since your melody is at the 10th and harmony aeolian, your main melody is necessarily ionian! (again, the difference between MELODIC modality and harmonic modality here)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5qqCRKwT9o this is an example of such 10th writing. that phrase would be impotent without the B-&gt;C leading tone. interestingly: this track also uses a tonal trick to take some "dorian" flavour while keeping it tonal minor. the IV is raised to major as in dorian, giving us a dorian nat6, and can be considered as from melodic minor. but unlike melodic minor, it switches straight back to diatonic and uses nat7 and bIV-bVII-i, with no melodic/harmonic maj7 shenaningans: giving it a more dorian feel than a melodic minor feel.

&gt;I think your point is that iii and IV could be established as "fake tonic" in major and minor?

&gt;Dorian and Mixolydian could very well be the tonic if we write the songs in their respective mode

yeah, the point was though: that iii and IV at least have some partial tonic functioning. ii and V do not. it's not so much that they are "fake", but rather, weaker in their tonic function and other more primary roles that you must subdue through context and how you use/approach them. IV is the counterparallel tonic to vi. but it's tonic relationship to I is much weaker, being the counterparallel tonic of the parallel tonic, but the primary subdominant of I.

that doesn't mean you can't establish dorian and mixolydian in *other* ways. but you can't lean on functionality to help you: it will fight you if you are not careful about it. it's more just to show how they are the more difficult modes (especially when full, dynamic harmony is concerned). Any mode, even locrian, can be held with a static harmony.

&gt;The normal use of "functional" implies "functional in a classical background".

i am referring here almost exclusively to riemannian function of the diatonic chords. look it up if you want. a word of warning though: as it is german, the meaning of the words "relative" and "parallel" are switched with respect to the english usage (and so Am is the parallel minor of Cmaj, and Cmin is the relative minor, confusing i know)

in this context, each chord is given function(s) classified into the 3 Tonic, Dominant and Subdominant categories, with the relations between them. with I being the major tonic, vi being the minor tonic or Major tonic parallel, iii being the major tonic counter parallel, and IV being the minor tonic counter parallel.

to wrap up, i realised alot of this is talking of TONAL harmony, not necessarily modal harmony. but i think one of the biggest struggles to modal writing that isn't solidified with a drone or pedal is in counteracting the strong tonal gravity of I and vi. you kindof need to understand how it works in order to avoid it (or use it's more subtle effects to your advantage)

the diatonic scale is a deep beast, and out of the 5 7 note scales, is by far the most flexible. this is probably why it is used as the "base prototype" scale, and we consider the other scales as "modifications" of the diatonic scale rather than the other way around.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-01-19 08:22:26 ljse7m<br>Counterpoint is an art of its own in addition to the best foundation you can have to truly understand Common Practice harmony. 

In Counterpoint uses multiple voices played together using certain parameters guiding the voices to form a mixture of interesting melodies working together to produce harmony that is a result of combining the melodies. The melodies are like the "voices" that outline and actually evolved into the Voice leading "rules" or conventions that you speak of in your question. Counter point uses basic rules of consonance and dissonance created between the voices and the harmony created by the interaction of the melodies evolved into the Common Practice chords of the CPP or Common Practice period. 

In counterpoint, you start with the melodies and the harmony eveolve from the voices. In Common practice harmony, also referred to Functional harmony will have a chord pattern that is the guide for the melody to be place over the harmony. 

I am suprised to hear that all modern theory books teach the rules of counterpoint beyond a very basic level at best. It could be that you just don't know how much there is to counterpoint to make that judgement, but in any case, Counterpoint is a whole different approach to music just as complex or possibly more complex than Common Practice functional harmony. Even though they are both sometimes coming up with the same harmonic implications, the way they got there and the focus of the composer and the attention of the listener. 

There are lots of different forms for counterpoint as well as their harmonic theory. There are canons, rounds, fugues, inventions, and each of these have lots of variations. You may find it interesting to listen to various contrapuntal compositions and you should start to get an idea of how it is different from Common Practice harmony and music in general. I would just go to You tube and do a generic search like "counterpoint" and/or the other forms I mentioned. That way you will get some various genres of counterpoint and see what style of counterpoint you like and then dig. If you like it, you will probably find that you need to get another book but there are good counterpoint books free on line that you can get. 

Its a whole new world of music if you have not heard much before and you owe it to yourself to try it to see if you like it.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-02-20 03:16:09 SinisterMinisterX<br>It makes sense, but there are more ways to create a sense of motion in music than changing harmonies. Your melody is already fast, rhythmically active, with a rising contour and a suspended dissonance at the end. You already have a lot going on in that single measure; be careful of overkill. You're already serving espresso, you may not need an additional shot of adrenaline!

For instance... if you write all the voice parts with the same melodic idea, you get the same "harmonized with the melody-note chords" effect... so at least one of your voices should be different, both rhythmically and melodically, unless the sound of a unison is your specific goal. That may be all you need: one contrasting counter-melody adds a lot to music.

But if you want to change chords over this melody, here's something to consider. There are three basic types of chord movement: movement of the root by a second, third or fifth. Like your melody, all your chords roots move by the interval of a third. This means, each chord has two of three tones in common with the previous chord, and the change in harmony is *least* dramatic, creating the least sense of motion. If you choose some changes that get the chord root moving by step or fifth, you'll create a much greater sense of motion, as more notes in the chords will actually change each time.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-03-04 00:12:16 KleosIII<br>Often times it is a lot simpler (the chords) than you think. You'd be suprised how good a simple I IV V can sound in specific context. The place where a chord falls into the harmony and the orchestration around it are what make it interesting.

With that said, my most complex harmonies are created when I am writing counter melodies. Thats is, I write a simple melody for a...flute, for example. Then I write another melody that compliments it on a clarinet. 


It is important to respect the role of rhythm as well. Don't just harmonize note by note. Use suspensions, pedal tones, and contrary motion to give it more personality.  Almost as if the instruments are having a conversation.

 Add some context strings or brass or choir in the background, and a solid bass, then leave the rest to your meter and rhythm(for energy). That is most film/game composing as far as harmony contruction is concerned.   
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-03-17 21:37:15 Jongtr<br>That reminds me of a classic Joni Mitchell sequence, [Marcie:] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24PsI-ehDwc)  
Bb6 - A7 - Am7 - G  
She repeated that, then went up to:  
Eb - D - C - B  
and back to Bb6 and on down.  It all hangs together beautifully, helped by the melody of course, which has little ascending passages to counter the descent.

If we're gonna rephrase the question so that all "Nitpicky Nick's" out there can put two and two together: "What instruments are the synths trying to mimic?"

And my guess would be: Ocarina on the main melody, tambourine laying down the beat and also clarinet and oboe doing counter melodies and filling in.      

Edit: also my guesses were way out there. Somehow misread it as "Saria's Song" first. Whoopsie.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-04-16 17:29:51 furnavi<br>Learning how to improvise is a great tool for a composer. It develops your ability to create original music quickly.

A good way to start improvising is to ornament (add notes) to existing melodies. Try humming an ornamented Melody while listening to your favorite music. Listen to what works and what doesn't. Also pay attention to how your new melody changes the emotion of the original one.

As you get more experienced, try forming a counter melody to a piece in harmony with the original. Again, listen if your melody sounds good and how it makes you feel. With practice, you will begin to notice patterns that allow you to make a working melody more quickly.

Another fun thing to try is listening to something new and periodically pausing it. Can you predict what will happen next? Again you will notice patterns as well as the paths that can be taken. Composing and improvising is essentially predicting, but instead your predictions become creations.

After you learn some basic theory, try playing chords in your left hand on the piano and either sing or play a melody in your right hand. Notice how notes in the chord can serve as a base for creating melodies that move between them. A really easy progression to start on is I IV V I. which in C major is CEG, FAC, GBD, CEG. Those roman numerals just indicate what number note in the scale the chord starts on.

If you are just starting out making melodies, try the pentatonic scale. It only has 5 notes rather than the usual 7, and it's very easy to use. A quick way to get it is to play just the black notes on the piano starting from F# / Gb. If you want the pentatonic scale starting on C, it is CDEGB. Chinese music uses this scale pretty much exclusively. Japanese music also uses it quite a bit as do many other cultures.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-04-23 21:20:03 sebastos3<br>you might want to look into binary and ternary forms, which is a way to order your composition according to sections. there is also a number of ways to vary your melodies such as transposing it up a note or two while still keeping it in the scale, you could modulate to another scale(major to minor minor to major or maybe a mode), in fugues there is something called subjects and counter subjects, where you make the second melody contrast the first in some way. what also might be usefull is looking into the way basic progression models work in the context of cadences, as you can order your melodies around that to make for satisfying beginnings and endings.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-04-26 04:25:35 ljse7m<br>The genre helps. So for pop songs, you can start to get the feel for melody by starting with the Pentatonic scale. It has served pop music for melodic purposes quite well for a long time both in blues and non blues pop Music. You can use if from any rotation as all five "modes" of major pentatonic (Do Re Mi Sol La) will be easy to sing and the singer will be more likely to be in tune as well as the audience that will hopefully be singing along with your song. 

The pentatonic scales are the easiest scales to sing in so the audience can identify with them more easily and thus are more likely to capture their interest rather than a song that is difficult for them to sing. 

That said, if you want to add the Fa and Ti or any other notes for effect, that is fine as well but keep in mind that for Pop music, you want the song to be easily sung by the AUDIENCE! They are the ones that will be buying the record so you should keep them in mind when writing the song. Also, a simple but unique "hook" is something that you want to strive for. 

Now the instrumental melodies of counter melodies are another matter. Here you are looking to get the attention of the guitar players or other instrumental aficionados so it can be more complex as you are directing your attention to a more musically trained audience. When you mix the instrumental and the vocal, try not to let one interfere with the other. If you do, you will be blocking both the musicians and the audience at the same time and each one will distract from the other so be careful. If you do mix them, a conversational approach is a good way to mix them as you will be shifting the audience's interest back and forth and not having one compete with the other.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-05-19 12:00:02 ljse7m<br>Sounds like what I would call "parameters" as I see that as being layers of simple concepts layered over each other. But I don't get this from Schenker, its just how music is put together. 

I have never really understood how what I could glean from Schenker is anything but restating the obvious. Kodaly organizes his view of the concepts that define music into about 5 basic elements (depending upon how you want to count them) and these 5 elements are all very simple in theory, but become more complicated as one explores their various applications and combines them simultaneously creating multiple and layers of simple things to shape a more composite, seemingly complex whole until you sort them out. 

The thing is, when you try to do a "visual" analysis of these elements, the analysis becomes more complex than the music itself.  For example, if you start with a simple melody like even Twinkle Twinkle, you have one layer of the succession of notes with their rise and fall. Lets consider that one dimension. Then you overlay a rhythmic pattern and you have another dimension. If you then take the resulting or added harmonic pattern, you are getting into three dimensions. Now, when doing a visual, we start to have a problem. We are at the edge of what can be visualized in a two dimensional representation like a diagram. But we still only have a simple one line melody, with an underlying simple chordal pattern, and a time element of how these three (?) elements are combined. But upon analysis, there are various ways the melody and harmony. 

The melody however follows a pattern described as form and the way the motifs are combined create another "dimension" to distinguish it from another song using the same notes but there are simple shapes formed by these motifs that are undulating over the rhythm of the chord progression and if you happen to add a counter melody by giving a melodic shape to the bass line instead of just roots, the combination which is now, depending upon how you have been counting has progressed to at least four dimensions and possibly five or more and with the new countermelody of the bass interacting with the other elements we have several other things happening that has to be visualized in the diagram. We now have exponential progressions of concepts that need to be visualized. 

This is of course an extreme oversimplification but it is still a very simple song being complex before the addition of the secondary melody and then we now have more dimensions than we can meaningfully express with a diagram! 

But we basically have Twinkle Twinkle with a melodic bass line. 

If you try to put all of this into a diagram or a simplified score like visual representation, it gets more complicated than it needs to be but  that is what I get out of Schenker. Its simply more complicated way of trying to put too much information into ONE visual representation when a simple narrative to describe what a trained musician or theorist hears as a simple melody, with a simple chord progression and a bass line other than the roots. 

The only reason I added the melodic bass line is to give that unique element that seems to be necessary in a Schenker analysis and a chord progression with roots in the bass helps to show how the element of harmony can be just the chords OR can be two elements of the analysis with just that same simple variation of one of the previous elements and how even a simple chord progression can be made to be more complex as it adds the contrapuntal aspect to the mix. 

So this is the problem. Its not really possible to illustrate all of the elements that make the musical piece what it is. Even the simplest of musical pieces like Twinkle becomes difficult of impossible to give complete representation of what is there. That is why in a traditional analysis, there is a "narrative". After the appropriate analytical method is applied to the particular genre or style of the composition, a narrative is compiled to explain what unique applications of the composition contribute to his artistic merit. 

Schenker illustrations can be well done or not. I have tried to find another way of looking at Schenker but so far to no avail. To me, Schenker is more of a visual arts presentation of a traditional analysis and if you take away the visual aspect of Schenker, we are left with the traditional narrative part of analysis without the appropriate theory to match the music involved. 

He seems to be focused even in the narrative to want to paint a picture of what makes the piece what it is. I would hope that someone can tell me what I am missing with this assessment of Schenker. I do not proport to be an expert of his style of analysis but that is because to me, it seems to be dependent on using the traditional styles of analysis as a prerequisite for doing the visual aspect and I just find that too subjective to be of any real use no matter how beautiful it is. I don't think that he is irrelevant, just redundant. 

I think your narrative description is AT LEST as good or better than any that I have heard, but still, I don't see much that actually tells me how to create an artistic composition using the end result of the visual or computer generated representation of the music after it is created. 

Do you have any ideas of hot to Back Out of the abstract computational process to tell me how to create a composition? I still find that the concept of overlying parameters, each being depicted in musical contexts is something I can use to plan a composition in a much more pragmatic manner. I also think that we may be saying a lot of the same thing in different manner in a lot of ways although I don't see the "parameter" aspect to be separated in your short post. That, however would be asking a lot from a rather short reddit post 

Thanks for sharing you views on Schenker. It almost sounds like there is something to it! lol I do tend to emphasize the pragmatic aspect of musical theory and that is what I see missing still in this post. Maybe you will be able to point how Schenker can be used by the composer or improvisor where so many others have failed.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-05-26 21:36:54 ljse7m<br>Two questions that need to be answered before I can give any suggestions. 

How high of a level do you play the piano? 

What composers and styles of piano do you play fluently? 

AND a THIRD:

What about your composing level? Can you compose what you would call good music in genres other than Bach with sus2 chords.?

Without your answer to those questions all I can do is vague speculations. 

Blocky chordal structures: If you think vertically you are thinking block chords. You need to think horozontally. Part writing, and counterpoint. These are two horizontal concepts and without thinking horizontally, what else is left besides block chordal textures? You can dress them up with harmonic rhythm and arpeggiations  etc that an arpeggio is simply a block chord broken up by strumming up and down the block chord. 

Left hand Bass: This seems strange after your reference to Bach. Do you find that Bach only writes Roots in his bass lines? Yes, he uses roots often, it is the style of that early phase of functional harmony. The audience (and musicians in general) had to have the new non linear (horizontal) approach to music reinforced. But then there are his fugues! Fugues are not generally defined by their bass lines. 

You have to write melodic bass lines unless you want to have non melodic bass lines. 

Write a melody, write a counter melody bass line. harmonize the piece using good part writing techniques. Break that up with counter melodic phrases, some arpeggiation, some block, leave out some notes from the chords and concentrate on the essence of the harmony and do all of this on paper (or digital scores) and work your ideas in a pianistic style. (this is where your piano technique comes in) You can't write like Debussy if you play like a Bach Organist. (just an example) One of a composer's biggest challenge is to learn the characteristics of the instruments he is composing for and playing that instrument should be an asset and not a liability. 

If, as your post suggests, you can't conceive the piano music through improvisation, you have to either learn to improvise on the piano better OR in the meantime, you have to do it on sketches of what you would LIKE to be able to play on the piano and then fill in the blanks slowly and meticulously on the score. 

This all brings us to another important question. What piano music do you listen to that is close to what you consider GOOD piano music? As you learn to improvise or compose from sketches on a score and use learned techniques to create piano music, you have to somehow know what it will sound like when you write it. 

This may sound blunt but so does the framing of your post. There are techniques to address all the issues I bring up. You have to evaluate what your aims are more exactly as well as what tools you already have to reach those goals and then learn the skills you need to do what you are aiming for with your compositions. 

I hope this helps. To recap, answer the questions and I can get more specific. If you are inhibited to be that open in public, contact me privately. PM or through my site. But you, me or someone needs to help you assess what you want to do and what skills you need to do them and how can build those skills.

It's a cool sound and gets used in jazz somewhat regularly. In My Funny Valentine it's a part of a chord progression that implies a descending counter melody. 

Cmin - Cmin (maj7) - Cmin7 - Cmin6

[Brainville by Sun Ra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZZ-oZKaIXg) has 2 repeating minor major 7 chords in the intro and the first 4 bars of the A section. 

Also [Forecast by Ben Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sao2tnp5KMk) has a solo vamp consisting of Emin major7 and Ab min13. I only know this cause I played the tune and transcribed it.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-07-05 06:19:23 immig50<br>I think you're close. Most of the parts would be kind of considered counter melodies or "contrapuntal" parts. Which means they break off from the melody and aren't direct harmonies at certain points. 

The main parts seem to be layered octaves and 5ths with some of the harmonies following the melody, then breaking off at different points.  Most of the harmonies switch to a contrapuntal approach when the lead melody is holding longer notes. 

The Beach Boys (Brian Wilson) were really good at happier sounding contrapuntal "harmonies" where the group would directly harmonize with the main melody, then the backgrounds would split off into something completely different, and then morph back into a direct harmony.

also, op, ever have a melody pop in your head? like, you're listening to a song and suddenly you think of a pretty cool sounding variation or counter-melody? ever dream of a melody in your sleep and wake up and think "oh shit that sounded neat." well, instead of going back to bed to inevitably forget it within seconds, get out your voice recorder immediately and hum it out.

then dick around with it later.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-08-28 14:26:07 jorbanead<br>If you start with a melody, the next step is often writing a baseline (or counter melody). There are a lot of rules about how to do this, so you could look up 'first species counterpoint' and it'll explain the basics. 

After you have a melody and bass line, then you can figure out the rest of the harmonies from there. Remember, the bass note might not always be the root of the chord, but often it is. You also don't want to have too many leaps or awkward intervals when doing voice leading, but this should all be outlined in the counterpoint rules. 

Rules are meant to be broken. But as the saying goes "you have to learn the rules like a professional in order to break them like an artist" 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-09-16 02:24:51 TRexRoboParty<br>There's no reason a song needs to stay in one key throughout.
In fact, it's often kind of boring if they do.
Modulating and using chords borrowed from other keys is a classic way to create movement in a piece

As for the chorus, those 4 chords are *super* common in pop/rock.

The tonic of the chorus is the **E minor**. (i.e E Aeolian). 
Noodle some E minor licks over the chorus and you'll find they fit.

If you relate that back to the relative major (G major as you noted), you can see the D chord for example is functioning as a dominant. "Normally" D7 would resolve to G major, but as Em is a substitute of Gmaj, it works very nicely. 

Part of the effectiveness is also the contrast with the verse. Different rhythm, diatonic chords rather than a dissonant riff, a strong simple melody to counter the throaty shouts etc.

A whole song of diatonic chords in one key gets dull pretty quickly.

It's a tried and tested formula to have (at least) 2 contrasting sections. This ruled most 90s rock. Nirvana are probably the best example:
Quieter verse, usually a little more rhythmic/angular sounding. 
Then big loud/open chorus. Let chords ring out, open hi-hat etc.

They took the formula from the Pixies and pushed the contrast up (as did a tonne of other bands).

Foos kept that formula but focused more on melody and are tamer with dissonance. Here they opt for a high energy verse and quieter chorus - it's usually the other way round - but keep most of the other elements very much intact.

I've bought some orchestral sample libraries, picked a violin, hit a note... listen to it, and than ... something comes to my mind. Whatever comes to my mind... I'll add to the midi step by step. Then again I'll listen to it and something else comes to my mind that will fill the next bar. I just keep doing this, adding more stuff that pops up in my mind. Then when I finished my main melody I pick another instrument, which in this case was the flute... I started with the violin. Then again, I'll do the same process... I'll listen to the melody and a counter-melody pops up so I'll add that until I finished the whole counter melody. Than I've added a cello and came up with some bass notes that would fit and that all goes well until I need to find the chords. 

I tried making triads from the bass notes (which sounded good) but the triads... are just not it. It aren't the right chords. I'll try to come up with something based on the amazing advice I already received on this topic and post it here again.

I've watched some tutorials on the circle of fifths but still don't completely understand it. Whenever I try to make music based on theory, I fail. When I make music without rules, just translating from my head, I succeed but I just can't connect the music from my head with the theory. I guess this just takes time and practice.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-02 12:24:07 Hexspa<br>Good point but what you're saying removes context.  

Just ask PewDie Pie, context matters.  

The harmony was always there, even in Gregorian Chant, just no one knew it at the time.  

Today, we know about harmony.  Harmony can always be added, and in ways, is always implied.

If I hear you correctly, harmony is secondary, and I agree.  

I'm not familiar with Cantaloube.  

My intention was to simplify the matter at the expense of obvious innumerable counter-details.  

I'll have to check out your reference but, still, melody as we consider it, tends to be more free than the strong-beat constructs we're used to; though related to those.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-07 03:41:38 Wolfey1618<br>That entirely depends on context and the type of music. There can be times where you want to have the singer on top singing the melody, and maybe an instrument playing a counter-melody or harmonized melody. 

There can also be times where an instrument is playing the melody, and the vocals could be accompanying it. 

You can have songs without either of those too. Not really sure what you're asking, but I hope that helped.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-20 16:34:45 Geromusic<br>There's a C drone in the bass throughout the entire song, and it changes mode.  

The first part is in C minor.  Most of the time it's using C harmonic minor with the B natural, but the Bb from C natural minor also appears.  

At the line "The beauty of me,"  at 1:30 the word "me" is the major third.  Combined with the minor sixth in the word "beauty" this implies a change of mode to C phrygian dominant, if you want one scale that contains all the notes.  You can also look at it as changing mode from C minor over "The beauty of" to C major over "me", and I think I prefer this interpretation.  

When the "Tired are your splendid soldiers" line starts at 3:23 there's another change of mode to C mixolydian.  This is superimposed over a counter-melody that includes the minor sixth, suggesting C minor or phrygian dominant at the same time (bimodality).  At 3:53 the minor sixth is gone and it's all C mixolydian to the end of the song. 

Cheers!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-25 06:07:17 65TwinReverbRI<br>I agree with you, but maybe for different reasons..

I tend to think of a "counter-melody" as an independent melody heard in conjunction with another independent melody, but primarily in homophonic textures, and often either or both melodies have been heard before. But, for example, the piccolo part in "Stars and Stripes Forever" is a textbook example of a counter-melody (but not the only form c-ms take by any means). A popular music example I discussed elsewhere is Paul and Linda McCartney's vocal parts in "Silly Love Songs" in the "break down". Something like the two guitar parts in Eagles "Already Gone" (where one is primarily sustained notes, but certainly "independently melodic" enough and the other plays a busier part could qualify as well.

But I also don't define polyphony as *specifically* "of equal interest". Instead, polyphony focuses on the horizontal, rather than the vertical, and independence of the lines. They don't necessarily have to be "equal" though. That is, they generally form a cohesive whole (texture) though one part, such as the soprano, or the bass, or even an inner voice - especially if they carry an important motive or melody (such as a harmonization of a hymn tune which should have been the most familiar part) - may be more prominent than the rest of the texture, but not to the point of homophony.

Furthermore, from a stylistic standpoint, I'd rarely call a counter-subject a "counter-melody" partly becuase of the specificity of the term counter-subject in context (i.e. a fugue) and partly because it's more "just counterpoint" by comparison.

IOW, while we can call lines and parts "melodies" and we can say something like a Chorale is "made up of multiple melodies", they aren't things you'd hear "on their own". They are part of, and maybe even reliant on, the polyphonic texture. Their "reason for being" if you will is not to make an independent (isolated) melodic statement, but to "support" as a member of the team, the polyphonic texture.

Likewise, I'd never call a 2 Part Invention made of a "melody" and "counter-melody".

Of course there are potential grey areas, such as double or larger fugues or imitation where multiple subjects are treated simultaneously - but still I generally define them as "counterpoint" and "polyphony" not "counter-melodies".

Grey areas area always tough, and I'd rather paint broad strokes encapsulating the "average" of what is polyphony versus what is homophony and counter-melody, rather than a thin dividing line. But that's the beauty of music - it doesn't have to be either or, it can be anything along a continuum.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-26 05:16:45 65TwinReverbRI<br>Great example - a tour de force of compositional techniques. Snicker - you said "homophobic" by mistake ha ha.

I'm not sure though we're using the "homo-" terms similarly.

I consider the opening to be HomoRHYTHM. It's still Polyphony though. It's, if you like, a Homorhythmic Polyphonic section.

This in contrast to an "Imitative" or just "Contrapuntal" section.

After the the monophonic "trade off" section, you get a previously heard motive accompanied by what is essentially the rhythmic motive of the homorhythmic section. Again I wouldn't use "counter melody" to describe these as they're more like contrapuntal "subjects" and just "counterpoint" or "imitation" though there's no denying they're coming from already-heard ideas. But really more "Fugal" than anything (which implies polyphonic, imitative counterpoint!).

There's nothing here I'd call "Homophonic" (or homophobic ;-)  in terms of the classical definition of "melody with accompaniment". But we're very close to that in the "king of kings" sections.

I suppose the distinction is that with a "typical" Homophonic texture, your accompanying voices aren't necessarily very contrapuntal in and of themselves - the more coalesce into a "chord" rather than a "harmony implied with counterpoint".

Lot of grey area there of course but I'm thinking of something like an Aria - Rejoice Greatly for example - where the accompaniment is really a "unit" that's not necessarily contrapuntal itself (and let's say there's a spectrum there as well) and is really "subervient to" the melody.

Even though "king of kings" is long notes and stands out because of that, it's almost more like a typical long note fugue subject against a more active counterpoint than, say, Mozart's Piano Sonata in C (the one everyone's heard!).

But overall, yes, there are some wonderful examples here of linearity versus verticality, then, "dual linearity" as well.

As an interesting aside, when you hear most people sing the chorus, they sing the *moving* note melody, not the static upper voice! That's where this gets interesting because different things can pull our ears in different directions in different textures!


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-11-07 12:14:11 DonutsMcKenzie<br>&gt; I'm not a great (or even a good) guitiarist but I grabbed my guitar and tried to think through this a bit but realistically, even if I grabbed a ii-V-I progression... I just have to think differently. I basically learn the shape of the progression (or the chords in that progression) I want to make with smooth voice leading and the only thing I actually have to think about is the roots and what string they are going to be on. Everything that follows is a shape, which is probably similar to your problem... read a chord, ad hoc an appropriate voicing. At best you're thinking of the root and the melody note you might want ton top, but you don't have to think of the spelling. And if you wanted to do his in every key... well, you just slide up and down the fret board.

Absolutely spot on. This is my problem for sure, and I it applies to a lot of guitarists in general. Because the guitar is essentially a big grid of notes it's very easy to visualize the shapes of certain chords relative to any given root. Even though I feel like I'm pretty aware of the chord tones within those shapes, it's all relatively 'visual' and predictable in a way that piano isn't for me (at least right now).

Thanks for the detailed response, and I think it does help me quite a bit. I'll definitely take a crack at your exercises tonight on both guitar and piano. I really appreciate all the time you must have put into helping me with this!

I think the thing that is difficult for me on both instruments, but especially piano for some reason, is i'm always thinking about the roots (that's what's in the chart, after all) and I'm aiming for notes that are *relative to* the root, but the voicings are all mixed up or even completely rootless so it's all very counter-intuitive, if that makes sense. So yeah, I'll record a bunch of roots and just strip everything down to 3&amp;7 and really think about chords tones along the way.

I'm not sure how much you've done already, but you're kind of not supposed to write your own Cantus Firmus.

It means "fixed song" and that kind of implies that it is a pre-existing melody you've taken from somewhere else and that's how species counterpoint approaches it typically as well.

There are aspects about it you typically wouldn't find in traditional C.F.

And there's a further problem - most of us are listening with modern, western ears.

C.F. from Fux and what not were based in modal styles.

So this, as a "melody" on it's own, not only doesn't follow some general guidelines of C.F., but it also doesn't follow some elements of typical tonal melody writing that might give some listeners pause.

They might then, in that context, think it's "bad".

The F-G-B thing is outlining a Tritone, so not so good. From a tonal standpoint, B is the leading tone of C, and you've ascended up to it - everyone expects it to resolve up to the high C. It doesn't.

One general (general mind you) about writing like this is that after a leap, you should go the opposite direction. Usually it's also stated that the larger the leap, the more of a necessity it is to go the opposite direction after, sometimes even "counter-balancing" with another small leap.

C-D-F-E (the Mozart Jupiter motive, which has 5 part invertible counterpoint so he knew what he was doing) is a somewhat "more typical" move.

But C-D-F-G is not horrible.

However, following it then with the E-F-G-B bit sounds a little "too classical" in a 4 note motive repeated higher, and, it sort of just "climbs similarly" up a bit higher (that by the way will add to the confusion of those hearing it in a tonal light).

That the last 4 are just the first 4 backwards is a bit, maybe, atypical of your typical supplied C.F. ideas. 

In fact, try this, change the B to the same note as the starting C.

I think you'll hear something that sounds very "sing-songy" and melodic, not unlike maybe a typical nursery song or something.

Now, is it "bad" - well, I bet you could write a counterpoint to it that worked well - but that didn't necessarily follow the "rules" strictly - which would be appropriate.

Likewise, I could see this as a long note melody with a string sound over top of some chords that could sound quite beautiful in a modern context - and that could be made to where that B wouldn't even bother tonally-influenced listeners.

Let me ask you this: What is your end goal here?

Is it just to learn Species Counterpoint?

Or are you trying to write music, using contrapuntal techniques? (and if so, why - are you fascinated by counterpoint, or feel it's a challenge and want to see if you can do it, or do you want to write music and you think you need to know counterpoint, etc.)

The problem is that the trumpet part will not be the main part, which is what search engines would want. "Fills" or "counter-melody" are the right words, but probably won't help a search engine.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-12-21 11:55:17 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;And, your point on how we voice chords in tertian-based harmony, maybe we should have some system for defining what the exact voicings are as well. I don't foresee quartal voicing notation and tertian voicing notation like such in the near future, but we can hope to get more specific.

&gt;It does raise a point, though, that we do technically have a system for defining what notes are played exactly, I can't recall the name exactly but I believe it uses numbers to say how notes are placed in a chord, much like how we can use 1 3 5 b7 to voice a dominant seventh chord, but it is a lot more specific than that.

That is my point. If you want a system for quartal voicings, fine, but really, you need it for all voicings. You may be thinking of Figured Bass for the other. But as I said, when you get to this point, you might as well just notate things.

IOW, you mention "proper" symbols. But the "proper" way to use symbols is not to specify voicing - tertian or otherwise. Just because the chord is quartally voiced doesn't mean we should treat these any differently. When we put "C9" the player may leave out the G. They may leave out the C as well if someone else has it. And they may play Gm, Em7b5, F#9 or some other substitute. It's Jazz. They're "suggestions" not specific.

I doubt at this point anyone capable of playing So What hasn't heard So What, and I would also assume the melody note would be written. So even if they get Em11 and the proper melody note, they'd probably voice 4ths if they know the tune and the right melody note would be on top anyway.

But again, Jazz players just sometimes accompany.

In a sense - Jazz people (and pop people) need to get over this idea that chord symbols should notate everything specifically becuase that's actually counter to their intent (Figured Bass is actually similar). We use notes for specific notation.

So What has this "mythology" around it and so does "quartal harmony" (really quartal voicings) so naturally "playing it your own way" seems to be more taboo than "I Got Rhythm".

I think all you really need is something like Em11(q) or Cm7sus4(q) to tell people it is, or you'd like it to be a Quartally voiced chord.



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-06 07:45:07 65TwinReverbRI<br>It depends.

Roman Numeral analysis is really "designed" if you will for Tonal music, and in that context, the numerals carry more information than just "naming the chord".

We don't (or shouldn't) use Roman Numeral analysis on pre-Tonal music (aside from drawing connections for music that is close to Tonality) becuase it doesn't tell us anything. It simply "names the chords" (which may actually be counter-productive in more linear-based music).

Roman Numeral analysis of post-Tonal music is likewise not very useful unless there is some element it can point out that is common enough to be worth mentioning.

I've seen analyses of certain Debussy pieces where a Roman Numeral analysis actually shows how the work has strong ties to tonal functional progressions.

In Les Cloches, it certainly doesn't make sense to label every single chord in the opening accompaniment. It may be worth pointing out the neighbor motion of the harmony sets up a nice "swaying" sound. It might be interesting to note that while the pattern itself ascends, harmonically it sort of descends (F#m7/C# to EMaj7/D#-E). It may be interesting to note that the chords are both inverted, save for that last 8th note but at the end of the first phrase, we finally get an F# bass note and no harmonic change.

What key is it in? Key sig says E or C#m - it ends on a nice E Major chord - so if so, this must be ii4/3 - IM4/2

That tells us the roots are a 2nd apart, that they're both 7th chords that are inverted. It might tell someone more familiar that the 7ths aren't resolving an that the Tonic chord isn't a triad (though one might be able to make a case that the D# is an Appoggiatura).

But do those labels convey all that information effectively?

The A# in measure 9 is certainly reminiscent of a V7/V and it moves to a V (9)

Is that worth pointing out?

What about the final cadence - how is that like, or unlike traditional cadences - does a simple chord label say enough about that?

This kind of music reminds me of Early Music - Rennaisance music and before. It uses "chords" which in many cases are familiar to us. They're also sometimes used in ways that are familiar to us. But labelling them with Roman Numerals doesn't really convey the important aspects of Modal music that we'd probably want to point out. Chord labels might tell us how it's similar to Tonal music, but not how it differs.

Furthermore, it has a tendency to make us look at everything through a "Tonal lens" and at the worst, compare it unfavorably because it doesn't meet those stylistic standards.

I see post-Tonal music - including pop and jazz as the exact same way. Sure, it uses chords, some familiar, and it uses ideas, some familiar, but IMHO we should actually break with Tonality completely and develop a new system for analysis - because it does become just "naming the chords" not unlike we'd do with Palestrina. It's fine for pieces that are highly indebted to tonal style or clearly evolved from it, but for other music it makes no sense (or doesn't tell us anything we don't already know).

I would encourage you to move beyond harmony and look at larger things - form, phrase, melody, and with harmony, look it too in broader strokes, like "upward motion" or "voice exchange" and principles like that rather than getting into properly labeling each chord.

However, you can still discover stuff like, hey, this composer really likes going from X to Y as a parallel to (substitute for, analog of) a Plagal-like cadence. That can help you to discover stylistic traits of individual composers or schools of composition.

So go through and figure out the chords, and look for larger and repeated processes, but don't get too bogged down in the labeling of chords - if doing so reveals some important aspect, then by all means do, but otherwise, often the general shape is enough.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-08 06:48:33 broodfood<br>I understand what they mean by it having compositional problems, but it's not the chord progression in particular. It has to do with how the melody and counter melody are arranged over it. There's a lot of times when the two melodies play the same or almost the same notes, and it blends them together and it's hard to follow one or the other. Or the melody emphasizes non chord tones in a way that doesn't really pay off or feel deliberate.

Since most of theory is concerned with harmony, what chords lead where and what to call such and such scale, I don't think you'll find the answers there. 

That said, I'm not sure exactly where you would find the answers. A song production blog or something? And in the end, your song isn't terrible or anything, it's just hard to listen with an outsiders ear when you've been living inside a track for however long you've worked on it. Besides, art is subjective and etc etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-26 14:14:26 blueyeswhiteprivlege<br>I love the music from this game (imo it's one of the best video game soundtracks ever written and basically my childhood), so I'll try to analyze and explain the piece as best as I can (sorry if I go a little too heavy on the jargon or get a little obtuse, I tend geek out about this stuff lol):

You can essentially break the actual composition down into four parts: the bassline, the arpeggiated accompaniment, the melody, and a single counter melody part (if you can even call it that, it's basically just the melody a third above). There's also a tambourine I think, but that's not important. I'll tackle the accompaniment first.

The accompaniment is based on a repeating chord 8-bar chord progression (F: I | iii V7/vi | vi V+/vi** | I viiø7/V*** | IV | ii | V7sus4 | V7 :||). The only time it ever deviates from this progression is in the bar-and-a-half pick-up, which is just a simple I64 - V65 to lead into the main part of it. The accompaniment pattern is also constant. It ascends up the chord for one beat, then "accents" the second beat by adding an interval, and then the last note descends back down to lead into the next chord on the 3rd beat of the measure or the 1st beat of the next measure. That's the typical pattern, but it does mix it up a little bit for some added flavor.

The bassline's even simpler. The rhythm's a constant:

♩ , ♪ ♪ ♩ ♪ | ♩ , ♪ ♪ ♩ ♪ | ♩ , ♪ ♪ ♩ ♪ | ♩ , ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ :||

with the commas (,) representing 8th rests. It never deviates from this rhythm (not counting the pick-up, obviously). Ever. 99% of the time, the bass part is just playing chord tones, and it's usually just the root and 5th of the chord. The range is usually within C2-C3 centering around F, but it does drop down to B♭1 a couple of times and hits C4 a few times too. Interestingly, the rests on the start of the second beat and the quarter note getting "tied" into the 4th beat both happen when the accompaniment part is adding those intervals in for emphasis. Basically, the bass takes a break twice a measure so as not to distract from the accompaniment. I think that's a really clever little detail!

Ok, so, one of the most important things about the bass and accompaniment is how simple it is. There's two reasons for this: 1) it's good for looping the track endlessly, and b) the unconvential (by VGM standards at least) chord-progression provides enough interest so as to not be boring, and the constant rhythm and accompaniment pattern lets the melody (the mainy focus here) take center stage and doesn't distract from it. It also establishes a nice little groove in there too, which is a bonus. Finally, the lack of any sort of complex counterpoint lends to the "homely" or "folksy" vibe of the piece, which I think fits well with Littleroot. 

Now, obviously, the melody is what really creates a lot of the "charm" here. There's really only one melody here, and then two variations on it before it loops again. It's an 8-bar period, divided into two 4-bar phrases. The first phrase is rhytmically more exciting (it uses a lot more dotted quarter notes and eighth notes), and the second is more "lax" (relying more on half notes). This gives a good contrast between the two phrases to keep it more interesting. The rhythm is also kept incredibly simple, and it doesn't use a lot of unusual or fast-paced rhythms or long-winded scale runs.

Melodically, it sticks mainly to steps and skips and other intervals that are easy to sing.  Most of the larger leaps are confined to the start of motives in the melody, and usually come after longer notes. This makes the melody more singeable, since those simple steps fit nicely in the human voice and it allows a little time to breathe before tackling those larger leaps. The overall choice of notes is also important. Outside of those grace notes, the only chromatically altered tone in the melody is a single C#, which only occurs on the second part of the 4th beat of the measure and is obviously part of a cadence. It also doesn't throw much weight into the leading tone, which I think also adds to the folksy charm of it. A lot of Folk melodies just flat out avoid the leading tone (and, usually, the 4th), and most of the E's here are passing tones or neighbor tones. There's one (one!) exception to it, and it occurs at the end of the period. Ditto with the 4th of the scale. Also, side note: the first phrase tends to hover around the 3rd (A), while the second focuses more on the tonic (F).

It's also important to note that the melody is mostly made up of reoccuring and varied motives. Those grace notes are one: they always occur on the strong beat and are always a half-step below the target note. They also frequently come right before the higher notes of the piece, which makes it a little easier to "slide in" to those high notes and makes it more singeable imo. The first phrase regularly plays around with that three note ascending motive that shows up in the pick-up a lot. The second phrase also has some blatant motives too: it regularly hits the tonic F with those long notes and has that two-beat descending pattern.

The two variations mostly play around with timing and adding a bit of spice to the melody. There's a lot more syncopation (usually by delaying the first beat by an eighth note by shortening the first note of a measure and adding an eighth note on the first beat), and the first variation adds a few more grace notes and doubles the melody in parallel thirds. The second variation is a lot more different and focuses more on playing with the slower second phrase, which creates a sort-of contrasting middle section. It's playing with that sense of "there, and back again" that forms the basis for pretty much all music. It progressively gets farther and farther from the initial melody (home), before taking advantage of the medium restrains and using the loop to return "home". But, the whole time there's this "sense of home" buried within the more out-there variations on the melody. You can always pick out the motives that make up the melody in that second variation, no matter how "out there" it gets. I think that's fitting for the home town theme.

Also, instrumentation! Trading the melody and accompaniment parts off between different instruments creates a feeling of a folk band jamming and playing around with a melody, passing it back and forth between different members who all put their own spin on it. There's even a total unnecessary tambourine part! It also adds a lot of color to the melody and accompaniment and makes it even more interesting.

Hopefully that's enough detail! Go Ichinose is a mad genius.

Notes:

**  This is mostly just some good ol' fashioned Late Romantic voice leading here. The chord is better analyzed as moving chromatically from D - C# - C with the other two voices just being lazy bums and staying put. It's not really a strong function, but it sure sounds pretty!

*** It's a bø7 in the key of F, which is followed by a B♭ chord. You could label this as a viiø7/V, moving deceptively to IV - ii before going back to V (which could work I guess). But, again, I think it's just a Late Romantic Chromatic Voice Leading Chord (TM), with chromatic lines from C - B - B♭, the A remaining constant to keep that close chromatic relationship to B♭, and the C moving to D. There's also a random G on the last note of the measure in the accompaniment (the only NCT in the accompaniment part!), but that's just spice if you ask me.

See if you can chart out the form with as much detail as possible as to what the band is doing. Train your ear (or look at a score) to hear what each section is playing and how they are playing it, eg. unison/octaves/chords(4-way close, drop-2, etc).

Something like this:

Intro - 8 bars, rhythm section only, guitar Freddie Greene, piano fills

Head 

A - two altos in thirds, brass play a fill at the turnaround

A2 - altos again on melody, trumpets (at least 2 in unison, maybe all 4) add a counter melody, bones start comping in short staccato punches with spread voicings

Bridge - full band in brick shithouse Basie-style block chords

A - like A2, 2-bar lead in to a brass shout for next chorus

etc.

Really pay attention to how the composer/arranger handles the transitions between sections to keep the music flowing.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-02-09 08:40:29 Addaverse<br>I think its the timbre not the melody, but lets talk about the equipment used to record these melodies.

Lets focus on richard d james. I think the reason the melodies flow so well is because of the sequencers he uses on his gear. He’s used an sh101 and an mc202 alot and they have a quirky way of sequencing  back patterns (melodies). 

You enter steps in 1 at a time into a digital step sequencer. The number step you are in is displayed on an lcd. It increases sequentially as you press a key on the piano keyboard and then when your finished, plays it back at a steady quarter/eighth/sixteenth, note (normal or dotted). Then you feed the sequencer an external trigger (cv or sampled cv) to progress  the counter 1 step at a time. This leaves him the choice to bash out the rhythm by hand with a sampler, or trigger them with a 2nd x0x (808,909,303) sequencer.

So, to simplify, his keyboard has a built in sequencer that chooses the notes 1 at a time. Then he triggers those steps 1 at a time with a 2nd Drum Machine. (Or bassline machine)

Writing melodies with this technique can be more cerebral and mathematical than writing music on a daw or playing one in by hand. You are programming a melody, rather than feeling one.
Injecting feeling into this I would say is an art.

Next i want to talk about the synth timbre hes playing with on the leads. These he may be recording in by hand via keyboard. They may come from an Sh101 but the technique is manageable with just about any synth.  

There is a “vibrato” on the pitch. Its detuning the voice of the synth very slightly. Ide say between .1 and .2 of a semi tone. This gives the synth a waivering quality, like something recorded onto an old vhs tape. 

Next there is a lowpass filter on the synth, which makes it sound more distant and muddy (it sweeps the highs so its only the lower half of the frequency spectrum your hearing.)

And the final most important trick, is the rate at which the vibrato is moving. Typically the pitch of an oscillator (the synth voice) is modulated by an LFO (a really slow oscillator). The frequency of the LFO determines the rate. This frequency can be mapped to be increased or decreased as it ascends up the keyboard. This technique is called key tracking. 

The result here is a vibrato which speeds up and slows down depending on how high you are on the keyboard. The effect on the listener I would describe as haunting, but beautiful. 

So tldr, I think its the technique and gear these guys use to play, not composition abilities. 

 




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-02-17 07:34:43 Pyrophexx<br>Funk is a rythm driven style. The most core part of a funk band is the Drums and Bass. The bass and drums work together through the use of syncopation. The bass has a lot of staccato playing, even purely percussive dead notes. It can also often endorse the role of a main melody. The drums usually keep the basics of a strong backbeat and add in a lot of ghost notes on the hi-hat or the snare. That gives you the "in the pocket" sound of funk.

For keys, their role is usually harmonic in nature, and often also quite rythmic. Funk, being derived from jazz, likes to use some 7th chords and quite a bit of basic diatonic extensions. The piano left hand can either double the bass or even play counter melodies.

Guitar has a particular style in funk. Like other instruments, it has a focus on rythm. It includes again staccato playing, and lots of syncopation. It often doesn't have the same harmonic role as keys. A typical guitar part could stay on the same note for whole parts of a song and be fine with it. In "I want you back", the guitar only stays on Ab for the whole verse.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-07 23:26:10 mango277<br>Everything.

Analyse the tempo, the swing of notes, the drums, the individual elements of the drums, the panning, the reverb, the spacing, the main melody, the bass, the counter melodies. The movement of the piece, the saturation in the music, the chords.

Without sounding pretentious, analysis can be as simple or as complex as you would like it to be, heck you may be able to analyse the music better than the person who even made the piece. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-09 20:47:40 4plus1<br>Here's a crazy theory: It's both. But not the way you think.

So you have this chord progression:

&gt; Bm - D - F♯m - E

Which works great both as a dorian and an aeolian progression:

&gt; i - ♭III - v - IV (dorian)

&gt; v - ♭VI - i - ♭VII (aeolian)

But compared to something like *'I - IV - V^7 - I'*, it doesn't hit you over the head with a *Perfect authentic cadence* to make sure there's really only one way to hear it. It could go both ways.

Which means that the other elements of the song decide what the tonal center is, by accenting different notes.

The vocal melody is probably the most influential one, but there's also a faint little (counter-?) melody in the background for certain parts of the song.

In the intro and verse, the vocal melody reinforces the notes **F♯** and **A**, by ending phrases on these notes, respectively. The faint melody in the background (only really present in the intro and connecting sections) ends on **F♯**, **C♯**, **A** and **B**.

So, that little reinforcement tips the progression over into *F♯ minor/aeolian*.

The the bridge/pre-chorus arrives and the vocal melody starts to move around, accenting **D**, **F♯**, **A**, **G♯**, until it finally ends on a strong **B** ("...our cups to the  **stars**"). The tonal center gets more ambiguous.

Then the chorus kicks in and **D**, **C♯**, **B** end up being accented. *F♯* isn't even part of the melody anymore. The tonal center is morphing into **B** (which means *B dorian*).

The the second (more repetitive) part of the chorus hits and suddenly the melody is all about that **B**. The other two notes being used are *A* and *C♯*, which draws even more attention to the note between them (*B*).

Now we're in dorian territory. At least until the end of the chorus, then the small connecting section re-introduces the faint guitar melody from before that hints at *F♯*, then the next verse starts, the tonal center shifts back to *F♯* and the cycle continues.

---

At least, that's how I've always heard it. 

In the end, it probably depends on your cultural upbringing, the music you normally listen to and other factors that have nothing to do with the piece of music itself. 










</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-13 17:26:52 mladjiraf<br>Harmony serves as an accompaniment. In non-Western music, you have arpeggios, static drone notes or scale motives instead of chords for the accompaniment, because chords will usually clash dissonantly (especially in oriental music).

Generally, you need only melody for a song.

Secondary melody in the bass, percussive rhythm section, counter melodies and harmonies are just making the music more sophisticated.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-16 04:44:29 smk4813<br>If you're having trouble creating a melody, then sing or hum whatever comes to mind.  You can put lyrics to those *na-na-na's* later if its a song.

If you're having difficulty *developing or extending* the melody, try a few things:

* Switch the melody over to a different instrument.  A new timbre can instigate new ideas.

* Constriction or Elongation.  Stretching out or shortening certain notes or sections can illicit new responses or feelings.

* Transpose or modulate the melody to a new key or shift it to a new mode to create a contrasting section of music.

* Add a complementary counter line to fill space or add emotion.

* Tempo shift down or up suddenly or gradually.

* Metric modulation.  Re-phrase the melody for a new meter like 5/4 or 9/8.

* Play around with what bits of the melody are repeated if any.

* Create a mirror image of the melody by playing it backwards or inverting the intervallic motion. If you went up a major 3rd at point A, try going down a minor 6th instead, you'll get the same note an octave higher or lower than the previous form.  You could also reverse the intervallic motion.  If you went up by a major 2nd at point A, try going down by a major 2nd.

* Don't forget your ornaments or articulations likes vibrato, tremolo, trills, bends, harmonics, glissando, legato, ghost notes, grace notes, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-17 20:15:10 mapmyhike<br>One option will be to use power chords or block chords.  Or, use a pivot chord.  If your melody is C to D and you use C# as a passing tone, you can play your (whatever - C, Dm7, Am, F, etcetera) chord, then a C#dim7 chord to pivot you to the next chord - Dm7?  Diminished chords are great when you don't know what else to do. 

As you know, C#dim7 is the same as Gdim7. Bbdim7 and Edim7.  Depending what your initial chord is and where you are going, you can voice the chord to the corresponding diminished chord to create a counter passing melody within the harmony.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-30 08:39:36 unilateral9999<br>well the answer that always gets me downvotes is that your premise is off because the melody doesn't actually work in those other cultures's music. i'd love to hear a counter-example, but songs with drones are just dicking around in the upper register and they sound like ass.

a more forgiving answer is that western music *does* have a drone, it's just invisible. the drone is aurally implied by the key in the same way that a beat can be implied even if you never hear the downbeat. and so then the melody works in those cultures the same way it works in western. as a thought experiment, you can try listening to a song in C while droning a C and hearing that it still sounds about the same.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-04-07 01:57:34 AndrewT81<br>In this case the melody is in the strings and the counter melody uses a brass section sample for a counter melody. 

Strings are very versatile, but the sound tends to be homogenous, so a lot of different colors in orchestral arrangements come from other instruments interacting with the strings. 

A common way to make a melody softer is to have it played by both strings and flute, or you can make it more adventurous by adding mallets like glockenspiel or vibraphone. 

A common arrangement in rpg soundtracks is to have bass guitar and simple percussion on the bottom, strings in the middle, and a solo instrument like trumpet on top. Some harp arpeggios can be added for that old school final fantasy feel. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-04-22 17:56:36 Jongtr<br>A minor 2nd between B and C is usually not too bad.  A common RH Cmaj7 voicing is G-B-C-E, which would do for Am9 as well. It's when the C is raised by an octave, forming a minor 9th with the B below, that it sounds nasty.  Nasty, that is to (even) jazz ears.

It's also the reason why, if a strong melody note happens to fall on the root of a I or IV chord, the chord is traditionally played as a 6th, not a maj7 - just in case the melody is played an octave higher than the 7th.
  
It's the same reason a perfect 11th is avoided on a Maj7 or dom7 chord - you get the same "avoid note" m9, this time between 3 and 11 - and also why a b13 is avoided (unless the 5th is omitted).  

Obviously you can add an 11th on a dom7 if the 3rd is omitted - giving the common 7sus4 chord - but you still wouldn't add it to a maj7, even if the 3rd was omitted, because of the counter-functional tritone created between maj7 and 11. (C-(E)-G-B-F is a G7 on top of a C, two opposing functions at the same time.)  Hence the jazz solution of raising the F to F#.

The only time a m9 interval is OK is (bizarrely enough) on a 7b9 chord, a typical V in a minor key.

My order is this

 1. Key, not scale or "mode" but key
 2. Some sort of melodic thing
 3. A simple two voice harmony based off it^ if it's simple it's like a cantus firmus, if it's complicated I have to analyse it for important, prominent notes
 4. The cadence
 5. The other voices of the harmony
 6. Counter melodies to the original melody, always based off of the harmony
 7. The song form, mixing and the dynamics of the piece, stuff sorted out in my DAW better discussed in /r/wearethemusicmakers

Just before you criticise, I'm employed as an engineer. Having a highly structured process and still finding a way to be creative is what I'm paid to do. You really, seriously don't need to follow this and probably shouldn't.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-05-11 01:38:40 ttd_76<br>I went to a jam session once when I was just starting to learn jazz.  I wasn't that good, but I knew my chords and simple jazz rhythms well enough to sit in and comp.  I wasn't exactly adding much to the session, but I wasn't dragging people down either.  

Anyway, 3/4 of the way through they give me the nod to take a solo on some easy song because they know I'm not that good.  I'm like shaking my head furiously "No."  But it's too late.  So I start, and I do my best, and it is awful.  Just horrendous, I start off bad, panic half-way through kind of just end it in the middle out of embarrassment.

So afterwards, I asked the other guitar player if he had tips.  It turned out he was a guitar instructor and had an MFA in music so I think this was like his big gimmick/trick he pulled on all his students.  But it worked and finally got me on the road to improvising after many hours of wasted effort.  So here it is.

He said "You suck at improvising."  Just like that, no paraphrasing.  So I was like "Yeah, well I know, but that doesn't really help?"

So then he goes "You suck at IMPROVISING."  Okay, still drawing a blank from me.

So then he pulls out a fakebook and turns it to some jazz standard like Autumn Leaves or something.   He's like "Take a look at this song and tell me how you could approach this."

So, I'm like I got this because I have played this song a million times and I know a bit of chord analysis and theory.  So I diagram out the chords and I'm like "Well, you could play Dorian over here... etc."  I don't get everything right but I think I was mostly right.  But it didn't matter because the dirty trick was he didn't care what I said.

He picks up his guitar, and says "Okay, can you follow what I'm doing?"  And he just starts playing the chord changes as arpeggios.  So yes, it's obvious what he's doing.  Then he starts throwing in a couple of half-step approach notes.  And suddenly he's got a jazz rhythm going.  And then he stops playing straight ascending and descending and starts mixing it up and suddenly he's got a little motif, and a call and response.... but it's basic arpeggio notes the entire time, nothing too fast.  It sounds awesome.

Then he points at me and says "See, you can play this. It's not hard."  And I was like "Yeah, I can pretty much play that or learn to play it if you write it out but no way could I improvise that on the fly."

And then he went into his big reveal:  "The reason you can play this but can't improvise this is because YOU. SUCK. AT. IMPROVISING."  Then he just stared at me with this shit-eating grin, like "ta-da."  I did not give him the punch in the face he so richly deserved because I finally got what he was saying.

The elaborate point here is that improvising is it's own skill.  I was bad at improvising because I had not done it enough.  And the reason I hadn't done it enough was because every time I did it for 30 seconds and sounded terrible I would think it was because I couldn't play fast enough, or didn't know enough theory or chose the wrong mode, etc.  

Music theory and stuff like that is good because it gives you more arrows for your quiver.  But if you can't shoot an arrow, it doesn't matter how many arrows you have.

So when you improvise, don't think about modes and theory.  Work with what you have.  If all you really know is your arpeggios or just the melody or not even that, just go with it.  You already know everything you need to construct a decent (albeit possibly short) solo.  You just suck at improvising.

You can
1)  Take a section of a phrase and transpose it an octave higher.

2)  Take a small phrase and play it in reverse.

3)  Approach a note from a half step above or below.

4)  Alter the phrasing by stretching a note out or shortening one or hitting it a half beat early or late.

5)  Play around with accents, staccato, or legato.

6)  Boil down a melodic line into essential notes, maybe one per measure.  Usually start or end of a phrase, any note that is held on a strong beat, often the first of the measure.  Make sure you hit those exact notes at the right time.  In between, just make something up.  If you play it fast enough and with conviction and showcase the pre-determined showcase notes, it will work...maybe not great, but it will work.

7)  When you are away from your instrument, just hum the melody in your head and play around with it.  Sing it like a lounge singer.   Or a jazz singer and throw in some scatting.  Do a reggae version.  Just play around with all the bits of the melody and rhythm that you can.

That's basically it.  You take a melody and start re-arranging it.  You won't be able to do it on the fly right away.  But just take an hour/day/week and come up with your own version of the song.  Or several versions.  In the course of playing around with it, you'll be developing both your ear and your familiarity with the song.  Until you have enough skill and familiarity that you literally can re-work the song on the fly.  Then you are improvising.  And you don't need to learn any new theory to do it.

Because you play piano, it's going to be even harder for you not to get distracted.  Because you have two hands and potential 10 fingers to enable you to play counter-melodies and re-harms and polyrhythms all sorts of stuff.  

But just stick with the basics of re-arranging the melody line in a simple, but pleasing way and if it sounds mostly like arpeggios or the original line just with two notes changed that's okay.  You suck at improvising because you are just starting.  But just take baby steps and keep plugging away. You get better at improvising by doing it, and not by learning scales or music theory.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-05-11 11:29:34 ttd_76<br>In harmony, there’s always more than one thing going on.

You picked out the sequence of notes that voice leads to the root, which is pretty clever.  That tends to escapes many people.

Thing is, those what about all those other chord tones you are ignoring?  Those notes are playing off each other, too.  So depending on what notes you focus on, you can hear different things.

On a keyboard play that 6-7-8 an octave up while your left hand plays the remaining notes of the chords.  If you have two keyboards or can split it or use piano roll on a DAW or something so you have two completely different tones even better.  Now play the 6-7-8 louder.  And linger on the eight while getting off the harmony in the left hand quick.  It probably doesn’t sound so clash-y and unresolved.

So that’s kind of the non-theory explanation.  You have a set of notes that is resolving pleasantly, but it’s being surrounded by too many other notes that want to go in other directions.  Your mind can’t focus on the good part, and as a result it diesn’t Know what is going on and you feel no resolution.

A resolution is the expected end result of a pattern.  If the pattern that resolves is buried under too much other stuff your brain can’t pick it out.  When you separate that pattern from the other notes by distancing them via loudness, tone, or range then it is easier for your mid to grab that and tune out the rest.

That’s how those re-harmonizing geniuses do it.  They play all sorts of shit that seemingly shouldn’t work but it does because underneath it all there’s a little melody or even counter melodies in the specific chord voicing they choose.  Just enough for your brain to glom onto so the thing sounds weird overall but somehow holds together.  Part of you is confused and part of you is not, and that contradiction/mystery to unravel is what is cool and draws you in.  If you are just 100% confused, then it just sounds like ass.

Now that you know what part of the ii-V-I resolves to your ear and you have played around with the other parts to figure out what isn’t resolving you are on your way to reharmonizing and other tricks.  I don’t know that you want to get too theoretical here.  Just play around and experiment.  Figure out another melodic line that resolves to a note in your last I or IV and play the two melodies against each other as chords.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.  If it works, then don’t worry about harmonic analysis or what seemingly crazy chords you just made.  Just think of it as two melodies and not one harmony.

Listen to the bass line as that almost always contains the root of the chord or at least very strongly implies it.  

Then just try to sing the root of each chord as it goes by and "feel" the progression.  You can use hooktheory.com to supplement your training.  It lets you can enter in a I-IV or I-V progression and they will spit out a list of songs containing that progression.  Listen to a bunch of those songs until you can start to hear it in your head.

For specifically I-V, I-IV or I-IV-V combos, listen to a lot of blues and it will get drummed into your head pretty quick.  A standard 12 bar has both a I-IV and a I-V move in it.

If you're in it for the long game of developing your ear to pick out much trickier chords and counter-melodies within harmonies and things like that, then you will probably have to put some long hours in learning solfege and being able to hear intervals and notes played against the tonic and stuff like that.

But there's no reason not to do both at the same time.  Learn to hear actual or implied basslines and simple chord progressions by listening to the radio and humming along to the chords instead of the melody.  And start on the road to deeper mastery by starting to get into solfege a few minutes a day.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-05-28 07:46:08 LiamGaughan<br>&gt; I would say learn counter point

If you're making electronic/guitar music I wouldn't spend that much time on this to be honest. Not saying it's not important but it's no way near as important as stylistic study of existing songs, which in itself will teach you about counterpoint and how important it is. It can be important for a strong melody over the harmony/bass but in the middle anything can happen, and even then there's loads of popular music with melody as consecutive 5ths or even octaves. Look at the Power Chord. Bach would be rolling in his grave probably, but Black Sabbath's Iron Man and Paranoid seem to have done okay.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-06-04 09:30:16 65TwinReverbRI<br>OK, so "Avoid Parallel" 5ths is further downstream, part of the rules of Voice-Leading that apply not only to Fugues, but to any contrapuntally-based or descended style of harmony writing.

So that's like a rule that says, a Fugue must contain notes!

So, a Fugue, is a Type of Musical Composition that is Polyphonic, and Contrapuntal, uses particular forms of Imitative Counterpoint, and typically has 3 sections, an Exposition, Middle Entries (or Development Section), and a Closing Section (or Recapitulation).

There is a Subject, which is typically the first thing heard, usually unaccompanied, that is a Melody that often contains rather recognizable elements in terms of pitch and rhythm, so that it may easily be identified each time in enters throughout the piece. After the Subject enters, it comes in again in some other voice, in a different Key and is called the Answer.

Traditionally, the Subject begins in the Tonic Key and the Answer will be in the Dominant. There are even things that can be said about Subjects and we have Real and Tonal Answers, and there are certain things that typically happen when the Subject begins on the Dominant Scale Degree for example, that makes the Answer "reply" in a specific way.

Each successive Subject or Answer will enter in either the Tonic or Dominant key respectively, and usually goes T-D-T-D for 4 parts, though sometimes you might get T-D-D-T and so on. If it's only a 3 voice fugue it would be T-D-T.

The material played against the Answer is usually called the Counter-subject especially when it takes on a significant role in the composition (keeps coming back against any future Answers and Subject entries, etc.).

Once the Subjects and Answers have all entered (you'd have 4 things for 4 voices, etc.) then the Exposition is complete. The Exposition itself may do something like have S-A, then an "episode" which might be music based on the Counter-subject, or some part of the Subject, or just new material before the other 2 voices enter, or all 4 voices may just enter back to back with no intervening episodes (and this is why it's hard to make rules because that's variable from work to work - some fugues have episodes in the Exposition, some don't).

Then there may be more episodic material, but you then get a section of "middle entries" where the Subjects and Answers and Counter-subjects - or portions thereof, motives derived from them and so on, are treated "developmentally" usually going through various permutations and keys (you may get the Subject presented in Inversion, and so on). You can also have "False Entries" where it sounds like one is coming in, but doesn't finish.

Then you usually get a statement of the original S-A pairs in the original key, which marks the closing section.

There is often (but not always - see, no rules) a "Stretto" where the Answers come in before the Subject finishes so they're more overlapped than they were initially.

So aside from it being a Polyphonic, Imitative Counterpoint piece with Subjects and Answers in the Tonic and Dominant keys (or pitch levels) respectively, it is comprised of 3 sections with an Exposition, middle entries, and some kind of closing section.

That's about all we can really pin down. The rest of the stuff is variable. It may or may not contain episodes, it may or may not contain Stretti, and so on.

Works that aren't "full fugues" or are just an Exposition etc. are called "Fughetta" or "Fugal Sections" and so on.

Some Fugues have more than one Subject, and these are called Double Fugues (2 subjects) and Triple Fugues (3 subjects). Anything bigger than that is pretty rare.

The wikipedia article actually gives a very nice overview of the form:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue

But none of this goes into things like what harmonies to use, or anything like that. There are certain things about Tonal and Real answers that we can say, but overall, that stuff is up to the composer. And a modern Fugue might very well use Parallel 5ths.

Think of it like a "Novel". It doesn't matter if the book uses some made up language like "A Clockwork Orange" - the definition of "Novel" is the form - you know, paragraphs, chapters, and so on. But what words you use, or language you use, or grammar you use, or even if you make up words - it's still a Novel as long as it meets the definition of a Novel. But Poems, Short Stories, and even "Novellas" and "Novelettes" all use words the same kinds of ways - so those aren't really the definition of a "Novel" per se.

So, IOW, you'd avoid paralle 5ths not becuase you're writing a fugue, but because you're writing in a harmonic style that avoids parallel 5ths, which you're using in the form of a fugue, if that makes sense.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-06-18 10:25:45 jazzintoronto<br>Do you mean improvising a counter line, or improvising chord changes?

I'm going to assume the former. And I'm going to talk about the jazz idiom.

There are a few different ways I think about harmonizing a melody:

Harmonizing with a certain interval, usually 3rds, 6ths, or 4ths. I will go for a certain interval below my note as a default, but will adjust if the note on the bottom doesn't work with the chord.

Harmonizing based on established conventions #1: Red Garland's bells: Harmonize the melody with a perfect 4th and perfect octave below the melody note, up high on the piano in my RH, while playing rootless chord voicings in rhythmic unison in my LH.

Harmonizing based on established conventions #2 Locked hands: Harmonize the melody in octaves, filling in the middle space with chord tones or passing diminished chord tones. There is A LOT MORE to locked hands than this, but that's the TL;DR.

Harmonizing based on established conventions #3 drop 2. Exactly like Locked Hands, but the second note from the top is dropped down by an octave.

Thinking about guide tones and voice leading. ie, C-B is the operating resolution when going from Dm7 to G7, so I'll probably try to have it in my counter line, if it's not already in my line.

Thinking about the 5 different types of motion: 1) parallel (voices both move in the same direction at the same interval) 2) similar (voices move in the same direction but at a different interval) 3) oblique (one voice moves, other voice stays in the same place) 4) contrary (voices move in opposite directions) and 5) stasis (both voices don't move) -- you don't even have to mix all 5 types of motion, but being aware that they exist helps.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-06-29 01:28:20 Joemoe1122<br>I'm not sure that using these intervals would be "incorrect" per se, but most of them probably aren't used because they are counter-intuitive to most instruments (outside of maybe Piano). For example, because you have to add all the extensions (unless you call it a CMajadd30 I guess)  a CMaj30 would consist of something like:

*  C E G B D F A C E G B D F A C D

Obviously, this is way too many notes for even a pianist to play in a single chord. If you take out the redundant notes, you are left with a CMaj13.

*  C E G B D F A

Theoretically, it might sound more full to play all 16 chord tones of a CMaj30, but it doesn't make sense in practice because a CMaj13 already consists of every note in the key of C Major. A lot of people would additionally choose to omit perhaps the 9th and 11th of a CMaj13, because the further you extend a chord, the more likely you are to encounter dissonant intervals. Extending this chord to a CMaj15 would only add an octave to the root, at which point the process of stacking thirds would restart in a new octave if you were to continue building on that chord. This is why we typically don't name chords using intervals past 13.

To respond to your example specifically, a chord made up of A2, C2, E2, and B4 would not be Am16, because Am16 implies that the chord uses each 3rd extension up to the 16th (which would be a 15th in this case). So Am16 would be something like:

*  A C E B D F# A C D

or

* A2 C2 E2 B2 D3 F#3 A3 C3 D4


Again, if we get rid of the redundant notes, you will notice that this is essentially the same as an Am13 chord:

*  A C E G B D F#

In practice, even 13 chords are generally simplified by omitting notes that are less definitive of the chord's sound. (For example, in the Am13, one might omit the 5th or the 11th to make it more playable. (I'm speaking from experience playing guitar, so I can't confidently say the same is true of all instruments). One might also omit the 5th (E) to avoid unwanted dissonance, as the 5th creates a major 2nd over the 13th.)
This practice of omitting certain notes from chord extensions is another reason why something like a 14th or 16th chord is totally unnecessary.

Ultimately, it seems unproductive to even try to name something like (A2, C2, E2, and B4). To me, it seems you would either lower the B4 an octave or 2 (Making the chord either an Amin(add9) or Amin(add2), respectively). I suppose you COULD call it an Amin(add16), but this feels like a situation where that high B4 would be part of the accompanying melody, rather than an extension of a chord, given its melodic distance from the chord tones.

In regard to your question about 14th chords, these typically are not used because of the way we build chords through stacking thirds.  A 14th would already be part of a 7th chord, because it is simply the 7th but one octave higher, whereas the 13th would be a note previously unused in the chord (Unless you're already using a 2nd). Let's look at C Major as an example:

* Cmaj - C E G
* Cmaj7 - C E G B
* Cmaj9 - C E G B D
* Cmaj11 - C E G B D F

* Cmaj13 - C E G B D F A

So, if we were to try and spell out a Cmaj14:

* Cmaj14 - C E G **B** D F A **B**

The "14th" is a B, which is already present as the 7th in the chord, therefore making it redundant. The same is true for 8ths (an octave above the root), 10ths (an octave above the 3rd), and 12ths (An octave above the 5th). Simply put, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths will add tension or color to a chord, but 8ths, 10ths, and 12ths are repeated notes that are typically already played in the lower register of the chord. For example, you wouldn't add a 10th to an A minor chord (in the key of A minor) because that would mean adding a "C" which is already the 3rd of the chord and the note which largely defines the chord as minor. 

Maybe this is different when certain chord tones are omitted? If you were to omit the 5th and replace it with a 12th (the same note but one octave higher), would that make it an add 12 chord? Or would the 12th just function as the 5th, therefore not changing the chord name? I'm leaning towards the latter, but would love to see what others think.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-07-19 04:22:31 LukeSniper<br>Why does it *need* harmony though?

The harmony doesn't establish the tonal center. The melody does. Want proof? Song "Happy Birthday" in C, then "Drunken Sailor" in D. Now try stopping "Happy Birthday" on a D note, or "Drunken Sailor" on a C.

It doesn't work.

The *melody* is unresolved. The harmony just reinforces and supports where the tonic is. It doesn't determine it.

So yes, it *absolutely* is Locrian. Does that "7th" feel like it wants to pull up? No? Okay then. That's it.

The reason Locrian is generally problematic is because trying to add triadic tertial harmony to it destabilizes the tonic. Most Locrian *tunes* are best accompanied by drones, a counter melody, or some sort of sparse accompaniment.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-07-20 03:23:18 65TwinReverbRI<br>Nope.

Much of this has to do with timing and what has essentially become "kitschy" or campy.

I'm not saying the music isn't well written, well played, and well recorded, but their continued popularity has little to do with music theory in any appreciable way.

Let me add this though:

The 2nd album I bought was Abba's Greatest Hits. It was before my music tastes really evolved (towards far less commercial and saccharine music) but that's how popular they were at the time. Plus there were two attractive women and I was the right age - which had just as much to do with their popularity than anything else.

But I've actually come to appreciate the musicality and artistry in the work (not really "theory" per se) and what has happened with me is even when I hear something I don't really care for, I try to look for things in it that interest me or I can appreciate - it could be just crafty lyrics - I just joined a Country band and I don't really like a lot of Country music at all, but at the same time, some of the lyrics are REALLY crafty - I don't even care for the content of the lyrics but approaching it from the "typical listener's" perspective, I can appreciate how crafty even pandering lyrics are. Or there's a great Tele guitar tone, or I really like a production choice, or a crafty arrangement and so on.

Things from ABBA that stick out to me are:

Dancing Queen - Orchestral parts and the gliss that starts it as well as that piano that cuts through.

Take a Chance on Me - "the "take a chance take a chance take a take a chance chance" counter melody/ostinato

Fernando - full of typical clichés but so wonderfully done - the acoustic guitar, the marching snare, the dual vocals after the first verse, then it explodes into this pop song. The backing instruments and arrangement again are just super well done. Perfect vehicle to show off the girls that would really appeal to older audiences at the time as well as contemporaneous audiences.

SOS - similar idea but more "poppy" overall - like a lot of their stuff, the synth work really blends with the orchestral instrument but this one has a really nice set of keyboard work in the intro - more "composed" stuff, which I like, and the synth line that leads to the chorus is great.

Waterloo - great uptempo "rocker" with a great groove and nice horns. Interesting chords in the verse.

Probably my favorite (oh, who I'm a kidding - like many, ABBA is a "guilty pleasure" band for me - the nostalgia of youth, the realization that they actually were pretty damn meritorious and not just pop trash) is 

Does Your Mother Know - I still can't tell if they had a vocoder or something on their voices during the chorus, and the opening synth bass line is just cool.

After ABBA broke up (I think) Frida released a single "I Know There's Something Going On" and I remember this from when it came out (the other ABBA stuff on the Greatest Hits album had all already been released by the time I got to it obviously) and heavy rotation on very early MTV. I only realized recently when I looked it up that Phil Collins produced and played drums. I always liked the song - it was kind of quirky in an odd way - probably that typical Phil Collins drumming - but was definitely an "80s" song and not a "70s" song like the ABBA stuff ( I did know at the time she was from ABBA).

Totally different, and maybe not as "good" as ABBA, but It was catchy - check it out:

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-08-06 11:24:10 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;Is the reason it makes me think of spies purely because of media? 

Yep.

It goes back to the spy craze of the 1960s (also, the Cold War, where there were huge amounts of novels, films, and TV shows dealing with spies).

James Bond would be the primary one. The chord progression idea for the Bond Theme was so popular that Johhny Rivers used it in the pop song "Secret Agent Man" (also written in the same time period, with spy based lyrics) which became the theme song for "Danger Man" which was a British TV show that was ultimately picked up in the US where the name was changed to Secret Agent Man (not sure if Rivers specifically wrote the song for this show or they changed the title for the song and used it for the theme).

Peter Gunn (1958 IIRC) was probably one of the earlier TV shows with a "Private Eye" theme that you've heard many times. But this same kind of sound was common in the Spy films of the 60s.

Mission: Impossible is also lumped in here, with the now iconic 5/4 theme which is still used in the Mission Impossible movies to date - I saw the new one last week and it has some of the exact ideas from the 1960s TV series.

The Man from UNCLE is another one (went through a couple of themes for various seasons, one in  5/4...), I Spy is another. The Avengers in the UK.

That whole jazz band with the bluesy motives became uber common  - even in the Pink Panther films you get a similar kind of sound in many of the cuts (even though it's more Detective/Cat Burglar). Speaking of Criminals, the was one called "It Takes a Thief" starring  Robert Wagner (which is why he was in the Austin Powers movies - same for Michael Caine - he was in many 60s spy/criminal/detective type movies (original Italian Job) and the music for that was also very typical of the time period and similar in style.

But Bond probably had the biggest influence maybe outside of MI.

When I saw The Incredibles (the first one) I noted how much Giacchino captured the whole "spy vibe".

But if you listen to all of the music it's not really all that specific - it would be hard to pull out any single element or mixture of elements specifically related to "spy" music that also isn't found in many other soundtracks (even in the same era).

What happened is, we've seen so many movies, soundtracks, clips, and so on that have that "spy" sound to them - that were used in that context - we automatically associate the two.

Had that music been used for Westerns, we'd say it was westerns music.

One element that was sort of new at the time was adding electric guitar, as heard pretty prominently on the Bond Theme (played by Vic Flick). This was true of other genres at the time too (Spaghetti Westerns) so it's again not a characteristic specific to spy music, but it has been associated with it - so maybe elements that we could say are at least "common" and even "cliches" are the sort of ostinato backing (Peter Gunn, Bond, Pink Panther) with a Brass/Sax melody over it using some bluesy notes and the addition of electric guitar in a melody or counter melody in many.

BTW, the famous film composer John Williams played the piano part on the Peter Gunn theme.

There are pop bands that merge the whole "Surf" and "Spy" genre (some of the Instrumental bands of the 60s like The Shadows had songs called FBI and Man of Mystery (hmmm, Austin Powers again...) and even covered stuff like the Peter Gunn theme. So the two were related and you'll hear people still talk about more recent genres of Instro that are still "Surf/Spy" (things like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits themes inspired bands like The Marketts to do "Out of Limits" and there's also the "Space Age" happening at the same time so lots of space/alien stuff gets mixed in there as well).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-08-09 08:29:13 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;For me it seems like having basically all the awesome ability of a modern DAW inside your own brain. Seems worthwhile to develop. 

I would agree. However, I would caution that it is not an end in itself, just another tool in your toolbox, and I would go so far as to say in some cases, it can run into "party trick" more than useful composition tool.

But since I don't have the greatest hearing skills, who am I to say - probably the reason why I'm not a great composer!

However I'll add this - the most recent piece I wrote, for Trumpet, Trombone, and Piano, I distinctly remember "composing" the opening bars in my head while lying in bed at night, and had to make a mental note so I'd remember it in the morning. But the notes weren't specific - it was a general shape - I knew the two would be in counterpoint, I knew the rhythm I wanted, and the phrasing, but not the specific notes. That came the next day when I entered it in Finale.

A Guitar piece I wrote before that - totally composed on the guitar. Start to finish. Then I just entered it into Finale. It was "messing around" and "hitting an idea" and the right confluence of events and I wrote this little two page prelude in maybe an hour. It took me longer to enter the notes and tidy up the score than it did to compose it. But it was all "writing on the fly". There was no mental hearing other than "I want it to go here next..."

Another piece I wrote for solo Trumpet - totally in the DAW. I think I may have plunked out an opening idea in piano, but really it was written in the DAW.

Now - about the Tr/Tbn/Pno - I had worked out some ideas for note/harmony moves on paper and tried them out at the piano in my office and at home before I had that brainstorm laying in bed. So I had some idea of the "world of sounds" the piece was going to live in.

Also, for all 3, I really make use of the DAW in terms of organizing events - I write in a passage, play it back, and decide where it needs to go next. In the case of the T/T/P piece, which was slightly longer and more involved than the solo pieces, I sketched out 4 or 5 different sections - in fact I distinctly remember writing a section that had this counter melody I "heard" - not the notes, but I felt needed to be there - and I worked it out, but it just didn't sound right. I copied and pasted that section to the end and worked on the piece some more and as it developed I realized it was just too early to have that section there - it ended up later in the piece. So it's like this A section that the first time doesn't have the countermelody, but when it re-appears at the end, it does have the counter melody - which is the "right" place for it for me. So I did "hear" it needed this thing, but it wasn't the place it needed it in if that makes sense.

I'm not saying these pieces are great, or monumental, or boundary-pushing or anything like that. But I'm happy with them. I posted the guitar piece on a guitar forum to get some advice on notation (it's for classical guitar) and one respected member said "it's a bangin' little piece" which made me very happy.

But I didn't really "hear" them in my head. Nor can I really hear all the parts in a Chorale unless I listen to it through 4 times focusing on each part - and still may get the tenor and alto confused if they get too close or cross, etc.

But I can listen to a Rush song and tell you every single thing that's happening and with many pop songs I'll even know the actual pitches, chord formations and so on - because that's where I've spent most of my "ear" time. So certainly familiarity with a genre is going to be a big factor in this - if all you do all day is play 3 part inventions, sure you're going to be able to hear the individual parts better - especially if they're all of a similar style and with predictable elements and other clues to help you out.

Don't forget, Mozart's head probably wasn't full of Jazz, Rock and Roll, New Wave, EDM, non-western musics, Early Music, Atonality, and all this other stuff we've heard. If you had ONLY listened to Haydn growing up and never heard anything else, your abilities to pick out that stuff would probably be much better - especially if you PLAYED it too - and IMHO that's where the real experience comes in.

My colleagues that have these amazing "gifts" - well, they play Piano and have thousands if not 10s of thousands of pieces under their fingers - their experience is far beyond what the "kid with a DAW posting online" is going to be, and they've got thousands of hours on the instrument, playing music, listening to music, trying out things, and so on.

My ear improved DRAMATICALLY when I started gigging regularly in a rock band - because I had to pick up a new song every week. Then I got to the point where I was subbing and learning entire night's worth of music in a week or two. But you also get to try out stuff life, you have to listen more intently to what the other musicians are doing (if you, ahem, lose you place...) and so on. I'm not a real Jazz or Classical guy, and while pop music may be far more simplistic, learning songs by ear has been the main way my ear developed and I was working with a colleague last week on a Trombone Quartet piece (Bach's pieces from the WTC, Inventions, and things written for that ensemble) and I often surprise myself going "no, that's perfect 4th" or "no, there's the note we have to change the pitch of" and "let's gauge the tuning off the octave note right before it" and things like that. I've heard runs with 15 tuplets missing a note. I don't know how, but something just didn't sound "right" to me - often I can't pin point these things, but they're broad strokes - the pianist said, "oh, you've caught my error" and he corrected the passage.

I guess part of it is I'm an audio engineer too, so I tend not only to listen for music, but just sound in general - like I'm more likely to notice spit gurgling in a horn than a slightly out of tune pitch - so they're worried that the pitch is in tune and I"m like "we need another take, clear your spit valve" (which drives them crazy that I can hear that stuff). I did a choral recording where the vocalists were holding this long sustained note but one of them were holding their mouth in such a way that it created this weird "airy overtone" sound. The choral conductor heard the playback and their expertise allowed them to tell the player how to fix it.

So for me, there's more important things than hearing all the notes though I do that pretty well too.
But it's primarily a lot of playing and - well, I always say I don't "hear" things, I "listen" for things or to things if you get the distinction.

Since I don't need to replicate classical music, I don't need to be able to hear it well, other than to correct recording takes (and I typically work from the score anyway - but I can see what it was supposed to be and hear their error a lot of times).

But since I need to do that for pop music, I'm pretty good at it there.

When I compose, it's more broad strokes, and trying ideas - lots of sketching, and then "assembling" and transitioning and things like that.

I actually don't know that good hearing ability would help me because I would tend to fall into the same trap as "composing at the piano" where I'm going to fall back on things I already have heard, rather than trying out sound combinations without any kind of preconceived notions (other that what I might be trying to do in a piece).

HTH

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-08-16 06:58:13 Xenoceratops<br>Whether it is perceptually possible or if there's a sleight of hand involved, the compositional mechanism is still the same: there are multiple lines being expressed in different tonal environments that do not seem to mesh. In Mikrokosmos 70, the keys (F# and D) are related by third, encouraging a tertian justification which would determine that D is the tonic. I would argue that this is really only effective in the last two bars of the piece though: I definitely hear the first 10 measures as an F# melody against a D accompaniment, and then the next 7 measures as a D melody against an F# accompaniment. The two bars after that (with the mezzo forte) begins a merging of the tonalities into a double tonic complex (notice the corresponding motivic elements are now presented in different keys simultaneously so there is no longer a stratification between melody and accompaniment), which is eventually realized as a composite chord at the end.

I'm not saying that [Krumhansl and Schmuckler](http://music.psych.cornell.edu/articles/tonality/PetroushkaChord.pdf) are wrong (and I will have to read the article to comment further on their methodology), but I don't think this view—that simultaneous recognition of multiple tonalities is impossible—accounts for my perceptual experience of polytonal music. As an example, let's take measures 699-721 of Bartók's [String Quartet No. 5, V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du07qCXkNa8&amp;t=30m11s). At 699, I think we can agree that there is one tonal center: A. At 711, the A accompaniment is still going and I recognize the continuity between that part and the preceding 12 measures. However, the melody from before is now transposed up a minor second to B♭. I hear B♭ as a new tonic that is happening at the same time as the A tonic underpinning the other parts. That trilled A at 719 sounds like a leading tone to B♭, not as a tonic in A major. At the same time, I hear the E7 underneath as V7 in the key of A. This was the impression I got the first time I heard this piece, and I was definitely unprepared to hear this passage. (Just listen to the entire movement and you'll hear what I mean.)

---

I am skeptical of music cognition studies. From some literature I've read, it seems the cognition has to catch up to the music. At the very least, I feel the peer review has to be more stringent. (I'm not very deep into music cognition, and the article you reference—and the one I'm about to reference—is from the 1980s, so maybe things have improved.) I find the questions some of these researchers ask, the assumptions they make, the experiments they design, and the conclusions they draw to be problematic. Fred Lerdahl's 1988 article, [Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems](http://www.bussigel.com/lerdahl/pdf/Cognitive%20Constraints%20on%20Compositional%20Systems.pdf), has this to say about perceptual difficulties in 12-tone music:

&gt;Now we are in a position to see why serial organizations are inaccessible to mental representation. Rather than explore the subject through the idiosyncratic serialism of Le Marteau, I will refer to elementary aspects of the Classical 12-tone system, which has been more widely influential. I will give three causes for serialism's cognitive opacity.

&gt;Before proceeding, I must emphasize that the issue is not whether serial pieces are good or bad. As with tonal music, some serial pieces are good and most are bad. Nor am I claiming that listeners infer no structure at all from musical surfaces composed with serial techniques. What listeners in fact infer from such surfaces is an interesting question, one that deserves theory and experiment in its own right. But this is not the issue here. **The issue is why competent listeners do not hear tone rows when they hear serial pieces.**

&gt;The first reason is that serialism is a permutational rather than elaborational system. **Pitch relations in virtually all "natural" compositional grammars are elaborational.** Take for example the pitch sequence B-E-F sharp. It is easy to imagine any number of melodic embellishments internal to the sequence. This typically happens when children sing and performers improvise. Like the syntax of a sentence, musical elaborations can continue recursively to an indefinite level of complexity; for example, sonata form is an expansion of the Classical phrase. This feature enables pitch relations to be described hierarchically by a tree notation.

&gt;**Serialism instead depends on specific orderings of the elements of a set. Distinctions arise from permutations of the elements; for example, the inversion of a 12-tone row has the same 12 pitch classes but in a different order.** The order position of the elements is therefore essential to the identity of individual set forms. **From this it follows that internal elaboration of any element by other elements will undermine a set form.** Consider the row of Schoenberg's Violin Concerto (1936), shown in Figure 8 with order numbers given above. The sequence B-E-F sharp appears at order numbers 3-5. If one wanted to elaborate E, say, with G or with B flat-A, creating the sequences B-E-G-E-F sharp or B-E-B flat-A-E-F sharp, the integrity of the row would be destroyed, since G, B flat, and A have order positions elsewhere in the row. A tone row is not an elaborational structure. (The same point could be made with reference not to elements but to the intervals between elements.)

&gt;**The little research that has been directed towards serialism supports the contention that permutational structures are hard to learn and remember.** Since other human activities are not organized in such a fashion, it is hardly surprising that the issue has in general been ignored by psychologists. The situation reminds me, though, of Chomsky's (1965) observation that many logically possible grammatical constructions never occur, such as forming interrogatives from declaratives by word reversal or by exchange of odd and even words. There is unfortunately no one on whom to test these linguistic counter-examples. Music offers a unique opportunity in this regard. Surely children can be found who have been raised on a steady diet of serial music. Do they identify tone rows? A negative answer will provide strong counter-evidence concerning the structure of musical cognition, and may suggest inherent limitations on cognitive organization in other domains as well.

&gt;Ironically, Schoenberg was much preoccupied with the issue of comprehensibility. I suspect this is one reason why in his 12-tone phase he adopted Classical motivic, phrasal, and formal structures. **As a result, his serial music satisfies the rhythmic Constraints 3-6. But the permutational basis of his pitch organization assures a gap between the compositional and listening grammars.** (Lerdahl 1988, 115-16)

Lerdahl assumes the basic unit of 12-tone music is the tone row and its basic operation the permutation of the row. He assumes listeners must recognize the row and its permutations to make sense of the music, and this is extremely difficult (and therefore a cognitive deficiency of serial music) because it's hard to memorize permutations. He privileges elaborational schemes, in line with a Schenkerian hearing of music. What he fails to perceive is the prominence of smaller set-class motives in 12-tone and serial music. Notes added between that B—E—F# motive may well break serial continuity, but it's easy for a listener to hear G—A—D as the same motive in inversion and transposed. As it happens, much of the pitch structures in 12-tone music operate like this (an observation I tried to encourage in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/93os0b/understanding_twelvetone_music/)).

It's difficult to label rows as they whiz by, but I am confident if you presented me with a recording of all the permutations of a single row (provided it is a row with sensible construction) that I could tell you which ones have invariant hexachords because I am listening for pitch class and set class. When you sit down and analyze 12-tone music (let's assume Schoenberg and Webern, because not all 12-tone systems are the same), what do you find? Composers are concerned with things like hexachords, trichords, invariance, combinatoriality, themes, motives, similarity and difference. None of these guys go in with the aim of presenting 12 randomly selected pitches in order, one after the other, and seeing how much they can invert and retrograde the thing.

Regardless of my view on the structure of 12-tone music, I am doubtful of Lerdahl's overall claims about permutation. I suppose he would say the permutational combinations in [the fugue from Bach's BWV 582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie52xH8V2L4&amp;t=7m46s) (in which the subject is never 'elaborated' upon but always permuted) are difficult to perceive. The prevalence of melodic inversion in old music traditions generally makes me skeptical of Lerdahl's permutational straw man.

---

Back to the question of the perceptibility of multiple tonal centers. I'm wary of somebody telling me that Bartók quartet passage only has one possible tonality, because, ***motherfucker, I hear two pitch centers***. However, I've also been trained to a fairly high degree to listen for tonal centers, just like I've been trained to listen for set classes and permutations of fugal subjects. I don't think I'm typical of the general population in my ability to identify structures in music. I'm not complete either: I presently cannot identify most rhythmic patterns in Latin jazz because, guess what, I haven't been trained in Latin jazz rhythm. If you tell me, "that's a cumbia," I'll just have to take your word for it, because how the hell would I know? Does this mean the cumbia rhythm is imperceptible? Hell no.

Notes for chords and melodies come from  key of Em. Done.

&gt;im writing most of the melody and bass line with the minor pentatonic scale

Which comes from the key of Em. So you're using notes from Em. Done. Except, you're limiting the note choices to a specific set of 5 out of 7 possible note.

&gt;Would I be able to write harmony and counter melody with A min pentatonic or B min pentatonic

What notes are in Am Pent and Bm Pent?

They're all from Em, so yes. Again, these are just 5 note subsets of a 7 note scale - a specific subset. Since these subsets still have only notes from the KEY of Em in them, then yes, they could be used.

But this is not how you should think about music AT ALL.

People get stuck on "pentatonic". They could be 4 note sclaes or 6 note scales, or the whole scale. When you write music in a key, you use notes from the key. Done.

"thinking" "I'll use Am Pentatonic in the key of Em" is just - well, stupid. You want to write in Em, use Em. Em septatonic, hexatonic, pentatonic, tetratonic, tritonic, whatever "scale" it is - it's just notes of Em that you're limitiing for whatever reason.

You *can* successfully use a "limited set" like Am Pent because the notes are still in Em precisely because the notes are in Em. But the idea of using X scale over Y key is to create a specific sound or limit a set of notes to a particular set, not just to use to write chords and what not.


&gt;as following the circle of fifths, or does the circle of fifths not apply the same to the pentatonic scale

Forget the circle of 5ths. This is not what it is, and not what it's used for. I mean, don't forget it, it's important to know. 

But you don't use chords from one key and melodies from another unless you want a particularly specific effect.

Generally speaking, people don't generate harmony exclusively from any Pentatonic Scale even if their melodies and basslines are pentatonic.

99% of the time people are actually just writing in Em, using ALL of the notes of the key for their harmonies, and they may limit a melody or other lines (like a bass line) to pentatonic notes - most often Em pentatonic.

You shouldn't really be mixing scales or worrying about if they're related by the circle of 5ths or not.

It's in Em, use notes from Em. It's really that simple.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-09-04 07:03:04 OzmodiarTheGreat<br>That makes sense. Continued practice will get you there.

I recommend sticking to diatonic notes in your chosen key (that is, no accidentals). Write a melody you like in your key and then write a second half of that melody in a way that harmonizes. Stick to 3rds, 6ths, 5ths, and octaves (in that order). If your main melody is leaping at a moment, try to stick to stepwise motion in the counter melody. Avoid parallel fifths and strongly avoid parallel octaves.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-09-05 13:37:11 oddrocketmusic<br>Melodies are an interesting thing. The thing I really dig about songs are the two melodies made by the bass line and the top melody. The relationship between those notes is what makes the tune in my opinion. A nice tune will have a melody and a bass line that compliment each other. Neither takes prominence other the other. This is something that you can hear in Bach, Parker and the Beatles. Nice voice leading and counter point.

I suggest you try studying these guys to see how they make their melodies. One thing that can help is realising where each note in a scale resolves to. In Ionian (the natural major) The 6 resolves to the 5. The 4 to the 3. 2 to 1 and 7 to 8. You can try using these resolutions as a basis for your melody. Try the same exercise with different modes and scales too. You will start to see where the voices go and how the harmony works itself out. 

Fascinating stuff. DM me if you have any questions. I love talking about all this.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-09-06 13:19:35 bloodhawk713<br>Dynamic markings are always relative and always contextual. They aren't objective measurements. A forte in one piece might be the equivalent of a pianissimo in another. You need to think less in terms of volume and more in terms of colour and function. How are each of the parts in this piece functioning? Who's the bassline? Who's setting the rhythm? Where's the melody? The counter melody? What chord is being played? Not every note in any given chord is equal. If you're playing a dominant seventh chord for instance, the root and the 5th are not as important as the 3rd or the 7th, so you might want the 3rd and the 7th to be more audible.

Dynamic markings are vague because they're only suggestions. That doesn't mean if you see a *p* you can blast as loud as you want, but a *p* doesn't necessarily mean quiet. Like one of my clarinet teachers used to say "*p* doesn't mean piano, it means powerful."

So to answer your original question--Are dynamic markings equal between different parts?--the answer is no, almost certainly not. In your example, without even hearing the piece, if you have only one flute and 16 violins, the first thing I would assume is that the flute is the soloist, which automatically means that regardless of dynamic markings, the flute is probably the most important part and should always be clearly audible.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-09-22 03:50:30 65TwinReverbRI<br>It's impossible to answer.

I mean really, the answer to your question is, listen to other music and figure out what they did and copy it.

You've got a Melody.

You could do hundreds of things with it. It all depends on the effect you want - which you learn from listening to other music and copying it.

ANY instrument could go with it. You could double the melody, you could make a counter-melody, you could have counterpoint, you could have rhythmic instruments, you could have sound effects, you could have chords, and so on. Each one is going to have a different effect.

In fact, many times, people will take a melody like this and just try it many different ways to see what kind of effects they can generate, and then decide on one or a couple of them to use in a piece. So there's no "right" way to do this, and the only "wrong" way to do it is to create something ineffective (like something that's light, happy, and bouncy in a death scene or something, which might not be appropriate).

And you should always remember that sometimes, a statement like this can stand on its own and doesn't even need anything else.

It all depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-21 21:27:29 The_Original_Gronkie<br>I've played a lot of big band trombone, and the trombone works well for a lot of things. First of all remember that it is another color in your palette. The trumpets are brash and brassy, the saxes are similar but with a smoother tone, and the trombones are velvety and smokey. 

Saxophones tend to have the entire range covered, from low to high, just by using a combination of alto and tenor. In the same way, you can look at the trombones as the lower extension of the brass section. The trumpets tend to play up high, while the trombones play in the lower registers. So often they are doing what the trumpets are doing, when the trumpets aren't playing the melody. 

Other times they can be playing with the tenor saxes to give some solid weight to the arrangement. Otherwise it would only be the tenor saxes grounding everything, while the altos and trumpets were blasting away up top. That's especially important when the whole band is playing those big harmonized organ chords, when the trombones can double the tenors, and even play the super low notes the tenors can't reach, allowing those chords to reach deep.

In slower arrangements they are good for laying down long sustained notes for a harmonized bed for the melody and countermelody to play above. In slow and medium tempo songs they can play the melody. In faster songs they can play harmonized blasts, adding the tenor and bass parts to the alto and soprano parts in the trumpets and saxes.

They are also good for playing counter melodies in lower and medium registers.

They can also be good for occasionally handling the lead solo melody, especially on mid tempo songs, or songs with a more lyrical melody, giving your audience an aural rest from constant trumpet or sax leads, and giving your set list some variety of color. Think of them like a singer in the baritone or tenor range. Trombone players train to be able to play that lyrical stuff. Ask ANY trombone player about Rochut Etudes, he'll know what you're talking about.

The downside is that the trombone does not lend itself well to improvised solos. The arrangement of notes on the slide doesn't tend to work well for linear improvising, as the instrument tends to emphasize the harmonic overtone structure instead of scales. Occasionally I'll hear a trombonist that has figured put how to improvise around harmonic overtones rather than scales, but most aren't very good at it, unfortunately. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-23 06:47:38 65TwinReverbRI<br>u/billybrowntrombone, trying to cut through the noise here :-)

So, Classical Music - which is likely what you're studying in Theory, is different from a lot of other styles. There are many styles that are either descending from this "CPP" music (Common Practice Period) and certainly some of those elements are still in use in many styles and may even be prevalent.

But, to explain maybe a little more deeply:

The progression "up a 4th" or "Root Movement of a 4th" is considered the strongest Functional progression because it allows the Dominant to resolve to the Tonic. It also very quickly helps us establish keys because it makes unique progressions that can't be duplicated in other keys, so things like ii - V, and vi - ii also exhibit this property.

However, maybe a better way to say it (and the way it is often said) is to refer to those functions - Tonic, Dominant, and Subdominant (or Pre-Dominant, or Dominant Prep, etc.) and then authors don't agree on the others, but one word is "Mediant" or another is "Variable".

What CPP music does is use Functional Harmony to imply and establish a Tonal Center (Key) through use of SD to D to T progressions. This could be ii - V - I (and frequently is).

ii could be replaced by IV, and V could be replaced by vii^o (and notice IV to vii^o is also root movement of a 4th).

But, IV - V - I also does well to establish tonality and is functional - being SD-D-T, but one of them is not a 4ths progression.

Secondary Dominant chords are actually also the same as a V(7) - I resolution, and thus a 4ths progression too. But, Secondary Leading Tone chords can be (and often are) used similarly.

N6 goes to V - which some people see N as a modified II, but others see it as a special type of chord.

So we could say that the Cycle of 4ths progressions are part of the structural underpinning of Functional Progression and Tonal Harmony, but, in that they exhibit the SD-D-T functional progression, not "Just" that they're a 4th apart (because as we can see, there are other possible moves with similar function).

iii is actually a very rare chord in Major keys. If you were to tally up the number of chords in every piece during the CPP, you'd probably see I, or maybe even V(7) at the top of the list. ii and maybe IV, then vi and vii^o are probably next. iii would be way down on the list. In fact, you'll probably see more Neapolitans and way more Secondary chords before you see a iii! In fact, you're probably even more likely to modulate to a new key and use a bunch of non-iii chords in that key before you'll see a iii in the primary key !!!

I have my book of Bach Chorales here and the progression for the first one goes:

I - I - IV - V - I - I - V - vi - IV - vii^o - I - V

So, my point to you in my original response is, look at this. It's not your typical pop music - I - V - vi - IV progression. There's one in there, but it's not a 4 chord loop like so much pop music. It's not just slamming a 7th, 9th, or alteration on there to make it "more interesting" or "more unique" and so on. It doesn't even have any significant Cycle progressions - IV to vii^o is one. So is V to I. I to IV is not usually considered one because I is treated specially, but it's not a iii going to vi, and a vi going to ii and so on.

Where the "interest" comes in - and this is part of my original point - is which chords are used when and how they work with the melody, and which chords are inverted (for example the first IV and V are which is different from root position) and so on.

So it's more about making the harmony serve the melody, and in doing so, creating interest and variety through inversion and chord choice (also, in Chorale, there's the addition of non-chord tones, though rhythm is pretty straightforward in that style).

But, there is also a general move and smaller moves from SD-D-T.

T - T - **SD - D - T** - T - *D - fake tonic* - **SD - D - T** and this ends on a half cadence to set up the next phrase.

There are types of analysis which also reduce phrases like this to show a more basic structure, where the first part is all sort of an elaboration of the Tonic function (the IV and V being weak because they're inverted) and the "real" move being IV - vii^o - I and so on (I'm not saying that's exactly what it is here, but that's how it often works) which is a "deeper level - SD - D - T move.

So actually, that kind of analysis is used in "more complex" pieces that don't follow the more obvious path or where function is more obscured. But generally, we like to talk about it in terms of function rather than specific chord numerals all the time.
____

Now, popular music is different and is even more likely to not only not use any Cycle of 4ths progressions, but not use functional harmony either - some are "anti-functional" on purpose, or do what we call a "retrogression", which is going "backwards" - DOWN a 4th instead of up a 4th! So it's like going - T - D - SD - T for your pieces - the wrong way! But we accept it because we like the way it sounds too.

_____


I keep saying "4ths" and "Cycle" because really, the "Circle of 5ths" isn't at all about progressions. It's about Keys. Period. But obviously because it's organized in 5ths many people make the connection. I prefer "Cycle of 4ths" or just "Root Movement of a 4th" because it ties in with what you use for voice-leading principles and so on. But some people don't care to make such a distinction.

____

And finally, I was just trying intentionally throw you some curveballs to get you to think about this stuff - too bad others reacted so counter, but it's a very common problem we see - people trying to make chord progressions "more hip" or "more complex" and so on. There can certainly be reasons to do so, but if you think about it, a common Jazz misconception is to just put say an alteration or higher extension on the chords. But the problem is, that becomes a cliche itself and then isn't really any more complex.

It's more about what chord you use when - or when you don't. Sometimes a well placed triad in the middle of some 7th chords, or a well placed secondary in the middle of a diatonic progression, can say far more than just making a string of secondaries (in a "circle of 5ths progression"!) That's fine in a sequence on as part of a development section or something, but it can seem over-bearing and tend to wander or have *too much** direction/thrust in a phrase - sometimes, composers just want it to be all about I, or all about I and V, and so on.

So don't get too caught up in always trying to make the progression the main focus of a piece. It's OK for it to be "boring" if your melody makes up for it. It's even better to learn to use inversions creatively (which most pop music doesn't even touch on).

These are the kinds of things you're likely studying in theory class - but sometimes it's a little hard to see the forest for the trees. So take a step back, look at the forest, the trees, the leaves, the limbs, the roots, and everything because music is really about the big picture and overall effect of the piece - sometimes it could be a forest, but sometimes it could just be a single giant old oak tree in a pasture that's so beautiful on its own.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-25 22:42:19 ttd_76<br>Think about melodic lines, both in how you choose to voice the chords and the melody itself.

There are some chords with non-diatonic extensions or maybe tritones that are just naturally kind of filled with tension/suspense.  The classic movie villain diminished 7th might be a good example.  A lot of them are sort of jazzy though, and you don't hear them as much in pop music.

There's all kinds of tension in music.  People get hung up on chords and harmony, but IMO, most of the tension-release comes from either rhythm, melody, the texture/tone of the instrument (especially with synths) and other dynamics.  Things like that.

Ascending lines along repeated notes or ascending phrases are pretty common in pop music. I think it works on two levels.  One is that the ascending phrases themselves usually contain some tension.  The other is that those ascending phrases are repeated in an ascending manner to create more tension.  And the third is that we hear the repeated pattern and we want something to break it.  The effect is kind of like the listener can hear you steadily running away from the root and wants it to resolve.  

If the melody you have is naturally building tension (which most melodies should be, at least at some or most points), then you just voice your chords to follow the contour of the melody.  You sometimes can take a hint from the bassline, because the bass player is often doing what you're trying to do which is echo the feeling and movement of the melody.

 Use inversions if you can to capture the key notes.  Otherwise, you may want to consider passing tones/chords.  The melody is doing the work, but you're just sort of echoing/amplifying/highlighting what's already there.  But basically, don't think in chords/harmony.  Think notes and melody.  The chords in pop songs usually are pretty vanilla and don't have any tension in and of themselves.  It's the movement between chords that creates the tension.  And that tension is the result of notes moving in time aka melody.  Somewhere amongst the individual notes buried in those chords, there's a melodic line happening.  Often more than one.  Create a melodic line in the harmony that captures what is happening in the vocal melody.

If you want more tension, you can run a line counter to the vocal melody.  When the melody and harmony seem to be doing different things or moving in opposite directions, that's tension.  Then for even more tension, you can throw in non-diatonic notes and/or extensions and/or substitutions.  But at some point it starts getting dissonant or just too chaotic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now to answer your question (all of this is just my opinion):**

1. have you thought about counterpoint, and have you thought about your themes? The greats of any era have been a master of two things; making beautiful melodies, and making it interesting by expanding and changing those melodies.  You have great themes that certainly evoke the emotions you were talking about, but they are repeated maybe once and they don't change. Especially in the intro it feels like a bunch of separate ideas.  That first idea with the violin could start again after that eight note and be displaced over top of your piano thing.  That's where counter point comes in: I don't think that I would analyze your piece harmonically, so all of the tension and release is dictated by your melodic line.  Looking at how those separate lines would interact and sound together and how they would imply the harmony that you're thinking of and could bring out those ideas. 
2. I think your rhythm is cool.  It has a certain pulse to it, so you don't have to make it anymore interesting, as long as the effect you're going for is this continuing thread kind of thing (that's just my interpretation haha) The only thing is that every time you transition it is very obvious.  I wouldn't just put a bar of 4 between sections, but rather find a way to connect them without stopping the pulse that you've created, so that it sits and feels like a complete work.  
3. I think the biggest thing that might be holding your piece back is that you assign a new scale and chord to all your ideas.  Again just my opinion, but I'm saying your piece doesn't sound tonal or modal, it just sounds like itself, and I think that's a good thing. So you won't get it to fit into those categories.  I would just use your ear more to find out what it needs.  And that will actually change your piece too! Is is your intention to outline Bmaj7-G#sus4-Fsus4-G#sus4-Bmaj7-C#diminshed-Bmaj7-G#sus4 in the violin intro? Because to me, I just like the beautiful and simple melody every three notes: A# G# F, and everything else sounds like support.  You could exploit that, take that three note motif and expand it or contract it, and tbh none if it has to make sense. The whole thing sounds like B lydian except for a little part of it.  

Hope that helps, and good luck!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-07 23:02:11 The_Original_Gronkie<br>I honestly dont think you can approach orchestration from the technical/ scientific perspective that you're talking about. There are a few acoustic principles that come into play, but mostly orchestration is an art, and composers have shown a range of competence with it.

The acoustic principles I mentioned mostly have to with high tones cutting through the orchestral "noise" better than low tones. For instance, in a marching band, one piccolo can easily heard playing the melody over the muddle of a dozen tubas. A marching band orchestrator will quickly learn that you cant give the massed tubas a melody, because nobody will hear it. It will just come out as one low toned mush. But that piccolo cuts right through it. That's why marching bands often include glockenspeils to play the tune - their super high pitch cuts through everything. 

There is something to be said for waveforms, which I am not that familiar with. Brass instruments like trumpets and trombones can cut through a marching band far better than their woodwind equivalents like clarinets and saxophones. They have a sharper tone that allows that.

But that's marching band orchestration, which is the musical equivalent of murdering someone by bashing their head in with a rock. An orchestra is far more subtle. Occasionally those acoustic principles come into play. For instance, a single solo violin can be heard over an entire section of violins. The mass of violins produces numerous separate wave forms that are all slightly different, and the combination tends to cancel out some of the volume, allowing a solo violin playing a different melody to be easily heard above them. Mendelssohn solved the problem in his Violin Concerto by having the solo violin play primarily in upper registers while the ensemble played in middle and lower registers, and as we already heard, those high pitches cut through better.

There are also some limitations from the instruments themselves. You can't expect an entire trombone section to cleanly navigate a 16th note Allegro passage in unison, for example. The use of the slide is too limiting. Instruments have their high and especially low range limits due to the physics and acoustical properties of their construction.

Beyond those simple principles, orchestration becomes an art. How do you know to put the melody in the strings rather than the woodwinds or the brass? It depends on how the orchestrator hears it. He can use some of those principles - the trombones and low strings playing sustained chords on the bottom, while violins play a florid melody on the top, and the woodwinds play a counter melody in the middle. In the meantime, the trumpets and horns bide their time for a while waiting to blast the big glorious ending.

Orchestrators also learn through experience and study which instruments combine well. There are often melodies in the violin section, but often a composer will strengthen it  by adding woodwinds. What does it sound like when he doubles the violin melody with the flute section? How about the oboe section? How about the clarinet section? Each of those instruments adds a subtle variation to the sound of the violin section alone. A good orchestrator learns those differences and uses them to add variety and depth to their work.

Not all composers were great orchestrators, and not all orchestrators were great composers. Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition was composed for solo piano, and Mussorgsky never got around to orchestrating it before he died. Ravel did a stunning orchestration of it that is the most famous version, but others have tried as well. Another great version is Rimsky-Korsakov's, a fine composer and brilliant orchestrator, whose book on orchestration is still one of the basic foundations of the art. As fine a composer as Gershwin was, he knew his strength was as a pianist, so his works were orchestrated by Ferde Grofe, who was absolutely brilliant at it. Much of the love for Gershwin is due to Grofe's colorful and imaginative  orchestrations. 

The bottom line is that you will never be able to orchestrate based on science, wave forms, physics, acoustics, etc. Ultimately it is an art and a skill, and it takes study, practice, and experimentation to learn how to do it. The thing that helped me the most in the beginning was listening to a lot of music with the score in my lap, and committing to memory the sounds of instrumental combinations the way great composers wrote them. You will quickly see wildly different orchestrational  approaches between Bach and Mozart and Beethoven and Mahler and Debussy and Stravinsky, etc., but as different as they all are, it all works, and their orchestrations are as defining of the particular "sound" of each composer as the music itself. It is an imprecise method, but that's the way art usually is.

You should be using the melodic minor scale (or jazz minor) or Harmonic minor. 

Melodic minor: Take your major scale, and simply lower the 3rd ascending and lower the 7th and the 6th And 3rd descending  

A-B-C(natural)-D- E-F#-G#A 
A-G(natural)-F(natural)-E-D-C(natural)-B-A

Jazz Minor: take your major scale, lower the third and play that both ascending and descending. 

Harmonic minor: you take your major scale and lower the 3rd and the 6th. 
 
A-B-C(natural)-D-E-F(natural)-G#-A

These scales are different than there major counter parts.  The jazz minor or harmonic minor scale is what you would be using while improvising on a minor tonic chord.  

It is from these scales that  you get your E7 from.  Or in harmonic minor E7(b9). And note, both of these scales have 7 modes associated with them like the Major scale does.

&amp;#x200B;

\- get away from looping your melody to death, make sure your melody is long enough to be more than a hook and short enough that it doesn't meander. Good melodies are balanced with complementing phrases that make sense

&amp;#x200B;

\-contour! Think about the overall shape of the melody you want and what sort of emotion you want to convey. Contour is key in constructing emotion

&amp;#x200B;

\- learn about balanced phrases (antecedent and consequent; look this up). Tracks often have more than one melody, or even more than one melody happening at once, look int complementary phrasing and counter melodies - maybe even some contrapuntal stuff

&amp;#x200B;

\- this is simple, but learn from music you like. look at some of your favourite melodies and learn to play them and what makes them enjoyable or emotional to YOU!

&amp;#x200B;

It really depends on what kind of music you want to make but I know when I sit down to write a beat I'll start with chords or drums, then from there I can usually fiddle around and find a melody. Even if with a piano you're not the most skilled, try and hum or sing it. Just listen to where your ear wants to go, if you listen to enough music some things will start to sound good and others bad but you will be able to tell.  DOnt give up on the beat making it takes a while for the pieces to fall into to place.

&amp;#x200B;

And as for what makes music, "Music" - well thats completely up to the individual
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-12 21:35:56 65TwinReverbRI<br>Generally speaking, the way composers of tonal music do it is that melody and harmony are conceived of together. IOW, once they start noodling with a melody, they know what Key it's in, and what kind of potential harmonies could accompany it and so on.

Then what they do is decide what kind of texture to set the melody in - contrapuntal - where it's more linear - additional lines (counter melodies) or homophonic - where it's more vertical (melody with chordal accompaniment).

A melody could be accompanied by an infinite number of ideas, so there's no correct answer here. Think of it like a character in a setting. "Bob" is "at his office" or "driving down the freeway" or "fishing for the weekend" - each setting would be different, but the character is still recognizably the same.

Maybe he's an "office drone" and the accompaniment there would simply be low long notes that don't do much. Then in traffic, maybe it's fast paced - other cars zipping by, bobbing and weaving through lane changes and exists - you might see this as counterpoint - with multiple countermelodies zipping along. Then fishing by the brook - might be sort of a combination of the two - harmonies created by countermelodies that themselves aren't attention getting, but together form a nice harmonic backdrop like undulating water.

So you figure out the "general harmony" and then add ideas to support that - but, as you compose, you shouldn't lock yourself into just one option.

In fact, one of the best things you can do for yourself is to take "Bob" and put him in a bunch of different settings - take your melody and harmonize it a number of ways and in a number of textures - because often in music "characters" re-appear throughout a composition in different attire, in different settings, with different emotions, and so on.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-16 09:31:49 65TwinReverbRI<br>Parallel means when two voices/parts move the same direction by the same amount.

It could also mean when an interval played on a single chordal instrument does the same.

If a Soprano singer sings an E, then moves down to D, and an Alto singer sings an A below the E, and then moves at the same time down to G so you get the following:

E - D

A - G

You have an example of Parallel 5ths.

In this case, the distance between A and E is a PERFECT 5th and so is G to D so we may sometimes say "Parallel Perfect 5ths" but the word "Parallel" implies they would both be the same type of interval (Perfect 5ths in this case).

"Parallel" motion also implies SIMILAR direction, so this:

E - E

A - A

is not considered "Parallel" because there's no "motion" at all - it just repeats.

But, if both notes go up, or down, by the same amount, then the distance between them will also remain the same, so it's both Similar motion (they're both going up, or both going down) and because it's the same amount, it's more specifically Parallel motion.
_________

There is nothing wrong with Parallel 5ths. However in some styles they were not used. If you were trying to emulate such a style authentically you would also want to avoid Parallel 5ths. 

However, there are many styles that embrace them - Parallel Organum from the Middle Ages, Planing in Impressionism (Debussy and composers like that) and they are part and parcel of Modern Electric Guitar technique and ubiquitous in pop music and especially hard rock/metal guitar where entire progressions are made up of Parallel Perfect 5ths (Power Chords).

_____

Other intervals can be parallel as well, and the word is sometimes kind of loosely used - for example, we'll often say "parallel 6ths" or "parallel 3rds" which really should be called "consecutive" intervals in similar motion as "parallel" implies it would be MAJOR 3rd to MAJOR 3rd specifically - but when you play 3 or more 3rds or 6ths in similar motion in a song in a key for example, you'll usually get a mixture of major and minor 3rds and 6ths - so while they may not technically be parallel, we still use the word.

The prohibition against Parallel 5ths is largely part of Counterpoint arising in the Renaissance Period and then continues into the Common Practice Period which includes the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic Periods.

In Counterpoint, the main idea is for each part or voice (like the melody each singer would sing) would harmonize together but more importantly, maintain a sense of individuality - one way to do that was to move voices "counter" to each other - contrary motion. But constant contrary motion gets boring (and is impossible in 3 or more parts) so similar motion was allowed, but under more strict guidlines - because when voices move in similar, their independence is weakened - it sounds like one voice is "following along" with the other, or becoming dependent on it. If they move in consecutive motion, it's even more so, and when they move in Parallel motion, so much so that they totally lose their independence. Parallel 8ves are especially bad because it sounds like one part just drops out and the harmony goes away and so on. Parallel 5ths are not much better - they remain a little more harmonic but still stick out like a sore thumb and don't sound very contrapuntal. There was no prohibition against 3rds or 6ths because again, even when consecutive they don't usually stay parallel more than a couple of moves so they don't lessen the harmony or independence as much.

So during the time period mentioned above, composers didn't use Parallel Perfect 5ths (or 8ves) between any pair of parts/voices (or when something similar happened on a chordal instrument) in Contrapuntal textures (4-Part Chorale style writing for example) so if you want to write in that style, you shouldn't use them either!

But, if you're playing modern pop music, there's nothing wrong with them. If you're playing metal, you BETTER use them!!!!

______

And just to be clear, Parallel motion happens between a PAIR of parts/voices - the vertical (harmonic) interval of a 5th say between a Flute and Oboe, or an Alto and Tenor, or between two Violins playing in counterpoint, or the melody and bass line on a keyboard instrument, moving to another 5th distributed the same way.

It has nothing to do with a note in a melody, moving to the next note in a melody - that's just called a melodic interval and moving from an A note up 5th to an E note is NOT parallel 5ths - just a melodic interval of a 5th.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-28 18:25:31 Woochia<br>Just a few ideas, hoping it helps:

- think the music in succession of tension and resolution, full and empty. Sometimes you want a part that sounds more "empty", more intimate to then have it full again. If you want a big "boom" in your music, it's better to remove elements before than adding too much after.

- if you want to add variation without removing the melody or the counter melody, try playing them with shorter notes so it's more discrete. Or try to play them on totally different instruments  (you can them layer them for the end, where you want the big "boom")

- try to make counter melodies that are not the same length than the main melody. This can sound odd, but it can add a nice motion (like maybe just a counter melody on 3 notes that loop). As the 2 melodies would have their own feels, you could use one, the other or both more easily maybe
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-28 21:54:56 SergeantPepr<br>Ok, so you're calling the repeating notes from the start the melody, and that whistle the counter-melody? That's a big part of the problem; the whistle actually is the melody, and there is no "counter-melody".

Those repeating notes are actually just a "riff", or even an "ostinato" (basically a fancier name for riff anyway). A riff is not the same as a melody. Think about a rock song, we'll use Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden as an example cuz thats what popped in my head first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbBbFH9fAg

Listen to the guitar arpeggiating chords, much like your riff it is providing a texture to the music, but it is not actually a melody. The melody is in the vocals, and there is no counter-melody (maybe when he sings partially over the guitar solo, that could be considered 2 melodies, but certainly not the main riff).

&gt;so i put in a counter melody which is the high pitched whistle, then.. when i pull it out.. the track sounds like it goes "flat" like it loses the contour of the counter melody and it sounds "missing" rather than it pulling out very easily and smoothly where it still sounds like the track is going fine.. What am i doing wrong?

Basically everything except that whistle is just simply texture for the overall beat. The whistle is the only actual melody, and so it sounds flat and empty without it because it is. Have a go at writing a melody that directly compliments the whistle, THAT will be your counter-melody that you can add in the second half of the song/whenever you want too. That melody will be the one that sounds really good, but will not hurt the music if you remove it. (Actually, the whistle would likely be the real counter, because it is a very bare melody, try to write a more active melody to counter it, and then keep the whistle as the counter-melody instead)

&gt;Specifically when it comes to hip hop beats there is a fair deal of counterpoint

Can you provide examples? I think what you are calling counterpoint is likely just the way basslines go with melody lines in hip hop? Basically basslines, riffs, and chords are *not* melodies, even if they are presented like one (i.e. single note riffs or bass lines). 

&gt; again the issue of no part being "Dependent" on any other to work..

You're on the right path, but this is a slight mistake in thinking. Although the melody line should be independent of everything else, everything else does need to serve the melody. The melody is quite genuinely the *most important part* of a song. And can often be what separates a "beat" from a "song".

But your music sounds chill, work on your melodies and you will sound really good.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-02 07:17:17 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt; For examples, we were shown several songs, from Tubthumping to Call Me Maybe to Rolling in the Deep. Again, the focus is explicitly pop, even if music theory usually tends to use classical pieces.

Do you remember which  or which parts were given as examples of Polyphonic texture?

Look I agree with the other poster as well, and your general response - yes there are sections, and yes there are "subsections" of things (like just a particular instrumentation) that are "Polyphonic within an overall Homophonic texture". So things like that, or like "Quasi Polyphonic" would be viable ways to discuss what you're saying.

Good luck on the project - and thanks for clarifying the parameters - you have to understand so many people come on here with what my assumptions were - so sorry to assume, but it's the nature of these forums.

I think you obviously write well enough that you'll be able to argue any points well, or make cases for things that are "hybrid" kind of elements.

I did listen to the section you mentioned though, and I didn't really feel like it qualified at least in total as Polyphonic texture. More like "counter melody".

But again, your examples in class could have been similar and in that case it would make absolute sense to discuss them this way.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-17 22:48:05 65TwinReverbRI<br>Not sure what you're asking.

"A Capella" in the strictest sense means vocals only - unaccompanied by instruments.

It's not a "form". It's like an "instrumental" is a piece for instruments only with no vocals.

Pretty much all A Capella works are going to have multiple lyrics.

There aren't really terms for if people are singing different lyrics at the same time - like in "Silly Love Songs" by Paul McCartney and Wings, there's a break where each voice is singing a different lyric line. There's no real word for that. It's just "counter melody" with different lyrics.

There's also the "Motet" which comes from the French word for word - "mot" - because "words" were used in the piece - and in fact, a lot of times the words were from different languages sung simultaneously! Probably not what you're after though.

There is a thing called "Hocket" which is a compositional technique where a single melody is divided up among multiple singers often with each singer just singing one word on one note, with another singer taking the next word on a different note. A lot of "Fa La La" type passages (but not the famous Christmas one) are done like this in Medieval music.

It might be worth checking out to give you some ideas:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocket

That page links to Motet too, types of pieces which commonly employed Hocket.

The resource is all the pieces that do it - figure out what they do, and try to copy it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-20 07:08:01 Tausami<br>I wouldn't worry about it too much. The harmony is just a process, and getting caught up with creating perfect processes is a classic beginner composer's mistake. The goal of composition is to make music that sounds good, so just trust your ear. If it sounds good to you, it's the correct solution. You'll get a feel for how to accommodate melody, counter-melody, and harmony. You just need to do it a bunch.

A lot of the other responses to this thread are just being pedantic. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-24 07:12:19 65TwinReverbRI<br>Still homophony.

Homophony can still be contrapuntal in origin, but it's something where one part (the melody) is "more important" than the rest. The counter melody is still generally considered "not the main melody" so it still falls under the definition of homophony. Even in "melody with accompaniment" music, the "accompaniment" can still be comprised of lines and "melodic elements".

It's probably easiest to reserve Polyphonic to more specifically Polyphonic Counterpoint, like a Fugue, or obviously contrapuntal section etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-01-06 16:53:57 BanjoCAB<br>in addition there can be a midground; something that doesn't have your full attention but is also not totally unchanging that it becomes part of the background (perhaps fills, or a counter melody?).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-01-15 23:31:36 ferniecanto<br>It's hard to understand your problem, maybe because you've been led to think music must be made in one specific way, which is counter-intuitive to you. For example, I don't think your problem is with chord progressions at all. It seems to have a problem with *form*. And yes, of course chords are an important aspect of form, but it's not the only one.

Second, by "columns", I don't know if you mean measures, or beats. I.e. I don't know if your melody lasts for seven measures, or if it's in a 7/4 meter. But still, neither of those is "weird". Writing phrases in groupings of 4 or 8 is a convention, but not a law. If it sounds nice to you, that's what matters. That's the ultimate goal of making music.

Third, I don't understand the issue with connecting two long notes together. Does that make it unplayable on the violin? Or does it just not sound good to your ears? Regardless, in that case, I suggest you try executing the ideas you get. You suggested a "silent intermission", so try that, and see if it sounds good. Make attempts and don't be afraid to make mistakes (I'm using the word "mistakes" very, very loosely here).

Finally, making "cookie-cutter" songs as an exercise might be an interesting exercise, yes. *Might* be. It depends. It seems to me that you need to trust your intuition and your ears, and try following your instincts, even if you might just end up in a dead end and be forced to backtrack. There's always a risk, but that should be a source of excitement, not disappointment.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-01-16 00:55:08 massiveyacht<br>Oh man, I love this song!

I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is 4/4 with a lot of syncopation in the drums. If I were just notating the melody I would do it as:

6 bars of 4/4 for the first phrase
6 bars of 4/4 for the second phrase
5 bars of 4/4 for the final "Maybe that was it" and hanging around on the major root before it repeats.

I would say after 3 bars of 4/4 that that's a very emphasised 'push' in the drums on beat 4, but that doesn't signal the start of the bar. I think the bar structure is better dictated by the melody. There's that super weird slow counter rhythm on the ride bell that confuses things. Anyway great track!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-01-21 11:00:47 65TwinReverbRI<br>The better musical term for it is an Ostinato Figure.

You know, using the word "counterpoint" is maybe a little too academic.

For example, "For Your Love" by The Yardbirds has a bass line that goes E - G - A - A and a melody part that goes E-D-C#-C at the same rate.

These parts are "in counterpoint" but it's not a "contrapuntal piece".

IOW, we don't really use the word counterpoint to describe any time there happens to be one note in one part moving against another note in another part - if we did, everything would be counterpoint.

It's kind of like calling everything with Noodles "Pasta" - Ok, on some level they are,  but we have more specific terms like Spaghetti, or Lasagna, or Macaroni and Cheese.

So this Ostinato figure does create counterpoint with some other things some times, but it's all kind of happenstance rather than thought through and composed that way - compared to a "Contrapuntal" piece like a Fugue.

Pretty much, if it's pop music, it's unlikely to have any "real" counterpoint in it. There will be "counterpoint" by the strictest definition of the word in pretty much everything, but pieces that are primarily or exclusively "contrapuntal" are pretty rare (outside of some subset of parts, or in decidedly classically influenced music like prog rock - you know, the vocal section of Bohemian Rhapsody for example).

We're far more likely to find "Counter Melody" and things like that - for example, in one of the breaks in "Silly Love Songs" by Wings, there are a couple of voices doing different things all at the same time - this is "more contrapuntal" by combining a melody with a couple of counter melodies.

To put is simply, looking for "counterpoint" in pop songs is not the place to be looking for it. It's the exception, rather than the rule, which is "Homophony" - Melody with Accompaniment.

But it is a "continuum" to some degree - there's a little counterpoint in everything, to a lot in some things in pop.

But if you brought this into a class as an example of Counterpoint, it wouldn't be the best choice.

As for pop songs with Ostinato figures like that - pretty much everything. It's rampant. Ostinato is a much more common device in pop music.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-01-21 17:49:13 MadKingCabbage<br>Counterpunctual motion isn't really centered around a motif, rather it's more based on a secondary melody to counter the primary melody and support it. It also has very particular rules that even the guitar riff alone breaks.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-02-04 08:57:16 TomSerb<br>A melody note is a melody note.  In composition, chords are then chosen to support the melody note.  In improvisation, melody notes are chosen to fit over an existing chord structure.

The melody note can be a 3rd or 7th, but it can also be a root or 5th (or 9th, 11th, or 13th).  And it can be a *non-harmonic tone*, one that doesn't belong to the chord at all - it can be a passing note between chord tones, a neighbor tone (where the melody moves from a chord tone to an adjacent note and then back to the chord tone), an appoggiatura, or an anticipation of the *next* chord.  These are all really, really common in jazz (*and* other genres).

The bass note is the bass note.  It's the lowest sound being played.  It's often the root or fifth, but it can be any chord tone, and it can also be a non-harmonic tone.  Jazz is full of 'walking bass' lines that have non-harmonic tones.

The vast majority of the time instruments do NOT play the same note.  That's true in all genres - if it wasn't, all arrangements would be about as interesting as an acapella rendition of "Happy Birthday".

And this statement:

&gt; even counter melodies are usually the same note! 

makes no sense at all.  A counter melody is a melody that runs *counter to the main melody* \- if it's the same notes there's nothing counter about it, it's simply in unison.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-02-04 09:58:19 TomSerb<br>So can I.  I'm not sure what that has to do with anything, though.

I just did a quick test of your counter-melody theory.  I pulled out Bach's "Invention No. 1" which is just 22 measures long.  Of the 21 downbeats (the counter melody is tacet for the first two beats), the two melodies have the same note in three of them (one of which is the last measure, where you'd expect it, and one has the counter-melody resting for a sixteenth before playing the same note the main melody played on beat 1).  

So that's 3 out of 21.  Under 15%.  Pretty far from "usually" playing the same note.  Add in the beat 3s and you get 4 of 42, which is less than 10%

The downbeats are 3 unisons, 6 3rds, 1 4th, 3 5ths, 1 tritone, and 7 6ths.  So like I said, they're rarely dissonances (just one in this piece) and you'll have more 3rds and 6ths than unisons, 5ths and octaves (13 imperfect consonances to 4 perfect consonances).

This is going to hold true for pretty much any counter-melody.  It's basic counterpoint: use more imperfect consonances than perfect ones (which includes unisons/octaves).  That's been taught since at least Zarlino back in the 1500s.

&amp;#x200B;
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-02-04 19:00:32 Jongtr<br>&gt; I've learned that in traditional jazz the melody note is the 3rd or 7th of the chord

Wrong.  3rds and 7ths are "guide tones", which outline the *harmony* (chord sequence).   Accompanists (pianists or guitarists) will often play only 3rds and 7ths as a guide for a soloist, since they are enough to suggest the progression (a bassist may provide the roots, but even that is not always necessary).

Jazz standard melodies will *often* target chord tones - and the 3rd is a common one.  But it's quite wrong to say an unqualified "is" in that sentence.

&gt; I've been under the impression that the vocal melody, bass and other instruments (guitar or keyboard parts, for example) played different notes of the chord. For example, if a c major is played, each instrument plays a different note of the chord. 

That's an odd view.  What is true in jazz is that harmony instruments (piano or guitar) like to avoid doubling notes.  So if a bass player plays roots and 5ths, those tend to be avoided by the chord player.  But piano and/or guitar normally play *at least* 2 or 3 notes at a time - they may well include extensions or alterations of course, not just 3rd and 7th.  

&gt; I've been listening to different types of music, from steely Dan, to Metallica, to the Beatles and the bass, vocals and other parts all play the same note the vast majority of the time. Am I correct in saying this? 

In a sense, yes.  Rock music is much less concerned about the doubling of notes between instruments.  The bass will generally play roots (more than jazz), but chord instruments (guitars usually of course) will just play whatever comfortable voicing of the chords they know.  Doubling of notes is common, because it doesn't matter.  The finer points of harmony, of tonal progression, voice-leading and melodic resolution are of secondary interest (if any).  What matters is to just crank out the groove, and often the noisier the better.  Rock is nothing if not *loud.* ;-)   (However, Steely Dan would be a little more conscious of the finer points of harmonic function than, say, Metallica... ;-))  

&gt; It has absolutely blown my mind , which I am more than a little embarrassed to admit ( since I consider myself an advanced theorist and good songwriter)

Sorry but I find this hilarious: that an "advanced theorist and good songwriter" could have his mind blown by conventions in rock music that have been in place since the 1960s at least.  What planet have you been on?

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-06 00:04:49 Sean_man_87<br>Block chord writing should be like the bare-bones structure-- almost like the harmonic progression.  Adding non- chord tones is a good first step, thinking up counter- melodies would be the next. Maybe the bass line walks up or down, maybe you write everything up in a higher range for one section. Maybe one instrument has a little duo section with the melody, while the others drop out for a few bars. Variety is the spice.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-06 03:14:08 da7idb<br>Isn’t this like the exact opposite of COUNTER melody?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-06 04:57:45 purpleovskoff<br>Definitely not a counter melody. That's just playing harmonies. A counter melody is a melody distinct from the original. Counter to it, if you will
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-06 06:16:13 da7idb<br>Hmmm I thought that was just simple harmony. If you have a melodic line A and you have melodic line B and B is just A but up thirds or whatever, that's simple harmony, whereas counter melody would be a totally independent melodic line, not one that's just "play it again up a third".

Or at least I thought, maybe I'm wrong.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-12 02:17:10 person9<br>So let's talk Hard-bop for a minute.  In that style you often have very specific changes written out with a long list of altered extensions used.   It's complicated because of it's specificity, and you have to be able to jump from one very specific chord/scale, to another very particular chord/scale.  This take a lot of skill, but it can make things a bit rigid.

Modal charts, like "So What" is a bit different.  If you look at a chart it'll say Dm for 16 bars.  However, that's not all there is to it. Basically all that Dm chord tells you is that those are the notes that as a group you have chosen to, "sound right".  They'll sound like home.  There is just no preconceived path to and from there.  

So when comping in a modal style you don't HAVE to just sit on a D chord.  You can, and should at times, and play with rhythmic ideas, but you're also free to imply other movement.  The problem is that you don't want to get TOO functional with it.  Meaning that if you play a ii V I, in normal positions you're going to get something that sounds more...traditionally structured.

Instead focus more on voicings that are vague; such as built on 4ths, and more on scale motion than progressions.  Pick something like 11, 7, 13.  Make that home. Now practice chord scales using that voicing, like you would with a Joe Pass chart.  So 11, 7, 9 becomes 5, 1, 3, then 13, 9, 11, then 7, 3, 5, then 1, 11, 13, and so on.  You can also play little two note versions, which are GREAT...and if you think about those are mostly 4ths...so then you COULD invert those and just play 5ths...power chords!  So if you want it to sound more intense during a section you can SERIOUSLY just throw on an overdrive(or a fuzz, no judgement here), and go to town.  Now of course, you don't HAVE to stay inside either.  You can use chromatic passing tones/chords as well.  Just use the same voicing, and shift it a half step up.  Hit it, maybe hold it for a bit, and go down to something that works.  Or go from an "in" voicing, an "out" voicing to an "in" voicing.  Walk down chromatically for all I care.

Now that you have your sound palette what do you do with it? That depends on you and the soloist.  Give them SPACE.  Maybe you want to keep it simple for a while and just make some rhythmic jabs with one voicing, or a few of them.  Maybe you want to walk up and down the scale.  Maybe you want to sustain one, and every bar(with an anticipation maybe) drop down a chromatic step.  Maybe you want to play a little counter melody.  Maybe the soloist makes a short statement, and you want to try a mimic it in the space they're leaving.  Maybe you sit on a fat UGLY chromatic chord for a bit before resolving a half step up or down.  It's up to you, because there is no written path.  You can get as out as you want.  Just don't forget to real it back in to something relate-able, and TALK with your band members after playing and see what they like and down.

Lastly, remember it's a group effort, and you're supporting a soloist.  If they're pushing to go outside, then follow them.  If they don't, maybe stick to 4ths and playing in.  You can push a little bit, but if they're staying inside and relatively tonal then you probably don't want to sit on a stanky chord.  Maybe just use one in passing and very short.  This part is harder to describe, but it's all about using your ears, and communicating with the soloist while playing.  

So...this is all pretty difficult to do alone.  You really NEED  to practice with people to get the communication element going.  To work up to that I'd recommend playing over a D drone, and either a drum machine or a drum recording to get the voicings down, and get comfortable with what's out and in, and then....find people to play with as fast as possible.  

....fuck that got long.

there is one neat ted-talk + sequence; [contas gollumb- the perfect ping], where they describe a past need for a very good hash for sonar, which needed to be absolutely non-repetitive sequence of frequencies over time, so they could measure distance/movement of objects by their echo over time with null-ambiguity in the interferrence patterns of echoes, and they realized, that this hash would have to be the least repetitive music sequence, when it gets quantized the very same way (no note length and melody never repeats, there is no pattern in the sequence).

they play it on a piano (scaled to audible) , and the null-pattern-melodies sure are different.

"pattern free structured music, that only a mathematician could write, not intended to be harmonic"

they use a tiny modular+xorshift generator, its not even iterative, but the result has high cog...-complexity and low entropy, its hard to compress for most common compression methods, it sounds VERY random, but inherits a VERY simple generator, so it is far from random.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-16 14:48:46 UltraMuchacho<br>Hey, i can maybe help you out. I compose short orchestral pieces every now and then, but i never composed a full symphony. Please consider that, and that you probably know already more theory than me.

An Orchestra has 4 Sections: Flutes, Strings, Brass and Percussions. I sort the instruments for each section from high to low, before writing. I basically treat one section as one instrument, when i start a new segment. So it's basically composing a 3- instrument piece. First strings; they are the "bed" for the other instruments. You can play usual chords with them, or make a dramatic rythm.(Tbh, you can do what you want with each section, but i break it down that you have a learning effect.) Then comes the "main melody" with the brass and maybe a second violin. Brasses usually play not so much chords, but single notes. The flutes have a similar role like brass, but some kind of a more harmless version. They either support the strings, brass or playing for their own. You can use Brass and Flutes for a nice contrast (Dark Brass-&gt;Happy Flutes for example).  
When you have written a segment with the 3 sections, you start adding ornamentic for the individual instruments inside each section. Also you don't need to use all instruments for each segment. When you feel like just playing brass+ contra bass and stuff, just try it.

The progression itself is pretty classic. Instead of smashing the V-I serotonin thrusts in the listeners face as often as you can, you seek for a long and interesting path, that solves in a rewarding end for the listener (or not lol).

Please keep in mind that the variation is extremely huge, so you will find enough counter examples for my instruction.

Beethoven gives a good example for what i said: [https://musescore.com/classicman/scores/1196626](https://musescore.com/classicman/scores/1196626)  
Look how it's build on the strings, using the flutes as a top melody and brass often for pronounciation.  

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-17 00:46:59 65TwinReverbRI<br>Depends.

When we say "the melody", we either mean the highest sounding part, or the most important part that is presented as or we hear as the melody.

However, it is possible to combine multiple melodies simultaneously, or have a melody and a "counter melody", and even accompanying parts can be considered to be highly melodic if not melodies themselves.

If you're talking about 4 Part Harmony in terms of a Bach style Chorale, "the melody" was actually a pre-existing melody that would be familiar to people, and would be harmonized with the other parts. The Soprano part always got this.

So the Soprano has the melody (the Hymn tune) and the other 3 parts accompany it.

But, in 4 Part Choral Works, the melody could be sung in the Tenors while the other parts sing around it.

In Barbershop Quartets, which are in 4 Part harmony, the "Lead" gets the melody, and another part (called the Tenor) actually sings above it. So this is like the Alto having the melody.

The Bass could have the Melody.

You very well could also have a 4 part harmony that serves as an accompaniment itself, to which an additional melodic part is added.

Your word "derived" is a little tricky - I wouldn't say the melody is "derived" from anything.

I know this sounds like a cop out, or defining a word with that word, but the melody is what is the melody! It's hard to explain but you have to know what a melody is by listening to tons of music and identifying it. It's actually hard to define because if you say something like, "it's the thing you can follow" or "it's the thing that stands out" there are other musical elements that meet that definition - one can for example usually easily follow the Bass part in a 4 Part Chorale, but it's not the melody (but that is one of the reasons it can be considered "a" melody or very melodic even though it's not "the" melody).

Why do you ask, or what are you trying to accomplish?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-18 00:27:17 65TwinReverbRI<br>Yes.

Obviously though, just like you should be considering the melody in terms of harmonic and non-harmonic tones while analyzing harmonies, the harmony should also be considered in a melodic analysis.

But melodies can be taken out their harmonic context as well because the way we describe them isn't as tied up in harmony as the reverse.

Generally speaking - and I don't know of any systematic procedure - melodies are analyzed by things like their Pitch Contour, their High Point(s), whether they are primarily Conjunct (stepwise) or Disjunct (skipping, and also whether that involves "outlining harmonies or not) and whether they are primarily Diatonic or Chromatic. The Structure is also analyzed in terms of form, phrase length, melodic cadence (which can be distinct from harmonic cadence) and then especially, Pitch/Rhythmic motives (including contrapuntal permutations like inversions, retrogrades, etc. If you've ever looked an analyses of Contrapuntal pieces, a lot of this comes to the fore and the harmony is secondary in a lot of cases. The "character" of the melody can also be discussed - "static", "angular", and there are terms for some types of melodies especially in fugue subjects. There are "compound melodies" and melodies that display characteristics such as "octave displacement", and there are "counter melodies" as well (which generally are analyzed with their main melody counterpart to show how they interact and what qualities they share or differ by). Melodic Sequence is an important constructive principle and there are Real and Tonal Sequences. Of course we can talk about what Scale or Mode they're in where relevant, and in Atonal music talk about the Set and the intervallic progression of the melody especially in places where the interval vector is laid out neatly or manipulated in other permutations.
____

There is "Rhythmic Analysis" as well, but the amount of terminology and again any kind of systematic analysis is not as well described. Obviously we can talk about Meter, and Durations, Rhythmic Motives, retrogrades, rotations, Augmentation and Diminunution, things like Hemiola, use of tuplets, polyrhythm, polymeter, cross rhythm, and stylized rhythmic units used like "Claves" and other Rhythmic Ostinati, and things like Isorhythm (which has a melodic component as well). Obviously, Syncopation is a big issue, and we can talk about Stress, Stress Accents, and things like that. There are some rhythms associated with some types of pieces (durational stress on beat 2 of a Sarabande) and pieces like Barcarolles, Tarantellas, Marches, Waltzes, etc. have certain rhythmic expectations, and in South American music some of these aspects are extremely important (those pieces that alternate 3/4 and 6/8 for example). There is "Harmonic Rhythm" the rate at which the harmony changes and we also look at melodic phrases that continually begin with an Anacrusis (pickup note(s)) as "shifted" in relation to the meter in a way. There are - these are old terms so no one get their panties in a wad - Masculine and Feminine cadences (whether they fall on a strong or weak beat) and so on. There are pieces like "Divisions" which are like Theme and Variations, but each variation is more a rhythmic aspect than melodic one - each repeat of the theme is broken into, say, 8ths, then triplets, then 16ths, and so on. Some of that principle appears in regular T&amp;V as well, but these are more part of Spanish music.

That said, our idea of 'rhythm guitar' in Western pop music is entirely based in the idea of homophony. One guitar or singer plays a melody and the other guitar plays chords underneath it. You could instead treat the guitar more like a piano, by playing counter melodies (melodies similar to the main melody, but starting on different scale degrees and is harmonic with the main melody) while also providing some rhythmic support. That would be more in the realm of polyphony.

Coming up with a counter-example doesn't negate the premise. I would contend that changing the rhythm of a melody doesn't change the essential melody.

Of course they all interact, but why are you so adamant that they aren't different?

A better set of dimensions are pitch, rhythm, and volume. Do you have a problem with saying they are different?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-04-19 10:45:33 BenjaminShoe8<br>I think the answer to your question would largely depend on your definition of a baseline and the genre it's being played in.

According to my definition, a "good" baseline is a counter melody in a low range used to make more important melodies coherent, establish chord structure, or give the listener something consistent to hold on to as the music progresses.

A question and answer format could easily apply to my definition of a "good" baseline.

An example of the concept you are referring to I saw In the comments was Chameleon by Herbie Hancock. I think this is an excellent example of good use of your idea.

I hope this helped. Have a great weekend!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-05-16 05:59:53 earsablissin<br>If you like the sound of the chords without melody, usually it's because you like the bass movement. If you like the bass movement - that's already melodic content. Your musical taste and genre will judge the prominence of this line in the music.

But what that means is - you've kind of tied yourself down to a musical form through the bass. And adding whatever you think is a tasteful melody above that will be heavily effected and potentially limited by the bass movement if you're too rigid with that initial idea when you start adding a counter-melody. If you have a melody in bass, and a melody above, it's the melody above that will then be most noticeable and draw most attention. So it's important to recognise that.

The benefit to writing a top melody first is that the form is more open. You can play with an idea for a lot longer. And then harmonize it multiple ways. So there's a strong chance that a top line melody will be stronger off the bat. And might actually be easier and quicker.

There's nothing worse than sitting on a chord progression for ages trying to come up with a melody. A chord progression is just that - a nice progression. But it absolutely isn't the be all and end all of a song or piece. Well written music isn't just about an interesting progression - it's about everything else. So be careful getting stuck on chords, without considering the melody if you start with chords first.

Those lectures cover the basics through classical harmony. 

Most music theory at the start is just labels for stuff. You learn how to construct scales and chords because it's important to have a shared language to label things. Once you have that down you get into stuff like how they're typically used and why and how to create certain effects. That's where you get into stuff like harmony counterpoint and form. 

I think for the purposes of DAW composing learning counterpoint and the basics of functional harmony would be very helpful. A working familiarity with those will give you a feel for good melodies and how to make counter melodies and basslines along with what chords to use and why. It really helps you hear many parts at once and how they all fit together. Even in songs with just one melody, you want good voice leading in the chord progressions which is all rooted in counterpoint.

Any of the books in the sidebar will cover this stuff. Laitz the complete musician is good (but long winded) and the pdfs are floating around online if you poke around. Get a workbook for an old edition online and work through the exercises along with the book. Just reading or watching videos without practicing what you learn is pretty much a waste of time. 

Keep in mind it's a big subject and will take a while of study to go through (years). That said the gist of the basics isn't all that much. Try watching the YouTube channel 12 tone for quick summaries of stuff.

The sidebar has a bunch more book recommendations and it links threads that review each of them so you can find one you like. The books and order you study all matter less than practicing what you learn.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-06-10 20:42:42 SimplyTheJester<br>There is no one way I write. 

First, my best stuff comes when I'm not even thinking about writing.  Which unfortunately means getting it down in some form for keeps is about as inconvenient as can be.  With this method, I usually hear everything but actual words.  Drums, bass, keys, guitars, melody, etc.  I just try to capture as much of it as I can.  But it really means putting my current life on hold for a good amount of time, so if I know I can't do that I usually don't even try or hum the basics (or even beat box) into my phone's voice recorder.  So melody or chords?  For this one, \*yes\*.

Second best method is collaboration.  Because I am not truly pulling a complete song (or at least complete verse, chorus, intro) from nowhere, this can be a bit more hunt and peck.  For one thing, I'd stepping over the collaboration if I tried to offer everything.  And collaboration is one of the best ways to not get in a rut because it challenges you to do things "not your way".

Then there's the third way, which is actually thinking about chords v. beat v. melody v. embellishments, etc.  This is probably the most valuable way to get out of a rut. Not as in can't write anything rut, but as in recognizing you are starting to write songs that are too similar.  90%+ of the time, these are throw away compositions.  I'm probably trying out something new.  So it could be that I've become bored with my chord progressions from pure inspiration.  So in that case, I'm writing chords first.  It is less about theory as it is breaking out songs I like and figuring out what it is I like about them and then writing a few of my own bits in similar fashion.  Then I toss them out and let them creep in naturally via the "first" method so it comes organically.

To me, that is what theory is.  Getting out of ruts by challenging yourself to try something that doesn't come naturally until your own version of it does.  I can't even imagine writing a song in a mathematical type of formula.

NEXT.

If you are having problems with chords, then don't think about chords.  Think about doing harmonies.  Not straight 3rds harmonies or even the same rhythmic pattern as your melody.  But complementing parts that can be a counter melody.  Start with your melody, then write a complementary melody.  Then write a third complementary melody.   You are in a sense, creating chords.

Or write diads instead of chords.  Diads allow a lot of freedom, but they usually imply a larger chord.  So you can then come back to it later and find the missing notes of the chord.  But don't force it either.  If the diads sound just fine, then leave it at that.

You can also try hookpad (Google that).  It is like those old rhythm machines where you'd push a button for a chord.  Just smash away and use your ear.  Hookpad is set up so that you will stay relatively pleasing to the ear.  But it can also be frustrating when you know what chord you want, but can't seem to find it in the options.  But is more for easy experimentation.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-06-10 21:33:52 MostlyTiredUser<br>I usually start by picking a key, melody, then a counter line, harmony inferred from the counterpoint, bass line and then maybe a beat.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-06-13 11:06:36 Mardi_grass26<br>Try not to make the bass line a extremely ear catching melody all the way through. It sounds counter-intuiative bc we want every bit of music we write to sound good but the bassline should add interest where the melody *can't* or add interest where the other instruments would naturally want to pull away bc there's a very particular spot in the music for bass playing. Also try to make your bass lines "elaborate" on themselves. There should be precedent and anticendent phrasing in the bass line and fills that are separate from the melody phrases

I just never thought of it as counter point! Thank you again for taking the time, this was fantastic.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-06-29 02:29:16 sup3rcunt<br>i think you’re really massaging perspective onto the piece here. 

days gone is totally an instrument driven melody as is rain song. you said it yourself; it was supposed to be an instrumental. 

the vocal melody kind of floats on top and plays a counter point to the guitar. 

also, if you analyze them as instrumental driven melody based tunes, you can see how they are constructed much more simply than they seem at first glance. 

Rain song is just a cycling reuse of shapes that lend themselves over and over to DGCGCD tuning that chase melody notes on the B string and high D (if i remember the tuning correctly).

i’m not really here to argue, though, nor really post an opinion... you asked the question. 

my answer is basically: it’s much more simple than that, and HAPPENS to be nameable in the way you described in the post.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-06-30 09:57:04 MusicJohnston<br>Coming up with a melody at an instrument is a great start. But having contrasting sections (i.e. verse/chorus or A/B/A forms) is what really transforms background tracks into songs. Kinda like how most buildings generally have a bunch of rooms, unless they're big empty warehouses or little sheds. 
I would suggest diagramming your song out on a regular old piece of paper, section by section, until you have a rough idea of the how the whole track goes. And then from there you can go into the daw and record everything.
A countermelody is just what you might expect--a melody that goes counter to the main melody.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-07-29 16:51:26 soundofyogi<br>To answer my curiosity, what's the instrument you are playing? and what's the instrument of melody and counter melody on the section your band leader wants you to fill?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-07-29 16:58:18 Jongtr<br>Essentially you need a second counter melody.  I don't necessarily agree with [M3talguitari5t](https://www.reddit.com/user/M3talguitari5t/) that you shouldn't be "stealing the show" - maybe that's what your director wants you to do?  I.e., your line should probably stand out as the lead line, over and above the existing melodies.  That would be the point of a "solo".  Otherwise, if he just wanted you to blend in, he would have asked you to simply write an additional counter melody.

You don't say what instrument you play, but the easy way to stand out above the current melody is simply to play higher.  If you can do that, you don't need anything fancy - just follow chord tones in a different way from how the other melodies are.  But you probably also want some kind of dynamic or rhythmic interest - to make your playing sound *individual, expressive.*   Whatever you play should be more *rhythmically active* \- not necessarily more notes, or faster, but more *syncopation.*
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-01 06:40:24 MaggaraMarine<br>&gt;Except they aren’t the same.

Changing the place of one note and changing another note to a different one (that really doesn't impact the harmony) doesn't make something different.

&gt;And under pressure is an awful example because it was the exact same.

It wasn't - Ice Ice Baby has an added 8th note in it. But my point is exactly this - a minor change doesn't make something different.

&gt;They both are derivative lazy songs with shit writers.

Doesn't matter.

The melodies are the same, and since that melody is in a central part in both songs, it is fair to argue that it is the "melody" of both of the songs. (Though the Katy Perry song also has some other melodies in it, but this particular melody is an important part of the "drop".)

&gt;You can’t copyright a tempo. The beats are  different. You think you can copyright a drum beat? Guess that’s the end of drums.

I never said you can. I said that all of those elements combined together is what contributes to the songs sounding even more similar. The drum beat alone isn't copyrightable, true. The tempo alone isn't copyrightable, true. But both of these in combination with the melody (that is the same) creates a sound that makes the songs sound even closer to each other. My point is, the context in which these melodies are used is very similar. If I wrote a slow piano ballad that somehow managed to hide this melody in it - for example it was some kind of a counter melody, nobody would say it sounds anywhere close to either of these songs.

&gt;Also, just because two people wrote a lazy ass synth part that actually  have differences in progression and tone, doesn’t make it the same.

First you talk about how you can't copyright drum beats or tempo, but now the tone of the synth is somehow relevant? The tone of the synth doesn't change anything - it's the same exact melody and has the same exact function in both pieces. Yes, it is a simple part. But that doesn't change the fact that it is the same melody. (Again, changing the place of one note and changing another note to a different one doesn't make it a different melody, just like adding an extra 8th note in the end of a bassline doesn't make it a different bassline.)

&gt;Further Beastie Bors already established you can’t copyright a chord progression.

This isn't a chord progression, it's a melody. Again, irrelevant.

Again, I'm not arguing that Katy Perry deserved to be sued over this. All I'm saying is that the melodies (regardless of how simple they are) in both of these songs are basically the same. And admitting that they are basically the same melody shouldn't affect anything. You don't win a case by denying reality (well, actually, I guess you do - but I would say if your argument depends on denying reality, it's not a very strong argument), you win it by presenting evidence that the part that sounds similar is insignificant/generic enough not to be copyrightable. This is what Led Zeppelin did with their Stairway to Heaven lawsuit, and this is why they won. There's no denying the fact that the intro of Taurus and Stairway to Heaven sound really close to each other (though the differences between those parts are still bigger than the differences between the Katy Perry melody and the Christian rap melody), but because they could find examples of other songs that sounded similar, the idea was too generic to be copyrightable.

I do think it's a fair argument to say that it's simply too generic a melody to be copyrightable, and I wouldn't disagree. Also, it is ridiculous if the Christian rap group now becomes the main songwriter of the song when in reality they just wrote that synth line - that's a really small part of the song, and not really even a part of the most important part of the song that is the vocal melody and lyrics. As Rick Beato said in his video, it would have been fair to give them like 10% of the song, but if they now basically own the song, that's ridiculous.

Firstly, one of the things I have often caught myself doing is trying to "force" more things in than are really necessary.

This came mostly from me trying to emulate what I **thought** music did, rather than **knowing** what music did - either because I hadn't played enough or studied it critically enough.

This often happens to beginners as well who feel the need to have "thick chords with lots of notes" as well as "complex" music - I suppose there's a fear that if you don't write enough notes your music will be "too simple" or "not complex enough".

However what I really learned by paying a lot more attention to the **Musical Textures** that various composers wrote was that sometimes, just the melody by itself is all you need.

Sometimes it seems like some melodies "demand" very complex accompaniments, and others very simple accompaniments. And sometimes either will be OK.

What I would suggest is for you to try to "set" this melody in as many different ways as you can think of.

Firstly, by itself.

Secondly, with just a single bass line, maybe just the roots of the chords, and no "inner" parts.

There is such a thing as "outer voice counterpoint" or "Soprano-Bass Counterpoint" so rather than just imply harmony with your bass line, it could also form it's own "melodic stream" either with just whole measure values - but implying inversions and so on along with the harmony.

However it could also "outline" the harmony (and include inversions if you like) by moving in quarter notes or even doing counter-rhythms and so on.

Think about this very carefully: If you look at your first measure, it REALLY strongly implies an Em chord.

So **do you really need any other supporting voices?** You can certainly have them if you want, but for me personally I like to "justify" things I do - so I don't put notes in "just because they can". When I write I want every note to have intent - a "purpose" so to speak.

IOW, while an E in the bass might be necessary harmonically, something else about the musical texture might give it a purpose for being there - maybe it's for Violin and Cello duet.

If the texture you *really* wanted was block chord triads, well, you have that.

Then you can also decide if you really need or want 3, or 4 parts. IOW, don't just write 4 parts becuase that's what you hear about all the time. It's WAY over-represented in theory discussions. 2 part counterpoint and 3 part counterpoint are very common, as are 2 and 3 part "harmonic" writing - more of melody with accompaniment as opposed to counterpoint.

Think about this for a second: How different would this melody be if you played a 3 beat E, then F#, just like you have your bass line, say for Violin and Cello, versus playing this on Piano with broken octaves (low E high E low E high E, etc.) in 8th notes?

Totally different feel.

So you also have to decide those kinds of things - or experiment with them.

Which is why I suggest setting this in as many different ways as you can think of (and look at other pieces for examples).

_______

Another thing you need to work out is if you want to adhere strictly to an archaic style, or if you want to do a "looser" modernistic style.

The ii^o chord would be in first inversion in the Common Practice Period, however, there are many elements about your melody that are "against the rules" of Common Practice Period writing.

So why are you worried about the ii when your melody is full of astylistic things?

See the problem here is, if you REALLY want to write like that music you REALLY need to study it IN GREAT DETAIL.

That comes from listening to it, playing it, analyzing it, and really really really digging into the specifics.

What you have instead is what a lot of people do - you have the "surface" elements - things you **think** "sound like" what you've heard, but actually have issues.

Yet like a lot of people you're kind of hung up on these other "rules" of harmony - this is such a super common thing - if you want to write stylistically accurate music, you have to follow ALL of the rules, not just the ones you pick, or only the ones you've learned about not knowing there are others, and furthermore, not knowing that these rules don't apply to other styles.

Now, as a beginner, yeah, you have to learn one thing at a time, so that's fine. But my point is, don't get too hung up on the "rules" and instead go to the MUSIC to write music.

Look at what other composers would do with a melody like this.

This is not a "Chorale Melody" - a Hymn Tune - so you're not going to be able to write 4 part chorale style parts to it very easily. It doesn't lend itself well to that.

It might lend itself well to Initiative Counterpoint, and really the place to start with that is a canon (though canons are written a measure at a time, though it could just be an imitative thing and not a strict canon).

Here are a couple of examples of the first 4 measures set in different textures:

https://musescore.com/user/32723609/scores/5670397

Note that these are simply examples, not meant to be "exactly like Bach would do" or anything like that, nor would these be necessarily what I'd do with this, but just to give you some ideas to work from without "writing it for you" so to speak.

The first is Canoncic/Imitative, the second "Murky Bass" or Broken Octaves, the third Bass and Inner part, and the last more like a "walking bass" that outlines the chords (didn't always stick to your harmonies but stayed close).

Hope this helps.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-11 23:31:45 Zak_Rahman<br>I believe that diatonic music is, at its most fundamental level, the result of changes between sequential intervals.
Going from tonic to minor third has a fundamentally different feeling to going from tonic to tritone.

A melody and bass in a simple counter point of exercise is just two sets of intervals at the same time.

A triad is just three intervals. A chord change is the sum of those intervalic changes.

No matter how complex the arrangement may be, it ultimately always boils down to the movement between intervals. Movement is important here. Take a minor second interval. If you pedal between the tonic and minor second, you'll get a "Jaws" like effect. If you use the minor second to bridge to the next scale tone, then it has a very different impact. So it's not just distance but also the movement between them.

Ultimately, I don't think you need to understand why intervals are important to benefit from them. However, you do well to ask. Knowledge and learning is cool.

Hopefully someone can provide a more technical response. However, as a guitarist, I found that studying intervals saved me from pentatonic prison and I don't use tabs anymore.

When writing, I can make more varied and daring compositions. When soloing I can pick out the tones I want faster and more accurately.

Anyhow, all the above is nothing more than my opinion. But at this current point in time, I think studying intervals is nothing but beneficial even if you don't technically understand why (which I clearly do not).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-12 14:18:51 65TwinReverbRI<br>Here, I just made this little example to demonstrate it for you:

https://musescore.com/user/32723609/scores/5673395

A Melody is a single line of music, usually sung by or played on a single instrument by a person.

It is what most people sing when they "sing a song" or "hum a tune" and so on.

The first like of my example is marked "Melody" and that's the tail end of "Yankee Doodle".

Harmony is what is created when more than one note is played at a time. It forms what we call "chords". The second line marked "Harmony" is an example of some Chords - 3 note chords that form Harmony.

The third line shows these Chords being used as an Accompaniment to the Melody - marked as such. Together the Melody and the Chords are all part of the Harmony.

Harmony is everything that is sounding at once, while the Accompaniment is the element that "accompanies" the melody.

In the next line I made another Melody. This melody is slightly different than the first one in that it actually implies the harmony in that the notes are more the notes of the chords so we can almost hear more harmonic implications. It is not harmony itself, but it implies a possible harmony (so does the first melody but most of us know the tune and expect a certain harmony).

The next line combines the two melodies so they together form harmony, and are still both melodies (this is called Counterpoint) and one of the lines will be heard as "accompanying" the other - partly because it's lower and that is common, partly because the upper one is the familiar tune we know so we'll hear the other as "less important" in that way, and partly because it implies chords on its own and chords generally serve as accompaniments to melody.

Finally, I took the two melodies and put them together while taking the original chords and breaking them up into individual notes.

This is where things get a little tricky because all of the things together form Harmony, and chords, but there is a Melody, in counterpoint with another melody, or we sometimes call this a Counter Melody, and then the broken up chords sort of create their own melody line, though since they're more obviously broken up chords we'd probably consider them more "chords" or "harmony" and note a "melody" per se. And, the 2nd melody could be accompanying the first and the chords could be accompanying both - so music can get multiple layers like this. 

If you try to start with multi-layered textures like that, it will be harder to differentiate things because sometimes melodies can be accompanimental and form the harmony!

So better to start with something like the 3rd line, where there's a melody on top, accompaniment on the bottom, and then they both form harmony together, but the accompaniment is also it's own chords. We even call this kind of texture "Melody with Accompaniment" and just assume that the two together form harmony.

Hope that all helps.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-22 04:31:00 Basstickler<br>\#4- In case my name hasn't given it away yet, this is my bag.  I love writing bass lines and playing with my band in particular provides me a lot of room for creativity.  There are a few approaches I take but I always try to serve the song above all else. (I'll provide some links to my band's album and describe the approaches I took in a couple songs for some examples of my own creative approach)

&amp;#x200B;

Writing a unique bass line that doesn't really change the song is kind of an art and requires a good bit of practice to be able to pull off regularly.  There are a couple issues to deal with.  First off, the traditional role of bass is to provide a solid harmonic grounding and to connect the harmonic and melodic instruments to the rhythmic ones.  This basically means that bass players or bass parts have a certain role that they are expected to fulfill and breaking too far from the traditional approach to this is going to subvert the feeling that you're actually fulfilling that role.  Second, bass notes are big (long wavelengths) and have a much higher likelihood of causing unwanted dissonances in your piece.  Part of the concept of dissonance and consonance has to do with how frequently the sound waves of your different frequencies line up, where more frequently lining up is going to sound more consonant.  So choosing certain notes in the bass range will have a much more dissonant sound than using those same notes in a higher register.  You've likely noticed this if you ever tried to play a major triad very low on a piano and it just sounds like mud.

&amp;#x200B;

So the challenge comes down to how to choose notes that are going to be "cool" without subverting the role of the bass and/or adding unwanted dissonances.  It's always going to be easiest to maintain the sound/vibe of what you've already written by just throwing root notes in the bass, as that will maintain the harmonic feel you've already established.  From there, you can consider rhythmic elements to add a sense of groove.  These can either follow the feel of the already established parts, or could be a counter rhythm to provide variation, or a mix of both.

&amp;#x200B;

I would recommend learning a bit about walking bass lines.  The idea of a walking bass line is to provide smooth motion from chord to chord.  If you're just playing root notes and your chord roots move more than a step at a time, particularly if they're more than a third, the root notes can sound a little disjointed.  Depending on style/genre/approach, this may not be an issue but a walking bass line can be used to make the movement of the bass from one root to the next sound more smooth.  This is generally accomplished by adding notes, including non-chord tones, in a stepwise manner between the roots.  Taking this to a rock setting, you can choose to add extra notes as a means of moving toward your next chord.  This is happening a bit in the example you gave as a good interesting bass line, where the bass player often chooses to play notes that are a step away from the root of the next chord in the progression.  

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the concern for dissonance coming from the bass can be disregarded in certain contexts.  A particularly dissonant sounding note being used to push into the next chord can be great, as the dissonance is quickly and thoroughly resolved.  This can also be applied to moving to different notes within the same chord, where you might add a note from outside the key, maybe a halfstep above or below, which adds a dissonance that is quickly resolved to the root or another chord tone.  Playing notes stoccato or for short note lengths can also provide some forgiveness of the dissonance factor simply because it is not happening for a very long time.

&amp;#x200B;

For rhythm, I take a few approaches.  Sometimes I will base my rhythm on the vocal part, where I'll play the root, possible some notes to move to the next chord, following the rhythm of the vocals, sometimes entirely, sometimes just for a few words.  Other times I could be following the drums if they've come up with a cool rhythm.  Or I could come up with a counter rhythm.  This is really about trying to find something that goes against what is happening but does so in such a way that it won't take away from anything else that's happening.  It's hard to provide a formula for this, as it's really about trying something out and listening critically to make sure that it goes with everything else.  There are some easy rhythms you can try, like dotted 1/4, dotted 1/4, 1/4, which generally works in most situations where you have one chord per bar.  This really takes some experimenting to get your creativity to line up with your musical tastes though, so I recommend practicing this by trying to write a few different bass lines to each song you're writing for, if you have the time to do so.

The Crumb bass line uses a bit of a pedal tone for the "riff", where the bass hangs on primarily one note and doesn't follow the chord changes.  Then he just adds a rhythm to that and a little slide at the end of the phrase/subphrases.  It's not a particularly complicated thing to emulate.

&amp;#x200B;

The overall connection between the drums and the bass really has to do with the role I was describing earlier on, where bass is the main connector between everything else in the band and the drums, so having them locked in makes the whole rhythm section sound more like it belongs with everything else happening.  One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is to have the kick drum and bass line follow each other on most or all notes.  This is very common in Funk music.  If you have a whole lot of bass notes, like constant 16ths, then this approach doesn't really have the same effect (assuming your drummer can play double bass that quickly to begin with).  The kick rhythmically doubling the bass also makes each of these things sound bigger in the overall mix.  The kick provides a nice thick attack to your bass notes and your bass notes provide a pitch and an extended low note to the kick.  This can also cause some problems with mixing once you get to the point of recording but I won't get into that here.  If you're ever playing slap bass, you can often have kick line up with the slapped notes and the snare line up with the popped notes, though this very much depends on the approach of the slap bass part.

&amp;#x200B;

Bass does often get relegated to the back of the mix, so to speak, where it can be hard to hear exactly what's happening.  You'd almost certainly notice if the bass weren't there though.  As I mentioned above, a lot of times the kick and bass are rhythmically doubling each other, so that can further obscure the bass as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Interaction with the vocals can be interpreted a few ways.  A lot of times you don't want to have a bass fill happening during other important parts.  So if I'm producing a track that currently has no vocals and there's a little space, it might sound cool to add a bass fill, however, if the vocal part is going to have a pickup into the next phrase or section, that bass fill could get in the way or take away the value you get from the pickup.  You often times don't want to have anything too rhythmically complicated happening under important vocal parts, though this definitely isn't a rule.  This is often avoided in Pop music, where it's basically vocals over everything else in almost every situation.  You also tend to have a lot of non-chord tones in the vocal melody, depending on style, so the note choice in bass can positively or negatively impact that.  It may be complimented by the bass playing non-chord tones at the same time, or it might be better to have the bass hold steady on a given note.  In the former, you're either emphasizing the step away from the harmony by stepping away with it or you're making the vocal fit in more by having it not be the only thing playing non-chord tones.  The latter allows the vocal part to feel separate by having a constant beneath it, or can provide a sense grounding it by keeping the context present.

&amp;#x200B;

You can also try using inversions (this is a link to an answer I provided on a Stack Exchange forum regarding inversions, which will likely provide you with a lot of ideas to try:  [https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/29176/rules-of-how-the-bass-should-and-should-not-move-in-chord-progressions/29189#29189;](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/29176/rules-of-how-the-bass-should-and-should-not-move-in-chord-progressions/29189#29189;) I generally recommend heading over to SEMusic but the rules are a lot more strict there, such as only one question per post and a strong avoidance of asking duplicate questions, so it's not for everyone).

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this helps, since I just took forever to write it up because I'm a long winded bastard.  I'll try to follow up with my specific examples from my band in the comments below.

chord tones&gt;non-chord tones&gt;chromatics

A good bassline knows how to support the music *rhythmically* first, then gooses it up with a counter line.  It's melody will draw from chord tones, non-chord tones and chromatics all to add color and tension when you deem appropriate.  Sometimes all that won't be necessary.  Other times, it'll be just the ticket.  You'll have to be the judge.  Just don't forget the rhythm!

Intricacy can also be achieved through gestures and ornaments:
* staccato
* hammer-on's/pull-off's
* muted or dead notes
* slides
* grace notes
* harmonics
* tremelo
* trills
* vibrato
* bends
* double and triple-stops (i.e., bass chords)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-30 09:51:47 65TwinReverbRI<br>r/composer is probably the better place to ask.

You are right that classical music "transitions" in ways that are maybe not always as "stark" as pop music does (but there are of course counter-examples in each genre, but I know what you mean).

Honestly, probably the best way to do this is just start listening to a lot of classical music (and soundtracks of course) and try figuring out why smooth transitions are smooth, and then try to use those elements yourself.

I think one big issue of why what you're experiencing happens is because people will often write sections independently, and they try to "force" them together and you end up with patchwork. This can work well in other genres and is even common in some, but it's less common in the more "classical style" (though of course, as I said, it does happen).

So obviously, don't just compose 2 different things and then try to put them together and come up with a smooth transition. While it could work, or you can sometimes make it work, generally speaking it's less likely to work than other approaches.

One approach that can work well instead is to use an idea from your first section in your second section. For example, what is an accompaniment in your first part becomes a more important element in the second part.

For example, maybe you've got a section with a melody and the harmony is in 1/4 note chords. Then maybe on the first repeat of your melody the 1/4 note chords start playing in 8th notes. Then, as you near the end of that section, they move into triplets for maybe the last two beats or last measure or two, then those "lead into" the next section where the triplets become a melody that moves more in triplets over a once again chordal accompaniment. Or the triplets could become a new accompaniment, and so on.

A lot of this kind of music "builds on motives", which means things appear, and then are developed in many different ways.

Also, you get "interplay" between lines, such as calls and responses and imitation and things like that.

So for example, a line will cadence in the melody, but the bass, or accompaniment will "echo" the line and carry it over into the next section.

Here's a very simple example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llZxwf8Dq4w

Notice in the 4th measure, the accompaniment picks up the same "motive" from the melody in m. 3 (though "inverted" - it ascends rather than descends) and then that motive itself becomes the idea for the next 3 melody measures (descending).

That same rhythm is used again to "lead into" the repeat of the main idea.

Now this one cadences firmly on the last measure of the 1st page, but notice at least the bass note "adds a note" to provide some forward motion (note also that the whole first page is repeated, so anything written here would have to work equally well for leading back to the repeat and the next section, so sometimes it's "more final" like it here, and other times there are two different endings).

On page 2, you'll notice that motive is picked up yet again, and then both voices move together (in opposite motion) in 1/4 notes, which is a call back to the 1st measure's melody.

Also notice that where the first page had slow moving notes for the most part accompanying the melody, this has much more "activity", and even the melody has a part where there are all 8th notes in the measure.

Now just as a point, it would be a more "disconnected" effect if the first part were 1/4 notes and the second part suddenly just started moving in 8ths. But by introducing the 8th note motive early on in combination with quarter notes (on beat 1) this full measure of 8ths has already been "presaged".

The 4th measure on page 2 of the melody is yet another new idea but it's kind of a combination of m.1 and m.2 on this page. Then that melody is used for the "main" (or starting idea) of the next little section.

Finally at the end, there's one little new idea for sort of a "flourish" at the end with the 16ths (and the trill-type ornament).

So you see this piece is extremely "economical" - it uses a few small ideas that are often related, or varied versions of other ideas, that serve to introduce variety without being completely different elements. It also "presages" an idea that becomes "more important" in a later section by introducing it earlier as a "one off" - but again the one off version is still related to other elements in the piece.

Then some of these ideas are used also in the accompaniment to "lead into" some of the next ideas. Likewise, while the 2nd page is built from ideas from the 1st page, it's also "more activity" in the parts which helps the whole piece to "build" and "progress" (or evolve is even a really good word) in a logical manner.

Notice there's a note on every beat in every single measure except the final cadence measures - which while it doesn't carry over or "push to" the next section, it serves as a sense of finality for that section - and that's necessary because otherwise it's been constantly moving. If there hadn't been as much motion previously, the composer may have opted to use an idea like what's in the accompaniment in the "leading on" measures there, instead of in the earlier places. And also, when you have constant 1/4 motion with something on each beat, it could get plodding, so the rhythmic variation maintains interest and serves as "directed motion" (especially since those things are melodic lines that lead to specific notes) and the "interplay" between the parts - when one part holds a note or rests, the other part moves allows for "forward propulsion" if you will, but it's not both parts doing the same thing together every time, which would be a different effect.

And this is just a simple piece!

So if you can grab some music and start going through it thinking about these kinds of things it will help you come up with ideas on how you can do it yourself (or just steal from these!).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-30 15:17:51 system__addict<br>hi! to address the technical definition: an arrangement in music suggests that a composition already exists and something is being changed, but to speak to that idea and the idea of how to  set apart the different factors of a musical composition:

1) **try to avoid different instruments excessively overlapping frequency-wise (use different octaves/voicings)** 

 Be aware of  [Consonance and Dissonance](http://www2.siba.fi/muste1/index.php?id=65&amp;la=en) which is maybe on a larger scale - the abstraction of what you're speaking to. The use of either similar or different voicing (timbre/tone/texture or however you break it down) will set a mood.  Ultimately you could run off into the % likelihoods of sound system capabilities and that wouldn't be unreasonable regarding 'separation of sound' but to speak from a puritan basis: the more the instruments sound different, the more variation they have in range of pitch, and the more obvious variation there is between them the more distinguishable the parts are and the more its noticeable if they're working together or not.

I don't mean to word it like an a\*\*hole but if you consider like a traditional techno sound - everything is completely synced via harmony, melody, progression, separation of voicing, etc. whereas jazz/folk/hiphop - often times asynchronous. 

&amp;#x200B;

 2) **make sure different instruments complement each other rhythmically** 

Timing is everything, sure. Different instruments may fill in or join together or solo/be quiet for various periods to create different moods, but being aware of how they carry together throughout a composition often times focuses on a 'rhythmic rendezvous'  when the harmony is lead by an instrument and others are allowed to pip, reinforce, or counter. 

3) **less is more** 

This is a dangerous concept. Less ... work? less sound? less music less silence? There is a natural truth to simplicity and not over working a composition or instrumentation . However - Maybe more truthfully: Enough is enough. ??  :: At some point you'll realize you've wasted time and at that point you can go back and try to make sense of what  you should have been doing instead. Personally I think it's easy to get caught up in the human act of conquest when trying to understand music / music composition / recording / performing. but all of these are different beasts. The dimensions of music balance each add to each other and show themselves in regards to what the composer finds novel about that work. Sometimes less is more. Sometimes more is neessary. Sometimes we are expressions of ourselves  or something else entirely,

4)  **if mixing it takes a lot of effort, it's probably badly arranged**.

more than anything i want you to know that this is not true. I say that because this is asking when to stop dancing. you have to develop a feel for when is right for you. A great escape is why is the mixing taking a while - well if its because you're new to the elements : new program, new idea, new genre, new material : whatever it is : there might be a technicality - similar to a physicality as to why its taking longer than expected to put together. 

I would suggest that if mixing it takes a lot of effort its never because of the arrangement but because of the approach, a misappropriate of ambition/intent, or because  somehow mixing and arranging were seen as two totally different processes. They mean almost the same thing and musically, the idea of mixing x arranging should be shared so that the process and output can both  be recognized.

&amp;#x200B;

Great questions
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-01 07:09:40 AnonymousBoiFromTN<br>To be fair there are typically three ways to judge the music itself with broad storkes without getting into tonality, timbre, and such. Rhythmic, Harmonic, and Melodic. Though you could add lyrical but we are strictly doing theory and not poetics here. Harmonically they are about the same in basing chords, and just like later Classical music and some jazz the use of petal tones int he bass register to keep a steady tone while moving between the circle of fourths is prevelant in Trap music as well depending on the artist. Melodically Classical easily takes the cake because trap music isnt made to be heard for the intent of feeling the music flow like a melody does. Trap was made for dancing and to keep a "Hype" mood when, let say, entering a club. This is why when it comes to Rhythmic Trap is much much better soley because classical didnt have the heavily percussive scores that Trap typically does. Trap uses, on average, fast computer generated or drum pad made beats that revolve around fast high-hats, unexpected snare (thats made as off beat as possible typically on the e's and a's of a beat but repetively done to assert the beat) and loud and ground kicks/bass tones that are meant to solidify the down beat with an occsionally off beat kick to lead into the next phrase or measure.

Its really hard to compare the two simply because: they serve vastly different purposes, individual artists within a genre vary DRAMATICALLY in composition and performance, and modern music is typically harder to recreate when done synthetically and especially when done by instrumental use because over the ages people have become very different in how they play music causing technical abilities to shift. A good example of this was brought up by Adam Neely who used the example of Eruption by Van Halen and how at the time it was a mega complicated song with tapping abilitys otherwise unseen and nearly impossible to recreate. But now-a-days its a rock standard you can find videos of 12 year olds doing.

LD;DR : They are the same in compositional difficulty and complexity. Trap is better at rythmic writing and Classical os better at melodic, though its difficult to compare two bastly different genres with different jobs to fulfill.

Edit: in case anyone gets confused. I meant the circle of fourths just as i wrote it. Basically moving counter-clockwise across the circle of fifths and passing through fourths which creates more illusion to whether the modulations are leaning towards Consonance or Dissonance until finally resolving. (Examples can be found in later-Era Miles Davis records and alot of gospel music in this chord change, and as i said later classical pieces, typically operas as those used harminic structures similar to the passing chords used in "Jazzy" arrangments of songs). This usage is almost ckmpaeavle to grunge musicians using power chords and five chords in order to create an illusion of whether the chords are minor or major (in more simplified chord progressions like 90s rock and even in more complex forms of standard Israeli piano music) typically seen as "Happy or Sad" so you dont know what to feel causing unease until your brain registers the repetitions allowing you to hear the music through the standard I ii iii IV V vi vii I major modulation allowing us to put the chords in context, but still holding onto that lost 3rd, which many will point out is the most important note of a standard triad. Im rambling too much now, ill shut up. Have a good day and i hope this helped!

“You can’t burn out if you were never really on fire”

This may seem harsh to a group of people expected to have a relatively high level of musical output, but it kind of conditioned us to think differently about what we consider “burning out”. He also added later that there was a good way of avoiding burnout, or even creative walls.

“Some music is better than none music.”

If you hit a wall, write something in regardless! It doesn’t have to be good; I for one write in certain chord progressions or just a melody and maybe a counter with it between two sections of pretty well developed material. Once I go back on that “some music” with a fresh mind and session I can kind of twist it into something that works, and it gets refined over time.

I guess my gist here is, don’t worry about burning out before you feel like you’ve peaked. Just try putting something down, because there’s nothing more daunting than a blank page to a person with seemingly no ideas coming about. You’d be surprised how far it’ll get you!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-10 00:47:08 KingAdamXVII<br>I don’t know, I agree that it’s at least ambiguous. If you view it as I-bVII-IV the melody walks down 3-2-1. If you interpret as V-IV-I, the leading tone in the melody consistently resolves downwards.

And that “leading tone” often sounds to me like a flat blues third of the “V” chord. That is, the progression occasionally sounds like i-bVII-IV to me, which makes a lot more sense than v-IV-I.

Anyways, to counter your main point, I hear the first chord as the tonic, not the final.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-12 16:00:05 Xenoceratops<br>Can you clarify?
&gt;These are melodies that don't have interval leaps beyond a major third (after a few measures or so, which is all we would need)

So our recommendations should not have any leaps beyond a major third?

&gt;don't have many repeated notes

This is pretty clear.

&gt;Melodies should also avoid using chords if possible (counter-example: Chopin's Waltz Op.64 No.2; if it does have chords, I should otherwise be able to simplify the melody by omitting lower notes).

When I read this, I thought you meant that the melodies should not outline chords, but then I saw your example. Do you mean the melody should not be contrapuntally harmonized? Seems like a simple fix, just play the melody sans harmonization.

Anyway, [this is the obvious choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-18 09:32:49 south87<br>Good work, I see a good amount of creativity and intuition. Overall, what is lacking is compositional technique. What does that mean? That you cannot see yet the complete potential in your music. Maybe you do but you cant fully write it out yet, mainly because you dont know all the paths you could take. I see great stuff here.

The first piece could benefit from textural changes involving all instruments in terms of register. For starters, all the melodies occur in unison. Try moving that around. Also, the Piano is too static. The progression and rhythm is ok but you could keep the steady beat while adding registral variation. Also, its ok if the Piano doesnt help with the melody all the time, give it something else to do with the right hand. 

In composition, you can't repeat yourself. Basically keep your structure and the first 13 bars, they work fine as they are. For the remaining bars, change the interval relation between the wind instruments and change the accompaniment a bit with each section. 

I think it could benefit if you make a return to the first theme. The material just before the end deserves to have its own section, its interesting. Why not make the piece an ABA?

The second piece: don't use literal repetition! Write out the whole thing again but with registral variations, maybe add a counter melody, maybe change a few chords, make it go somewhere else!

Thats my take on the first 2. You have some good material, check some composition resources in the sidebar so you can improve your technique.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-19 10:01:23 JMcSquiggle<br>Not really a formula, but a set of rules for crafting melody against melody.  Disonance has to be approached by stepwise motion, repeated skips should be avoided while favoring fluid motion.  Melodies should avoid parallel motion and favor contrary motion where ever possible.  Parallel fifths and octaves are right out.  Sopranno voices can start on the root or fifth, while bass melodies must start on the root.  The last two notes either need to end on a 3 to 1 interval or a 6 to 8.  Then there are the species.

I - single note against single note

II - two notes against one

III - four notes agains one

IV - Suspensions, suspensions, suspensions

V - a combination of the previous four.

Pick a melody line to practice against, it's called the cantus firmus (or immovable melody) and you should practice writing both a sopranno line and bass in all species until you are familiar with the rules.

Strict counter point is when you follow all of the rules to the letter.

It*is* something else. It's a clarification of tritone subs on a subreddit that discusses them often and misunderstands them almost as often. The rhetorical nature of my title must have confused you.

&gt;It's weird that you think it would be different. No matter how many instruments you break it up between, it will sound fully diminished.

Same reason I think that you can hear a melody, a counter melody and a bassline separately even if they're harmonically derived from the same chord. The chromatic movement of Dm7-Db7-CM7 is very distinct and the riffs and voice leading derived from it reflect that. 

Db7/G7 also wouldn't sound fully diminished even as a compound chord played by a single instrument. It has a major third and a minor seventh in it. The additional notes from Db7 are just the b9 and #11 of G7. It's still just a dominant chord but with extensions.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-27 03:59:48 Beastintheomlet<br>Basslines are really the defining aspect that says what a chord is. 

For example, if you're playing a C major chord of a C in the bass you have a C major chord. But if you play an A in the bass under a C major chord it's not C major anymore, it's Am7. You can completely reharmonize a chord progression with the bass alone, it's what makes it so powerful in composing. 

Rhythm is also really important, a stagnant bassline that just follows a chord progression will sound bland. In rock music it's common to sync the bass with the kick drum to give it more of a locked in feeling. In jazz the bass will walk, meaning playing a moving bassline that arpegiates the chord, or leads into the next chord. It's also common for the bass to be a counter melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-27 04:05:21 s-multicellular<br>&gt; if I have a chord progression in key of C major I should be able to create a bassline using the notes C D E F G A B C? 

Yes, that generally should work. 

More specifically, I'd say, timbre/frequency spectral spread being in normal ranges:

* if you have a chord playing, the root of that chord should work. 
* A 5th up from the root or 4th down from the root will usually work with a bit of a more nuanced sound, can sometimes makes things feel like an inversion (arguably becomes an inversion but that's just notation v psycho-harmonics imho)
* the third of the chord in the bass causes some sense of tension. Are we at a point of not sounding good? I don't know, you see these sometimes and I don't think they wildly jump out at you. 
* Anything else is a definite tension and really becomes a more *aligned* notation/psycho-harmonic question as to what the chord is. However, a lot of bass parts start on the root or 5th/4th and having 'passing' or 'walking' notes that hit others and those short-lived tensions can provide a lot of glue, movement, or even a counter-melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-02 22:09:29 Jongtr<br>&gt; do professional musicians use the words "masculine" and "feminine" to describe polar opposites of a certain audible spectrum? 

Never met any that do.   

Obviously there are associations with vocal register in that men's voices are generally deeper than women's (or pre-pubescent boys).   

So it certainly happens that in singing, a high male voice - especially falsetto or counter-tenor - can be considered to sound "feminine", while a low contralto female voice might be considered to sound "masculine".   Not entirely in either case, of course, because a lot also depends on timbre.

This vocal association does transfer to instrumental melody.  IMO we subconsciously (or consciously) respond to instrumental melody as we would to a human voice.  Good melodies tend to make us want to sing along, to join our voice to the instrument.    Melody is loosely analogous to speech, in the way it forms phrases with apparent logic.

Moreover, in both genders, there is psychological meaning at the extremes of register.  Very high register easily connotes passion of various kinds - when loud, fear, anger, despair, total involvement; when soft, sad, gentle or intimate.  In pop music, the effect of high male tenor voice is especially valued for its emotional expressiveness, at all dynamics.  It may be because, in our society, men are supposed to be tough, "strong and silent", keeping emotion under control, deep-voiced if speaking at all - so to sing in a high voice demonstrates an appealing dropping of those barriers: men displaying emotion.  It's no accident that the standard male register in rock music is a high tenor, with plenty of screaming - and is often associated with androgynous stage personae.   It appeals to both men and women: allowing men an arena for emotional self-expression - the "peacock" - and letting women see a man as sensitive and vulnerable. (The fact it's all fake, or formulaic, is just art of the theatre.)

Low voices, on the other hand, at least in men, have a different kind of intimacy, at least in popular music.  They are "sexy" in a different way from the Marvin Gayes or Axl Roses.  They can be both gruff (appealing nonchalant), or  deliberately seductive.

Naturally, the ranges of musical instruments greatly exceed human vocal ranges, by a couple of octaves in either direction, simply because we are capable of perceiving pitch across that 7+ octave range (while middle C is a central point in human vocal ranges too).   So when sounds exceed the voice, they begin to have other meaning, associated with the natural world, or perhaps with animal or bird voices.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-13 01:50:00 FIndia<br>As a pure dabbler without firm feet neither in Western nor in Indian music theory, here's my understanding:


When we say Raga, we can either refer to the North Indian variants (the second link) or the South Indian ones (the first link). They share almost nothing in common. Then there are subcategories within these regions that come from various schools of oral tradition. A bit like discussing pasta preparations across Italy, everyone has their own interpretation that they swear by. Ragas were largely taught as oral tradition, with little to no notation or documentation. Much like conductors piloting an orchestra, each school-of-thought (literally) had their own way of interpreting a Raga's theme with regards to mood/tone/timbre/tempo. 


1. Sa-Pa-Sa (Do-So-Do an octave above) is the most common tonal center one begins with. It is "immovable", in the sense that a Perfect Fifth is immovable. It's taught to help develop an understanding of pitch and intervals. However, some caveats:
&gt; We abandon any ideas of A=440 or Middle C, because these concepts don't exist. Instruments (including percussion) get tuned to accommodate the range and desired timbre of the vocalist, or in the case of no singer, get tuned "to taste" — the "lead instrument" tunes up to how they feel the instrument sounds best for that particular performance and the rest tune relative to it.
&gt; If I were to approach it on guitar, my best approximation would be fretless/slide, with a Wah. This helps with microtonality and intonation, as well as with tone of note.
&gt; You will rarely, if ever, come across any chordal voicings. Sympathetic strings that resonate, sure, but no 1-3-5 chords.


2. Ragas can be highly idiosyncratic and the only way to learn them is to, well, practice! 
&gt; The simplest Ragas can be thought of like your regular pentatonic runs, no different. There are others you'll encounter where even within that pentatonic, you are obligated to emphasise certain notes, but not others. Certain "key" notes are meant to be played louder, held longer but not the others. Failing to do so dilutes the Raga completely. Then there are still others where if you're ascending in pitch, you can *only* hit some of the notes in the "scale" but not others, and when descending you have other notes to hit. If that isn't enough, certain Ragas are meant to be played *only* at certain periods of the day viz. Dawn, Morning, Evening, Dusk, Night.


3. Did you mean something like relative major/minor? The concept doesn't exist. Two Ragas cannot/do not contain the same notes. There can only be one Raga in C Major, in that there can only be one Raga with exactly these 7 notes. You can however have a C Pentatonic Raga, but again, just one of those and is treated entirely uniquely, distinct from the C Major Raga. 
&gt; Since the concept of C doesn't exist to begin with, we can well dispense with Maj/Min scales and modes and so on. You do have enharmonic notation, though it serves a similar function as in western music. Your *Sa* (Do) is your tonic, with no fixed corresponding note/frequency. Start wherever you please, and intonate your intervals relatively.
&gt; Ragas are in that sense Canonical in nature. To the best of my knowledge, you can't / there isn't a Raga with four or fewer notes. It needs a minimum of five. All unique combinations of flats/natural/sharps and 5-6-7 notes and so on have been codified as individual Ragas leaving no new ragas for us to compose (in the strict sense, anyway).


What seems counter-intuitive is that Ragas are meant to be improvisational — no two performances are alike! The ensembles are the jam-bands of Indian classical music. It isn't uncommon to sit through a 90-min performance only to realise that the gang were just warming up. The Raga starts with a motif/leitmotif, cluing everyone in about what's to follow. The theme gets expanded on, but never too out-of-control; they'll make periodic visits back to the original motif. (It's at this time some clueless people like me start to clap thinking it's over, but no!). Everyone gets a 10min-15min solo, so there goes the better part of an hour. Rhythm and tempo is another kettle of fish. Percussive melody + compound / odd / irrational meters + call and response, and the percussionist "singing rhythmically". (This is also when people take their pee &amp; tea breaks). 

Chances are you'll get back in time to witness the final 10mins of them wrapping up their Raga — ending right where they began, at the Sa.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-23 21:48:45 s-multicellular<br>I couldn't say what is a theoretical rule, but as someone that long played bass, I think my collected feedback from collaborators (band mates, recording mates) may be helpful. 

Rhythmically: 

The bass is partly part of the percussion section. A a bass player, the minimum I'd need to know to play something decent would be the key sig and where the kick and snare where hitting. There are lots of great examples of electronic bass where, with filter automation or velocity control, the bass acts as an alternative to kick and snare perceptually. Think the bass part in the verses of NIN - Closer. That's a very common beat you'd hear on kick and snare. 

Harmonically:

Bassically, I think about two types of song parts: chord structured and riff structured (you could in a sense say counter-point, but that terms isn't much used and is slightly different conceptually)

Where you have a chord structured part, i.e. a clear chord progression, the bass is usually going to be on roots *most* of the time. 'Most' is important because that will vary stylistically with the song. A sparse arrangement, you may have more freedom. A complex key, e.g. my band has a song in a hungarian minor, you play something other than a root and it may be perceived as a wrong note! A lot of great bass parts in chorded structures have transitional notes bridging the chord changes. A lot add an added sense of movement with a common simple arpegiation. 

With a riff structure, it depends a bit on who is playing the riff. Sometimes it is the bass e.g. RHCP Give it Away. If not, near-doubling the riff with some simplification is common and often nicely helpful to add strength. Otherwise I hear a lot where the bass will go far from doubling and accent the main percussion elements. Then you also have examples where the vocal melody moves more than the riff and the bass actually forcibly adds a chord structure. Listen closely to Temple of the Dog's Hunger Strike, the guitar is hanging out on this Em, G, arp and the bass is actually turning it effectively into other chords adding, sometimes a C, sometimes an A.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-23 22:38:28 Beastintheomlet<br>I think it's best to view the bass as being the glue between the guitar/piano and the drums. When you listen to music like focus on how the bass interlocks with the drums and then listen to how it plays with the harmony. Bass has a really important roll with making everything feel like a single unit. 

As far as writting bass remember that it is the final deciding factor of what chord is being played and controls the momentum. So harmonically, if the piano plays a chord progression of C major - G major - F major - G major it'll sound like I-V-IV-V and very major. But if you add the bass notes A-G-D-E under those chord we now hear the very same piano part as Am7-G-Dm7-Em7, or i^(7)-VII-iv^(7)-v^(7) which is definitely minor. 


In terms of momentum, even if only playing the root of the chord the rhythm and subdivision the bass is playing has a major impact on the feel of the song. A bass playing half notes vs eighth notes have very different implications for the song. 

The bass can also be used to smooth out transitions between chords by walking or ascending/descending to the next chords root note. It can be used to play a riff/ostinato that the rest of the music plays around with. The bassline can also act as a counter melody to the main melody.

The last thing I'll say is that bass is frequently under utilized in a lot of genres and styles, but it's a very powerful element of any song.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-24 02:29:29 Beastintheomlet<br>One of the hallmark sounds of Punk and Metal is pretty thick distortion and generally speaking the heavier the distortion the more basic your chords need to be. 7th chords just flat out do not sound the same through heavy distortion, even triads can get pretty muddy which is why the heavier sides of rock like punk and metal use almost exclusively power chords on guitar (only the root and the fifth). 

As far as adding spice both punk and metal would have different avenues. Punk really doesn't add spice, it's ethos and structure is taking elements of pop and distilling them down to their absolute basic components. You can really here this distillations when you listen punk covers of pop songs, the band Me First and The Gimme Gimmes are a great example of how punk covers can really distill this down. If jazz is KFC with 11 herbs and spices punk rock is a bowl of cereal, and you don't really add hot sauce to cereal. If anything punk rock adds interest (a better way to frame it in my opinon) reductively. It'll start the song as bare bones as possible and then add small differents to build interest. The verse or begining of the song will be slower in terms of subdivisions (strumming in 8th notes instead of 16ths) or the guitar part will be muted which let's you play wide open later for contrast. 

Metal would spice things with ornamentation, typically the harmony/chord progression would also be heavily distorted power chords but there is typically a lead guitar part as well that acts to add color to the harmony, do call and response with the melody or act as counter melody. 

For both Punk and Metal you really can't overlook your rhythm section either, tactful movement and contrast on bass and true finesse even at fast tempos on drums are truly one of the biggest aspects that separates the mediocre from the great in those genres.

1. Use chords other than in root position. For instance that second chord: play it as (bottom-to-top) e-g-c, then you have a counter-melody d-c-b in the left hand. Et cetera.
2. Repeat motifs. The listener needs something to latch onto.
3. Think in terms of phrases that come from something and go to something. For instance, if your piece is in G, make sure that phrases start and end in G. Or have phrase one start in G, end in D, and phrase two go from D to G.

That's kind of like saying, though, that Training Wheels are important for those wanting to get right into bike riding.

Maybe that's true to an extent as most of us need those training wheels. But I think it's important to take them off at some point - i.e. learn "real" theory. So don't use the "chord progressions" thing as a crutch, security blanket, or training wheels for too long!

&gt; 
&gt; Oh and please explain what you guys mean by "lines" in melody..

A melody is basically a "line" - when we hear notes that are following other notes in close horizontal proximity, we tend to hear each successive note as "following" or "coming after" the previous note, and thus the previous note as "leading into" the next note - so there's a "connection" between each note of a melody - think of each note of a melody as a dot or "point" (that's part of where counter*point* comes from) and if you were to draw lines connecting points you've have a graph of sorts that was more horizontal than vertical - a "line".

C - E - F - G - F - D - C - B - C is a "linear" melody - and it's likely if we heard those notes in order in a piece of music (without too much time elapsing between them) we'd hear them as a "unit" - a "line" or a musical sentence if you like.

Instead, harmony is vertical rather than horizontal - so 3 notes stacked up that form a chord is a more "vertical" concept.

When you write a melody with chords, you basically get something like this:

. . . . . . . .
|  |  |  |  |

Thought the melody line (in dots) would move up and down a bit typically as might the chords).

Here's a better representation:

https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/musical_texture.png

(the bass "line" here is called that because it too is more melodic and linear in nature than the chords that the guitar is playing).

It's usually just something that composers really drill because it can be difficult to master, but it's mixed in with all other sorts of compositional techniques.

Thanks for your time. Yes, sorry, I probably wasn't very clear. I appreciate it's a technique, but perhaps I'm hung up on the style presented in tutorials. 

So homophony – melody and chords beneath – is one texture. But I guess I'm interested in how these chords are exploded into different counter melodies, complementary harmony phrases, etc. when arranged for ensemble. 

I guess this is where I'm overthinking things, right? It's the basic process of composition, and it uses counterpoint as a technique to do so – it's just a different stylistic application of the technique compared to, say, a fugue.

Many different ways.

One of my favorites is "throw \*\*\*\* at the wall and see if it sticks". Basically, I compose a piece very quickly, play some instrumental bits, stitch on parts as needed, do a quick mix and master in the DAW and check it out the next day to see if I like it.

It sounds counter-intuitive, because we often think of the creative process as "genius at work". There should be patience, insight, deliberation and great effort. And while I do think those things are important, what this technique does is that it stops you from questioning yourself, you're just running with your ideas.

As for what I start with, that varies. Starting with structure is good because it is the easiest, but it is also the one where I find it easiest to fall into tropes or common ground. That isn't always bad, but if you're looking for that "eureka" moment, I don't think it is the best. Starting with harmony makes it easy to fit instruments and sections into the piece, but I often find that that the melody will become a bit more bland, as it is so easy to just let the harmony talk. Starting with melody is the easiest idea-wise, but often I find it the hardest composing-wise - but it is also here I suspect music theory can be at its most rewarding (I'm still very much novice) as it can probably give you a lot of knowledge about what structures or harmonies could fit.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-01-02 22:03:15 tdammers<br>Let's see...

- **Improvisation is just realtime composition.** (Or: composition is just improvisation with time travel).
- **Practice is more important than theory. If in doubt, your ears are right and your rational brain is wrong.** Theory is descriptive, not prescriptive; if it sounds good, and does the trick, then it's good, no matter how many "rules" or "laws" it violates. Theory can show the way to unexpected stuff that sounds good, theory can explain *why* something sounds good, and how to replicate a similar sound, but if the theory says "do this" and it sounds bad, then the theory is at fault, not your ears. A key moment in my musical career was when I sat down at the piano and just started hitting arbitrary keys, merely trying to keep notes approximately thirds and fourths apart, and with good jazz timing and phrasing. The result was perfectly convincing jazz comping, and if, say, a sax player had walked in and just played random jazz phrases, it would have sounded as if we knew what we were doing. This was a truly liberating experience, because it made me realize immediately how it's not at all about the rational side of things, it's about the intent, the message, the energy you project. Which leads us to:
- **Music is a form of communication.** It's like language, except the message you're conveying cannot be fully captured in words (which is why we need music in the first place). No matter what you do, it's ultimately about the message. Let your music speak, touch some souls, everything else is just a means to that end.
- **Music theory is relative.** There is no such thing as a "universal theory of music"; there are only theories that describe particular musical idioms. Applying a theory to an idiom it wasn't designed for just leads to disappointment, weirdness, or useless academic brain damage. Particularly, the common practice of trying to explain all sorts of musical idioms from a functional harmony point of view, while disregarding their intrinsic mechanics and conventions, is a bad habit that needs to die. It's cultural elitism, it's not helpful, and it will prevent you from developing a proper intuition for those paradigms. When you're writing voicings for a funk horn section, jazz voice leading doesn't apply (unless you want to make it sound jazzy on purpose) - instead, just two-part harmony doubled in octaves, or even plain old unisons, will often sound much better. For a salsa horn section, keeping the trombones close together (e.g. in thirds), with the trumpets playing a counter-melody in octaves, is about as powerful a sound as you can get, no need for thick "extended" chords. Rock guitars moving in parallel fifths with the bass and the vocals is perfectly fine, very common, and completely idiomatic; avoiding parallel fifths in rock music is just silly. In pop music, not every chord needs a 7th, and mindlessly adding major 7ths and 9ths and 13ths and stuff to all chords will more likely make it sound worse than better (unless, again, you're going for a "jazz" kind of sound). There is no such thing as a "blues scale"; blues melody follows different laws than functional harmony based scale theory, and its relationship to the chords is different. (Although "jazz blues", where you take a blues chord progression and play it in functional harmony / scale theory style, is a thing, and so is using blues melody mechanisms in compositions that aren't blues).
- **It all starts with the voice and the drum.** These are what we evolved to use and listen to, and all other instruments are imitations of these two in one way or another.
- **Less is more.** As someone smarter than myself put it: "You're not done when there's nothing more to add. You're done when there's nothing left that can be taken away."
- **Read "Effortless Mastery".** Or, if you can't be arsed, meditate on this saying: "Fear not the warrior who has studied 1000 moves. Fear the warrior who has studied one move 1000 times." There's always more to learn, more to explore, more to put into your music, but you have to work with what you currently have available. And when it comes down to it, you get the best benefit out of those things that you have truly mastered, the things that you can do in your sleep; a dozen of those is worth more than 10,000 licks that you can't *quite* execute perfectly.
- **We are not just musicians.** We are stage performers - actors, musicians, dancers, it's all just different aspects of the same thing. We are humans on a stage, we can be seen and heard, we make noise, we move in a space, we face the audience, we communicate. Use this to your advantage. Practice how you move on stage. Practice how to speak on stage. Be mindful of what you do while you're not playing. Be mindful of your body language while playing. Mind the audience. Mind your fellow stage artists. Communicate.
- **Separate thinking from doing.** Don't try to do both at the same time. You can't. When performing, don't think, just do. When practicing, alternate thinking and doing: think what you want to achieve, get into a deep focus, then do it, and *then* evaluate. Don't plan or evaluate while doing it; limit your thinking while playing to no more than one thing to focus on. It helps to record your practice sessions for this purpose.

Somewhere around the 1 minute mark you have a clear melody that's supposed to sound festive, but it's kinda tame. You put it fairly low in all the woodwinds. Taking it up by an octave in the flutes is entirely possible, and even an occasional run to the high C and D is possible. The piccolo is definitely low. Also: that melody is everyone in unison which sounds thin. I would try some counter-melody. For instance under g-g-g-a-a-a-b I would do g-f#-f#-f#-e-e-d. Both dissonance and contrary motion to make it a little more interesting.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-01-17 04:45:45 LikeThatChesireCat<br>So many reasons! Combining different instruments together can create a new and interesting timber, for sure. It can also be about power- just the trombones vs. ALL of the brass creates a much more powerful statement. You can use doubling to create a layered effect by having doubled instruments slowly join the chord or phrase. Don't forget to consider that some instruments are inherently louder than others; if your trumpets have the theme and you want your flutes to have the counter melody, you'd likely find they aren't loud enough to be heard on their own and would need to paired with other woodwind instruments.  If a live group were to play the music, you might want to consider that having any given group resting for extended periods of time is unideal.

Now, I'm a middle school band teacher and there's a whole host of other reasons to include doubling in pieces written for school bands. If you have a small school or are in a less wealthy district, you might not have every instrument covered. You'd find many groups don't have some of the instruments that are more uncommon or expensive, such as oboe, bassoon, bass clarinet, tuba, and french horn (though it varies a lot and some groups find themselves without the more "common" instruments).  And if you do have an oboe or tuba, they may not be a strong enough player to be able to play the line by themselves, or feel comfortable with that. We do our best to avoid these pieces unless we find ourselves with a particularly strong and confidant player.  I know you're asking about video game music but knowing this can be helpful for your composing regardless, and could be a fun challenge to write with a band in mind! Or if you have a fun theme that doesn't work out.... we always need new music, teaching the same thing over and over is never fun! 

As far as clashing instruments, you might find if you're composing using musescore, noteflight, or a different midi software that plays back a computer generated instrument that it'll sound like it's clashing, but so long as it really is the same note it's going to be ugly because it's midi. It won't sound like that with real instruments (and not, say an F and an F#, which will definitly clash. Not sure of your ability level or knowledge, but remember transposing instruments! A 'C' on flute is not a 'C' on clarinet!). Enjoy learning orchestration!

I question his assessment on Paul McCartney's bass playing given that Paul is considered one of the best on that instrument.  Also there is much difficulty exhibited in singing while playing a counter-melody.  Also, I am not certain, but didn't most of the Beatles find Let It Be one of their worst albums?

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-01-21 02:25:50 machinedlens<br>They aren’t sfx but rather simply a vocal line (without using words).  You could call it a vocal harmony.  When something like this is improvised you might here jazz musicians call it “long tones” - especially if it were an improvised melody (that acts as backing / harmony / counter melody) under a melody or solo.  However I’ve only heard it called that (or called it that myself - I’m a jazz pianist / composer) when it’s a horn player (or another instrumentalist).  The idea being that everyone is playing a standard without any arrangement or score so when a non rhythm section player isn’t playing a melody or soloing, instead of just sitting there listening, he or she can just improvise some long tones (usually diatonic / chordal notes that move stepwise - as if if were part of a pre-composed arrangement) to add extra harmony / sonority to a song.  That cliche is kind of what you’re describing in the example.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-01-25 04:19:44 65TwinReverbRI<br>Yeah, that's one of those things that's kind of counter-intuitive because we often play so much solo stuff we need that bass note or octave in the bass (and such a common thing to do).

One thing that can help quickly is to just put the "bass" note up in a higher octave - if you see Am7 for example, don't play the A below the bass staff or the one on the first space with the octave below it - or it by itself even. Play the A right below middle C.

One common strategy for many keyboardists is to basically play a Triad in the RH and the root/bass note in the LH - so if you see Am7 you would play a "C" chord with your RH, and then an A somewhere below.

If you start by playing the low A up as high below your C structure as you can, then the "C" chord above for you Am7.

Once you get used to doing it and seeing it in this register, you can start doing things like moving the A up into the C chord, above it, or leaving it out.

IOW, the 3-5-7 of the chord kind of become your landmark - familiar triad inversions of C - C-E-G, E-G-C, and G-C-E (last is often a favorite) with the A below it, in it, or above it - A-C-E-G, A-E-G-C, A-G-C-E, or C-E-G-A, E-G-A-C, G-A-C-E, or E-G-C-A, G-C-E-A, and C-E-G-A and thing like that (and you can drop the A because the bass has it as well).

One other thing that's a good starting point is to go ahead and play the Bass note in the lower octave but put a 7th above it, meaning you play a 3 and 5 above ("/" for LH/RH break):

A-G / C-E or A-G / E-C.

The first one is actually what I was saying above (the common one) but now the LH is playing the A and G, while the RH does the C and E (it could also do any other duplicates of all notes if you wanted).

The main difference here is that the previous set I mention all are sort of "Triad in closed position in the RH" with the bass note in the LH, while this new set is see more as "7th in the LH with remaining notes (and any duplicates) in the RH, but only the first example has the close position triad - the 2nd one is an open position triad. Which brings us to:

Another strategy is to play an open 5th in the LH, and the rest in the RH, usually also a 4th or 5th:

A-E / C-G or A-E / G-C

Here the 2nd example is on of those first kinds mentioned initially again - the triad part in close position, but the other voicing is open.

The advantage for keyboardists for kind of conceptualizing them this way is once you start getting used to seeing "4th/5th in LH and 4th/5th in RH" for a 7th chord like this, you begin to more quickly see possibilities like:

E - A / G - C - which you really wouldn't get with any of the instances before. IOW if you know A and E can be in the LH, you can have them in either order, same with the two RH notes. That gives you yet again once of the first instances:

A-E / G-C (close position C triad on top) but it also gives you E-A / C-G and E-A / G-C, neither of which gives you a "consistent interval" type voicing - a mix of close and open position chords or parts of chords.

Obviously really it should all about the sound you want your voicing to have - open, or close, or mixed, and with the root/bass on the bottom (even if high) or not.

Here's an interesting tidbit from classical music: As a general rule, in piano music, you rarely see a triad lower than about bass clef C (C-E-G) outside of a special effect (really loud ending chord, etc.).

Bass generally covers a range *under* the bass clef staff - even its open G string is still the first line on the Bass Clef staff.

So, if you have your LH above that, you're generally in decent shape.

Unless you specifically want higher voicing for sound, sparkle, tinkle, or whatever, I would say the further your lowest note goes down, the farther it needs to be from the next lower note - so if you play an A in the first space with your LH, one of those voicings with the 7th in the LH would be better. If you play an E as your lowest note, then the A above it (a 4th) for an Am7 chord would be about as close as you'd want (probably not E-G-A-C in other words). If your lowest note is G in the top space, you could get away with G-A-C-E, but even A-C-E-G would be better. You can always have more space - E-C-G-A, or G-C-E-A, or A-G-C-E for example.

I would say you wouldn't really want your "C triad in close position" if playing it that way to be any lower than about G below the treble staff. Obviously RH often plays above middle C in general anyway, but sometimes the logical voicing of chords can lead you to lower notes. Is also depends on how much you need to stay out of the way of something on top as well - male vocalist, sax, etc.

Finally, the "less is more" approach should NOT be under-rated.

There's a guitarist named Vivian Campbell who is an amazing guitarist that use to play in Dio in the 1980s. He's now touring with Def Leppard and he's basically play very very simple rhythm guitar parts. I keep thinking, man, he's making scads of money for a really easy gig - he doesn't even have to work at it.

IT IS OK TO LAY OUT SOMETIMES!!!!!!!

It's ok to play one note. Double the melody. just play a few accented "hits" here and there - sparse can be OK too. Don't feel like you have to "carry" the ensemble.

I've always played in rock groups - trios, quartets - where I have to "carry" the harmony - play all the chords. There are in fact some rock songs with a prominent lead thing you have to leave out because if you do, the backing chords go away and they're more important. So you always have this feeling you have to "play it all" - as a matter of fact, we're often called on to play two guitar parts by ourselves and have to figure out ways to make that work too. So you kind of get into this mindset of overplaying and "carrying everything".

Once I got the opportunity to play with a Horn band - 3 horns, keys, bass, drums - I got lost reading the chart at one point and they were playing along and I realized, wow, I don't HAVE to play - the song's not going to fall apart if I don't play - which honestly was a welcome relief and the world off my shoulders. I play many gigs now where I simply don't play on an entire song sometimes - or sometimes just put in one section or something. The way I see it is, "easy money". I'm doing my job :-)

If you get a chance during rehearsal, take a step back and just listen - see what it sounds like without you, and then think about what you can add that doesn't "muddy things up". Obviously your instructor is going to want you to play and not just lay out the whole time, but try playing a game with yourself - "how lazy can I be and get away with this" :-D I'm not condoning that attitude all the time, but here's a great place where, "Work smarter not harder" comes into play.

Obviously, if you can work with a Jazz pianist who's familiar with big band and combo playing, that would be a great thing - you ought to consider some lessons from someone around town who does that stuff. Also, listen to others doing it and try to figure out what they do.

If all else fails, sit on your LH and only play with your RH - it's school it's not a paid position, you won't get half salary if you only play with one hand :-D.

Good luck.

You have to approach it with the mindset of making a song, rather than a “beat”, sample, loop, whatever you want to call it. Every 8 measures you need to change something. You need to fluctuate energy too. Maybe introduce a counter melody after the intro, then after that, scale back to a single instrument for a break. Shit like that.

Building chords... Creating lines of melody that counter each other (sound unique). Yes, any bit of knowledge will help!!

You wouldn't go exploring without a map, and if you become an expert explorer you're going to make a map anyways, so why not learn how to read one?

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-03 19:50:45 goodgamin<br>A lot of the juiciness comes from the beauty of the chord progressions themselves. Also from the dreamy timbres that were chosen. 

As for the clarity, how to make it lush without creating mud, every fill chord, every counter-melody comes out of the chord structure at that moment. The specific notes of the chord tell you what the possibilities are for counter-lines, etc.

There's more than one way to learn how to write good counter-lines. A few possibilities: 1) listen to lots of examples and write down the counter-lines 2) practice improvising on your instrument in that style 3) study counterpoint (there's a good book on this called Gradus Ad Parnassum published by  W. W. Norton)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-07 05:34:24 tdammers<br>Welcome to the creative arts. This is normal, and it won't go away. Composing is hard, and it will remain hard forever.

That said, there isn't really anything special about jazz, but I suspect you have a slightly suboptimal idea of what "composing" looks like. Finale is a nice tool and all, but composition, especially in jazz music, isn't about your music notation software. It's about making music. So I'd start with that, and make a habit of composing either in your head (if you can), or on an instrument that you are deeply comfortable with. If you're a pianist, then that's super convenient, but if not, you can still compose on your instrument of choice (and you should probably look into learning at least some rudimentary piano skills).

Then; composition is as technical as it is creative. Just like playing an instrument requires technique, so does composition. If you want to compose jazz music, you need to learn how jazz music works. What kind of forms do jazz composers use? How does jazz harmony work? What kind of chord progressions sound good? How do jazz composers go about developing melodic ideas? How does one harmonize those?

So let's say you have this melodic line. You like it, it's a good line. It's two measures long. We want something longer - but we don't need to develop any completely new material for that. Instead, we develop the melody.

So the first thing you do is you play that melodic idea - in its pure form at first, but then start fooling around with it. Transpose it, shift it up and down the key, change its mode, change the rhythm, add embellishments, try different continuations, play it backwards, upside down, faster, slower, cut it in half, insert something else, prepend something, invent a counter-melody to go with it, then develop that, etc. etc. You have literally millions of options; but don't decide yet, just explore.

At the same time, try to get a feel for the kind of harmony that goes with that idea, and what kind of general harmonic movement you want. This should also be linked to a form - e.g., you could make it a blues, or an AABA form, or ABAB, or something less commonplace. Try different ways of harmonizing your idea and some of its developments.

This is a process that can easily take days, sometimes months. That's OK, your brain needs time to process this stuff in the background. As the piece matures in your brain, and you keep playing with it, it will eventually solidify, and slowly approach its final form. Try not to think too much in terms of instrumentation or specific style at this point; keep it simple. You want to arrive at the tune in its purest possible form before arranging it for a given ensemble. If it's suitable for playing with a piano trio, or maybe just voice and piano (or a melody instrument and piano), or even just piano alone, then you're at least close.

And **now** you go and break out the Finale. Maybe. Or you just hand-write the leadsheet.

And then when you have the tune in its pure, raw form, think about instrumentation / arrangement. If you need one, that is. Quite often you don't - you just hand out the leadsheet, and people will more or less know what to do with it. Just need to transpose it for those sax and trumpet players.

One final note: that "vision in your head" can be deceptive. More often than not, I imagined things to sound mind blowingly great, but when I finally sat down and wrote them down, they didn't sound great at all. And at the same time, some of the best things I ever wrote happened by accident.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-13 11:00:05 Beastintheomlet<br>It’s really about movement of the bass in most cases. Say you’re chords are C - G - Am - F, the classic four chord progression. If you play the G chord with B on the bottom as G/B you’re lowest note in each chord now walks down down from C to F, giving the bass a smooth line. Take those same chords but play them C - G/D - Am/E - F. Now our baseline is ascending, we’re climbing our way up that F, and even the chords are the same notes it has a much different tone and context. 

Those are two of the most common bass lines where you’d use slash chords, there are other ways but *generally* they’re really about the contour of the bass line. 

Don’t forget the bass line often acts as a counter melody, when the main melody is resting, static or holding a note it’s common to have the bass approach the next chord or have a little run to fill in that space.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-13 20:33:45 fasti-au<br>It’s a mostly ignorable thing for players.  Writers will use details like what chord can I move to using the same colour notes I’m singing etc but in general it’s not a thing that is required but does lead to deeper understanding of theory if you want to go into that rabbit hole.   

What you probably want to look at more is what are the resolutions   Dominants sub dominants etc.   and inversions whic is how do I play the same chords with different shapes.    I like to think of it like a hamburger.  The meat of a chord is the 1. The normal resolution is a 5-1 that’s where it wants to go so anytime you write a 5-1 combo it feels like you have finished a sentence.   If your singer is doing a 5-1 then you can’t really play a 2-4-6 chord as they will likely clash.   

Knowing the notes in a chord as numbers is good because you can write chords to the melody or counter melody.  

Just saying that understanding the cinematically feelings caused by then changes between chords is what the colours are in relation to the circle.  


TLDR. Ignore the circle Learn about how chords resolve and it will make it appear to make sense
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-16 01:36:01 tdammers<br>The ultimate guide are your ears - if it sounds good, then it is good. There are no "rules" beyond that; all the theory in the world is there to help you discover stuff that works, not to tell you what to do and what not to.

So basically, just grab your favorite instrument and try things out. Singing works well, too.

A couple of tips to keep you productive:

- You don't need a lot of ideas, or even great ideas, to write a great melody. Don't be too picky, don't try to cram a lot of ideas into your melody, and don't be afraid to run out of material. Keep it simple, work with what you have, learn to "develop" your material.
- Speaking of development: practice melodic development. Learn the basic concepts, but don't take them too academically: e.g., explore what happens when you play a melody twice, three times, for times in a row; play it backwards; flip it upside down (same intervals, but invert the directions); transpose it into a different key; shift it up and down the scale (e.g. if your melody is in C major, and starts on E, move it up so that it still uses the notes of C major, but starts on F; or on G; or A, etc.); cut it in half and come up with a different continuation for the first half; come up with a different beginning for the second half; repeat only the second half; write a harmony voice or a counter-voice; develop that counter voice as its own melody; etc. etc. etc.
- Learn to kill your darlings. If you have concluded that the melodic material you're working with doesn't work out, don't be afraid to toss it. You can always come up with a new one. I promise.
- To get yourself out of the comfort zone, or to break that "writer's block", force yourself to work with melodies created by a roll of a dice. Or by jotting random ink blots on an empty sheet of score paper, and then adding accidentals and stems and ties and stuff without worrying about the sound; then just play that random stuff and keep what you like. You'll be surprised.
- Start with lyrics. Write a poem, or pick an existing one, and write a melody that follows the rhythm and diction of that poem.
- Don't worry about the chords just yet; a good melody has its own internal flow, and you can harmonize it in many ways.
- Don't break out the score paper or the DAW just yet. These things can be great composition aids, but they can also be huge distractions, and they have the power to paralyze you with choice. Stick with a simple instrument that you are familiar with, and compose without your technical abilities.
- Remember that composition is all about making choices; and because you have limited decision making capacity, it helps to set yourself constraints to reduce the number of choices to be made. This way, you can dedicate your full attention to these choices and make each of them count, rather than just half-assing all of them. For example, try making a melody using only three different pitches. Now instead of 12 options for each note, you only have 3. Much much easier.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-18 03:18:10 RajinIII<br>Start looking into counter point at least for a bit. Western harmony comes from counter point. Everything started out with just 2 melodies and how they interacted. Composer started adding more melodies and then our system of harmony started developing.

Also in Western music it's generally accepted that a melody will imply some sort of harmony. There's multiple ways to harmonize any melody, but a melody will generally give you a place to start. You can always get more creative with it. Reharmonization is the practice of all the different ways you can harmonize a melody generally in less obvious ways
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-27 08:44:32 ThePerpetualGamer<br>Basically any generic concert band piece is going to have a melody somewhere in the band with a counter melody in the horns, at least. It's almost a meme to be quite honest.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-28 03:31:03 _gh0stwrit3r_<br>Thanks for your comment. Great advise if I’m going to do more of these ear training exercises!

So I could do for example an ear training starting with one (obvious) instrument and continuously add another instrument. Doubling a melody line, play a counter melody, adding rhythm or playing a chord line.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-11 00:08:23 RajinIII<br>Nice job! There's a lot of very good stuff here. I like the counter point and how you balance the melodic lines against the pads and how the melody jumps around from instrument to instrument. I liked you're modulation and I don't think the midi did your tempo change justice. I also really enjoyed how you used different textures for different parts to change intensity. 

There are so practical concerns about getting a real ensemble to actually play this especially because a lot of the instruments aren't used very often. I think you could use some variation in the drums. I'm not the best with drums either, but try adding in some hits so the drums emphasize important beats in the melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-12 22:31:55 Beastintheomlet<br>Depends on what you want to do with, are you interested in the arrangement and orchestration? Then yeah you'd have to transcribe every instrument but I just listened to Cleric Beast track you mentioned and there's really never more than 4 elements happening at once and they're really just repeating the same thing in different registers. If you're just wanting to make a piano reduction of it or see how it works melodically and harmonically it's really not that dense,  most of the instruments are just harmonizing a held note or melodic line. Take 2:05 thru 2:15, you have the upper vocal part double by violin, it's two instruments but they're doing the same thing. You than the low strings and brass just holding long sustained notes and the male vocal quietly doing a counter melody. It sounds like a lot but really theirs 3 moving parts here.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-17 13:51:56 justnigel<br>Sometimes I start with an existing melody (old hymn books are good for this), write a counter melody to it, then write a counter melody to the counter melody (repeat ad infinitum). When you reach one you like, stop. Fun counterpoint practice.

Another technique is phrase bombing. Churn out 16 fragments a bar or less. Pick the 8 I like best and extend then to two bars. Pick the 4 I like best and write the whole phrase. Pick the two I like best and write an answering phrase. Pick the one I like best and turn it into a piece.

And thirdly, as you suggested, start with a chord progression and improvise/scat until I find something I like that fits over the progression.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-17 15:57:25 tdammers<br>There is no magical recipe, but a few hints that may help:

- Keep it simple. Learn to Kill Your Darlings: it's not done when there is nothing to add, it's done when there is nothing left to remove. One or two ideas are enough, and make for a stronger melody than sixty ideas.
- Learn melodic development techniques. This isn't a magical cure, but having a repertoire of options to explore, kind of like a little checklist for when you're stuck, is tremendously helpful.
- Don't write just a melody, write music. If you're stuck with a melody, try coming up with lyrics, a counter-melody, or chords, or a form, and then try filling in the melody from there. Or if you're doing that, do the opposite, try to develop a melody that has its own internal flow/logic to it, ignoring harmony.
- Toss your ideas around, grind them up, twist and mutilate them, play them until they're coming out your ears, on every instrument you can play, and then also some you can't play. And all the while, keep your ears open for happy little accidents, and be ready to use them too.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-20 00:14:19 Jacobdiaz28<br>Well it all depends on how you aproach it. You could always start with a melody and harmonize it any way you see fit. Or you could take a counter puntal approach. It depends on what youre after.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-20 01:30:50 tdammers<br>Generally, using the same approach to harmony and chord voicing as jazz musicians would.

This means:

- Harmony based on functions, but unlike the classical IV-V-I cadence, jazz prefers ii-V-I (or, in minor, iiø-V-i).
- Sevenths on everything. So the above is actually ii7-V7-Imaj7 (and in minor, iiø7-V7-imaj7).
- Basic voicing strategy: bass walks between root and fifth; above that, you start with third and seventh, and on top of that, "options", picked from 9ths, 11ths and 13ths, as appropriate. This usually creates "wide" voicings, dominated by fourths and fifths, and a few thirds. "Quartal voicings" are also popular, where the "base/upper structure" order is let go in order to voice the entire chord as a stack of fourths. E.g., Dm11 can be voiced, bottom up, as D (bass), then E, A, D, G, C, F. In modal harmony, yet another strategy is to build voicings from triads, often in second inversion, stack one or two fourths above or below, and then move the whole thing up and down the mode (a prime example of this can be heard in "So What"). In general, the piano or guitar will avoid playing the root if a bass is present.
- Make generous use of reharmonization. A very common thing to do is insert borrowed V7 or II-V7's wherever you can make room for them, sometimes even entire chains. Tritone substitution is also very common.
- In addition to functional harmony, jazz also uses blues harmony (characterized by dominant-7 chords on the I, IV and V degrees of the key), modal harmony (longer sections in the same mode, and chords shifting up and down that mode without any strong functional tendency or traditional voice leading), and non-diatonic extensions to harmony such as "Coltrane Changes" (moving in major thirds via borrowed II-V's, e.g. the archetypical Bmaj - Fm7 - Bb7 - Eb etc. in "Giant Steps"), or the Ellington twist (reinterpret the third and seventh of a maj7 chord as the third and seventh of a m7 chord a half step up, e.g. Dmaj7 - Ebm7 - Ab7 - Dbmaj7).
- Another ingredient for bebop and beyond ("modern jazz") is melody. Styles in these eras focus a lot on improvisations, and the improvised melody will often follow the general harmonic direction of the rhythm section, rather than playing along with the exact harmony they're cooking. This means that players will routinely play a lot of notes that run counter to the "official" harmony, up to playing completely "outside".

What you’re asking about has more to do with form. A fugue is a series of imitative entrances, with some other formal aspects, such as a melody and counter-melody. A nocturne is ideally a sort of “duet,” meaning that the right hand is performing a melody harmonized by thirds and sixths (usually), while the left-hand typically performs some sort of arpeggiation as accompaniment. Bach’s music, particularly his fugues, are highly polyphonic, meaning that there are several voices overlapping each other, resulting in a complex form in which the listener is at more liberty to sort of zoom in to follow one voice or out to hear the “whole picture.” A nocturne contrasts starkly with this form, in that it is typically much more lyrical, and thus the focus is directed primarily toward a single (though harmonized) melody.

I tried not to be too technical. I have failed in two ways: I was still too technical, and what I watered down will probably give others an excuse to lambast me. I am ashamed.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-04-11 10:36:03 Chaojidage<br>If you really want to jump into orchestral composition, write a triple grand staff short score and then orchestrate it. The short score need not be playable on the piano. If you've listened to lots of orchestral music and studied enough scores, you'll generally find that in orchestrating any section of the short score, there is a "default" way to do it that you'll instinctively realize. Just imagine the orchestra playing that section, and write down the backbone of what you hear. Then process it more carefully, do the right doubling and hocketing, check fingering, etc.

As an exercise, I suggest writing a piece for triple grand staff short score without using a piano. Like a 2-minute waltz or something. Then orchestrate it for 2+2+2+2 winds, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, 2 trombones, 1 tuba, 1 timpani, 2 percussionists, and strings. No harp, piano, or celesta. You *could* expand the brass section if you need an extra trumpet or something, but let's just pretend you're working with a small orchestra and don't get more parts.

If your college has orchestral readings for the composition students, I suggest, as a project, writing 4 to 5 *contrasting* miniature works like that and having them read by the orchestra. Don't submit a larger piece because then you don't get a chance to diversify your style and thus get diverse feedback. The next year, submit a longer piece.

Chances are, your first pieces will have some unexpected problems. So take advantage of that first reading opportunity to figure out where your weaknesses are. That way you'll do much better the second time around. Perhaps your main issue is the balance of dynamics—that's a common issue since playback on the computer is not faithful to how the dynamics really sound. This can be fixed by taking notes about balance during the reading. Or maybe it's not writing idiomatically for some instruments. In that case, you should talk to the players to figure out why they had trouble, and you should listen to more music featuring the instruments.

Regarding thinking orchestrally, I recommend a general model consisting of the following elements:

* bassline
* high accompaniment
* mid-range accompaniment
* ornamentation
* melody
* counter melody
* doubling lines
* accentuation

This is not from a book or anything; it's just how I think of the orchestra. If you can't give examples of each term, then you should listen to some more orchestral music. Every time you listen to a new piece, by the way, learn at least one thing from it that you can apply in your orchestral writing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-04-11 13:29:27 Dr_Fuzzles<br>I think one of the best ways to start down the road of learning how to write orchestrally is to study orchestration. I agree with others that working on chamber music for the time being will be the most productive for developing your compositional skills, but it’s never a bad idea to start learning about orchestration and getting a feel for how other composers adapt their ideas for a larger orchestral setting.

One of my teachers in grad school had me focus very intensely on writing a chamber piece my first semester with him. When I was finished, we went through and he pointed out all the ways that the piece could be adapted to a large ensemble piece (harmonizing counter-melodies, using doublings to emphasize certain things, etc.) The idea he was trying to impress upon me was, writing for orchestra wasn’t a fundamental change in how I was writing music, I just had to think of the material differently and adapt it to the forces I was writing for.

One of the best ways to go about this is obviously listen to a lot of orchestral music, but more importantly study orchestra scores. Looking at how composers are creating different orchestral colors or using textures will help to understand how their approaching writing for the ensemble. There are also some exercises you can do to better acquaint yourself with a score. Find passages that you like and copy them by hand (it sounds tedious, but it’s great for really understanding how it’s all out together). Also, creating your own 2 or 3 stave reductions of a passage can really help to show the underlying structure of what’s happening in the page (maybe a really complicated-sounding passage is actually just a bassline and melody split between several instruments).

Whenever possible, it can also be helpful to compare a chamber piece to a well-done orchestration, and vice-versa. Comparing Mussorgsky’s original Pictures at an Exhibition to Ravel’s orchestration is a great way of seeing how a master orchestrator’s approach to adaptation. I believe there’s also a piano two-hands version of The Rite of Spring that Stravinsky wrote in addition to the orchestral score. Seeing how expert composers went about adapting the same material for different mediums can give you an idea of how to approach scaling your music up for a larger ensemble.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-04-12 00:25:15 65TwinReverbRI<br>Now, end of that phrase/section:

OK, I'm seeing a pattern here - most of the problems I'm seeing have to do with phrase endings and new sections, and the transition between them. Don't worry, you are not alone - this is one of the hardest things people deal with. It's common when people write 1 section, then another section, the try to put them together and "connect" them.

This piece is "sort of" like that, but because it's more like setting the tune in different accompaniments, it's not quite as bad. But I'm going to come back to this in a minute.

24 is what I'm recommending you should have done back in m.8 (or something similar in 15 and 16).

This "leads into" the next idea nicely.

But, I think it starts a measure too early. 23 should still be the "waltz" pattern.

Going up to the F at the end of 24 then jumping down to that low dyad is problematic again - kind of a big jump down to the LH notes again - both sonically and physically.

Now, of course, it leads right up to the G melody note, which is nice.

But maybe your A melody note doesn't have to be a dotted half, and the RH can pick up the last 2, 3, or 4 notes of this rising line and lead into the melody G, and the LH could even then pick up 2 8ths to lead into the accompaniment pattern in that same pitch range (that chromatic idea might work here as well).

That low G in 23 is weird too - again, a big jump out of nowhere to the lowest note we've had yet. So these two measures - your end of phrase transition measures again - could be re-configured.

Now, 25. The mordent. Kind of cool, and ok. A little unexpected. It's the only one in the piece. So a little inconsistent. So what is its reason for being there.

And I think I know. 

The reason I think your section at 64 is problematic is that it is "yet another accompaniment variation".

In fact, I'm going to say I think you may have instinctively used the mordent at 25 because again, you came to this screeching halt in the LH (especially after that rising 8th note pattern and the things before) and your brain was telling you "I need something happening here" and the rolled chords weren't enough.

I think what you have here is what I said above - these are really cool ideas - most of them. But you're trying to use too many of them in one piece.

Or - and I find this sometimes happens to me - maybe it's the right idea, but at the wrong time in the piece.

I think that you've been through 3 different accompaniment ideas which are "settings". Your main character has just been shown at home, at school, and at work after school, with weird edits between the scenes and some sudden freeze frame shots that don't seem to make sense (or at least change the mood).

I would totally totally just use the accompaniment idea at m.9 here at 25.

I mean it actually makes perfect sense - the running 8th notes in 24 could lead into 2 8ths on the down beat - just "continue across the bar" (maybe like where the scene changes in a movie but the dialogue continues past the edit) to get you into the pattern at 9.

You actually do something like this a 32 which works great.

Also, did you notice what you did in 33 onward - you're using the idea from the opening bit in the LH down an 8ve. Ok that's a much more consistent variation - same material, so familiar, but down an octave, so still fresh.

Also something in 28 and 32 - you had moving notes in the LH with the hold in the RH - so see, that's probably instinctive there, but it's kind of the same thing back in m.8 and why 16 might need some help.

Now, 47 and 48 - great! You kept it going through the next section.

I'm trying to think of film analogies - I think it's a "montage" right - where let's say you show your main character in close up and he's happy, then it cuts to him crying, then cuts to him kind of indifferent, and so on - it's like you're going through these moods pretty quickly.

That's kind of what this is like, but it doesn't feel "right" for this kind of piece. The moods aren't all drastically as different as "ecstatic" and "miserable" but if you were shooting that you probably wouldn't film happy, more happy, somewhat happy, maybe a little more happy than more happy but not quite ecstatic" and that's what going through all these various accompaniment ideas seems like.

If you were to change that area around 25 to what happened back in 9, you'd have this kind of nice A-B-C-B-A idea all the way up through 48 and make it really consistent.

If you hadn't gone back to the A idea at 33 I wouldn't have been surprised if it wasn't yet another variation. Had I heard this and not seen the score I would have probably been going, "oh no, I bet another variation is coming".

So I'm glad it didn't, but the following sections do continue to do this.

I LOVE the idea at 25 but I don't think it goes here. Maybe that comes later, or is even a nice coda/ending to the whole piece.

In fact, maybe it belongs at 49.

I'm not at all sold on this "countermelody" idea you have in the high part.

Again, it just is now starting to seem like, "I need to make my piece longer, but this is all the melody I have to work with, so how can I set it in yet another way".

So it's starting to come off as this "self competition" where you've just challenged yourself to come up with as many ways to set the same melody as you can.

Which makes it sound more like an exercise than a coherent piece.

57, eh, it's kind of a cool idea, but you know, I don't know. And 65, oh geez, now you've really gone overboard. 

What it starts sounding like back at 49 is "I need a new variation, but I've run out of ideas, let me try something even more drastic" and by the time you get to 65 it's gotten so far from the mood of the first 3 sections that it's really just a bombastic mess (no offense).

Have you ever seen a movie that starts off really good but something happens midway through and it just is weak from there to the end? It's like their budget got slashed half way through and they just had to edit together whatever B roll they had left and finish the film sometimes.

That's kind of what is happening (or sounds to a listener is happening) here. It sounds like you ran out of ideas and just tried to make ones that don't belong, fit.

Now, I'm not saying the ideas are bad, but it's also like trying to cram every type of shot into a movie that didn't belong. Even though Hitchcock loved all of his interesting shots, not every film has every possible kind of low angle shot in or something (or not even one movie).

My first gut instinct about 65 was simply "take it out".

But you know what, this is like maybe, the Directors Cut, and I'm Sony saying, "nope, you need to edit this down to a run time of 1.5 hours from your 4 hour thing".

But it's not like a great directors cut - it's more like it's got a lot of stuff that needs to be edited out and needs some dissolves, wipes, and cross fades or something - the edit points need work and there's too many different scenes of the same actor in settings that just get stranger and stranger!

That could work for an experimental film or piece of music, but that's not what it seems like you're going for here at all.

I think you're just trying to cram too many things in here.

The first 3 ideas are nice, and the thing at 25 is a nice contrast but doesn't belong there.

I would take these other ideas - the counter melody bit, the LH melody idea, the bombastic idea, and just use them in different pieces.

It's kind of like filming on location, and seeing this awesome rainbow across the desert, and saying "lets get a shot of that for an establishing shot" or something, then putting it in the movie just because you shot it, liked it, and wanted to use it, even though it really didn't fit - that's why you have all these other people who go, "does it really need to be there? Maybe we can save that for another special - on the making of, or another movie" - That's kind of what B Roll is isn't it?

So you're using all your B Roll stuff in here  - it's Expedition Unknown right now - they've gong to like 3 hour episodes that are all B Roll stuff and clips from other episodes. But they cut all that B Roll stuff out of the original hour long episodes because it was really superfluous.

I think that's exactly what you need to do here.

Pick 3, or 4, or at most 5 (the 5th being an intro and/or outro, or contrast section, etc.) settings and use those for the piece.

Don't be afraid to repeat things (the A section idea is the only one that does). I realize the melody is somewhat repetitive but maybe try varying the melody rather than the accompaniment and setting.

For example, you could have your "waltz" pattern again later, but with an embellished version of the melody this time (but not a counter melody added) - so instead of constantly varying the accomp and setting, you'd repeat that with a variation of the melody.

john goes to the park on monday, and john goes to the par on tuesday. The park doesn't change, but john's clothes can. Your main melody is dressed differently - "embellished" if you will, but the setting is the same. Right now you're just putting John into 10 different scenes with not continuity other than John. Probably not what you want for this kind of piece.

I hope that all helps.

As always, YMMV and I'm just some dude on the internet, so feel free to ignore the advice if you want.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-04-13 22:02:45 freshhellisweak<br>I suggest learning how to build chords next and inversions and intervals.  I also, dove into music theory on my own.  

Now that you know your major and minor scales you can start learning how to construct chords based on the scale degrees and their inversions. 

You can also learn about chord progressions which are based on scale degrees.

Then you can get into smooth voice leading, melody and harmony point and counter point.

Then maybe check out the circle of fifths.

The list goes on.

The way I decided what to learn next is I applied the need to my playing.

For example, I write songs so these are some of things I emphasized early on so I could learn my way around a keyboard/guitar fret board.

One big piece of advice I can give you is try to learn to hear and think about music in terms of melody, harmony and intervals not specific notes or key signatures.  Try to get into the mindset of analyzing music based on scale degrees, not necessarily the key something is played in.  

While yes, it’s important to acknowledge the key of a piece of music to help give you reference and comprehension, being able to identify intervals and chords voicings, regardless of what key they are in, is a huge step and powerful tool to training your ear and knowing how to translate knowing what you want to hear to playing what you want to hear.

Hope this helps!!
