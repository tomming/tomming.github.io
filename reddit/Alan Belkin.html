Maybe one of you could please help me identify what they are and help me find a solution to get rid of them.

Also, very few jobs should have drug testing. Unless you're operating heavy machinery or require absolute sobriety, like a surgeon, I don't think drug testing is appropriate. That should be something the law enforces (if at all) and not your place of employment. This will become an especially important issue after marijuana legalisation, which I think is inevitable and should happen sooner than later.

I think what would be more helpful to beginners is a shorter list or wiki page or something, which only contains a few packs that hit broad categories - e.g. good beginner pack, intro-level skyblock pack, vanilla+ pack, and so on. Not an exhaustive list or even the "best" packs (a never-ending debate), but sort of a baseline for people to introduce themselves to modded Minecraft.

Well that depends on the definition of discriminate.

Google defines it as:

&gt;make an unjust or prejudicial distinction in the treatment of different categories of people or things, especially on the grounds of race, sex, or age.

now to define unjust:

&gt;not based on or behaving according to what is morally right and fair.

And prejudicial: 

&gt;harmful to someone or something; detrimental.

So here we see a very major problem with this. Racism is only racism if it is discriminatory by making immoral and harmful distinctions between racial groups. If Racism is defined this way—Racism already has a major problem. It is based off of morals, which differ from person to person, and is also based off of perceived detrimental impact. Now there is already a major problem with this: scientific facts can be racist if they hurt somebody's feelings or result in hardship in a group. In fact every distinction between races is racist because it will cause hardship to somebody. Now I would get into the **scientific facts** but since this is /r/musictheory, and I have responded to everything, I don't think much more is needed to prove my point.

There was no feeling quite like starting a new MMO with a childlike sense of wonder, knowing absolutely nothing. CrossCode both simulates and even makes fun of MMO's which I find quite unique and enjoyable.

Also, the puzzles are fantastic. I generally stay away from puzzle games, but the puzzles in CrossCode are just the right difficulty - I've never had to look up an answer, but I always feel rewarded when solving them, and no two puzzle rooms are the same. And damn, they're epic and long too - the dungeon design is just crazy good honestly.

</p></li><li><p><b>Philippines</b><br>Yes

Like, come on dude, you're hiding what happened under the abstraction of "the actions". That obviously matters.
</p></li><li><p><b>Philippines</b><br>There's a tendency within the progressive wing of the Democrats to try and stretch the definition of "socialism" to make the case for Norway and the Scandinavian countries to be socialism, in order to show that socialism can work, while also distancing themselves from places like Cuba and Venezuela.

Because if you say "yes, Venezuela is socialist", then you have to make the case that Venezuela is not a failed state. Or if you say "yes, Cuba is socialist", then you have to make the case that Cuba isn't a poor country, and that Cuba isn't an authoritarian country. Or if you say "yes, the USSR was socialist", then you have to defend the USSR's collapse, you're going to get dragged into being a Stalin apologist, and so on and so forth.

_(the other side of this coin, of course, is that the conservatives don't care and they're going to call you a Maduro-loving Communist anyway, which makes "moderate socialism" kind of a dead-end in terms of pushing for a political program - if trying to pass government-subsidized health insurance gets as much resistance as establishing a fully nationalized universal healthcare service, you might as well go for the gold)_

By shifting the discussion towards Norway, you don't get into these allegations about genocide, or gulags, or invasions of Afghanistan, or political repression and so forth. You **do** have to make the case that socialism is "just" about **"the government does stuff for the public good"**, and while actual Marxists are going to take issue with such a blatant oversimplification, most Americans aren't yet at a level of class consciousness that it would matter to them anyway.

Having said all that, _"the government does stuff for the public good"_ is **really** not socialism. That's _Social Democracy_ at best.

</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>It's pretty good. Silent pianos have been around for a long time. I've personally seen one that Liszt used at his house in Budapest. Apparently Rachmaninoff used one to practise his third concerto on the ship ride across the Atlantic to the USA.

Here is a nice discussion on the Virgil Practice Clavier and some discussion on silent practising: https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=2368.0

Personally, I feel silent practising can help with the choreography/technique of a troublesome section. It enhances the sensation of proprioception and touch in a similar way to how you can hear more clearly if you close your eyes. Ideally one should close their eyes and practise silently to enhance proprioception and touch even more but then it would be quite difficult to know if mistakes are being made. Silent practising can also enhance your ear and aural imagination, particularly if you know what kind of shape, mood, feel, timbre, etc. you want but for whatever reason can't quite recreate it on the piano. Reasons such as the limitations of your technique, limitations of your particular piano...actually limitations in technique is multi-faceted. For instance, if you are hurrying, struggling or straining with a particular section, it stands to reason that you are also unable to hear it properly because you are too occupied with the technical and physical demands. Using aural imagination without movement in some cases can improve the technical side. Then if you can imagine it physically being easy and hear it in your imagination then improvement can also result. You might be limited in speed physically, but with imagination there is no such physical limitation. And if you can't imagine it quickly, then something is awry. It helps in these cases to watch a good pianist play it on video and do various imagination explorations to see if you can increase the speed/ease in your imagination when you imagine yourself playing it. Anyway, I've started to go on an unusual tangent here so I'll stop.

Listen to The Chairman Dances of Adams or Phrygian Gates. For something that has a long melody like the Chopin piece, I recommend Ravel's Second Piano Concerto, 2nd movement. Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata also has a beautiful melody like that. Try listening to some Debussy if you like Satie, maybe La Cathedrale Engloutie. Also, if you wnat something like Penderecki but even crazier, you can listen to Black Angels by George Crumb but PROCEED WITH CAUTION! I hope you have fun listening.

As an alternative to root canals, ask your dentist about titanium implants. I had a root canal fail after 3 years. Even though it failed I don't regret the decision to do the root canal because my work dental insurance paid for the procedure (including crown), while implants are typically not covered by most insurance (considered "cosmetic"). However implants have the reputation of being built "for life", root canals not so much. Dentists have it drilled into them to "save the tooth", but if the failure rate rate is too high and you then have to resort to the extra time and considerable expense to get an implant, what's the point? It's worth at least discussing with your dentist (seriously, ask about the failure rate and when it makes clear sense to choose one option over the other). FYI, I was initially quoted nearly $4000 for the whole process - the main procedures are the extraction (cheap), implant (very expensive), crown (somewhat expensive). Was told insurance would only cover the extraction but in the end the crown was covered as well. I negotiated down to $3500 - the short story is by agreeing to pay cash upfront (and later received about an $800 refund when insurance decided to cover the crown which was the final procedure).
</p></li><li><p><b>AskReddit</b><br>Nixon was nominated Fed Chairman by Jimmy Carter and started the position in August 1979, months before the election was decided or Reagan took office. Interest rates were jacked up because inflation was out of control, not because of unions. But since Volcker conspired with Nixon to "suspend" the gold standard in 1971, he helped pave the way for the inflation he eventually had to suppress. Interest rates were slashed as inflation was toned down.

If you want a real look at Reagan's flaws, [Ronald Reagan - An Autopsy](https://www.epjresearchroom.com/2016/11/ronald-reagan-autopsy.html) is a good start, or Reagan's [record of trade protectionism](https://mises.org/library/ronald-reagan-protectionist) such as curbing imports of Japanese cars and adding a 45% tariff on Japanese motorcycles to keep Harley Davidson happy.

We had different options available. But, for technical reasons, we end up simply having someone offstage dictating the motion of the ball with a computer. Since we couldn't have a crowd of 2000 people to test the game beforehand, having someone to "manually track the ball" gave us some flexibility in case the games ends up being too hard or too easy. 

We also made a "demo version" of the games (with interactive audio mockup) so that we can practice it with the conductor alone before rehearsing it with the orchestra. Rehearsal with orchestra was pretty simple. We had someone controlling the ball on the computer and the conductor was simply following on the screen. Also the music is very easy to perform: short looping music with little jingles. So it's quite straight and forward to put together.

It has been performed only once so far (Sept 29th, 2017). But an other orchestra has already approached me to perform it in a "youth audience" concert. I'm looking for more opportunity to get it perform. I think it could be a good way to engage new audience in orchestra concerts.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I also just started this book! I’ve found myself best understanding things when i read a chapter then re read that chapter at the piano. This book really is coming from a composing stand point but you can also use those ideas in your playing but you really have to practice them to get to that point of meditative playing. You wont have time to think of these ideas quickly so taking time on your primary instrument to play through these harmonic ideas would be super helpful with your comprehension if then.

my comment from that thread

&gt; Eat simple and eat clean, organic/raw/grassfed no hormones no soy etc all that good shit. (My big 3: meat, potatoes, spinach). I don't fuck around with a variety of vegetables. Potatoes really are my only source of carbs. No rice no bread no beans. Keep it simple. Dairy isnt necessary although it isn't really harmful either, it's especially cool for younger boys still growing (but again, buy this only if you can afford the clean and raw shit). Cook with animal fats (ghee butter, duck fat etc). Eat liver. (The greatest superfood) Simply use bell pepper and Himalayan salt to season your food. (Most spices and herbs have an anti-androgenic effect). Snack on fruits and celery (pomegranate, watermelon, pineapple, berries, citrus fruits). Drink filtered water (I own a berkey). Get quality sleep. lift heavy, quick and intense 3/4 days a week.

&gt; High fat diet (40-50%). Raise your carbs on big lift days, lower them on rest days. Understand how much protein you really need. It's slightly different for everybody. Generally, people always seem to go overboard with protein when eating "big" and leave too little room for good fats and productive carbs.

&gt; Try to really do intermittent fasting and carb Backloading. This way your carbs work efficiently. Feast between 4-5 hours, Fast for 20-19 hours.

&gt; Ideally what you should try to do is lift big around 4 or 5pm, eat all your food before 10-11pm and get to sleep. This way your putting your body in sync with a more anabolic and androgenic rhythm. You are hacking your body for optimal growth, recovery, and performance.

&gt; Other than that, practice healthy competition, hang out with your boys. Build your tribe and push each other. A healthy sex life will also keep your mind right, so keep a girl on hand.

&gt; I also recommend these supplements.

&gt; Boron. Zinc and magnesium (don't go overboard with zinc, just get it to a healthy level). Vitamin D liquid. Blue Ice Butter oil/Fermented Cod liver oil Blend. Creatine Monohydrate.

&gt; Quit using plastic. Use glass, wood, steel etc. Use quality cookware. Cast iron pans and whatever else work. Buy safe grooming and cleaning products.

&gt; Don't lose your mind over it, just be aware of the nasty crap you could be putting in and on your body.

That was cool hearing. I'm a young dude also interested in Alt/Traditional/Organic health habits (with an emphasis on testosterone optimization)... Drinking my filtered water out of glass bottles and all that.

I don't consume chlorella tablets any longer because If I remember correctly I believe it's actually "estrogenic" like flax seed.

If you're a dude, make sure your healthy diet is *good to your male hormones*. 

My girl eats the flax seed, I'll eat the chia seeds.

She was sunk intentionally by the island's owner Charles Hanson in 1930.The masts can still be seen laying in the water at the bow of the Rewa. When the Rewa was sunk the top deck was cut off her as the tide came in which is why she is cut on an angle.

For example, to cause voltage problems, connect that wire to receptacles using the back stab method.  If that wire does not fully wrap around a then tightened screw, then a workmanship problem exists creating problems for electric motors.

Another major mistake.  Wires must be fully twisted together before its wire nut is installed.  Otherwise motors can suffer a harmful voltage drop when powered on.

Lights never dim if wires are properly sized AND (this is where bad workmanship exists) properly connected.

A relationship between brownouts and surges only exists in myths and advertising.  Power restoration never creates a surge - despite myths that claim otherwise.

No utility power?  It is entirely from generators?  Inferior generators do not respond well to changing loads.  That might explain failures.  But again, first failed internal part(s) must be known.  Also how great that voltage variation (a number) is necessary to say more.

Surges (microsecond events) would not exist on systems powered only from a local generator.  However, minor voltage variations from that generator can quickly destroy plug-in protectors (and its light cannot report that type of failure).
</p></li><li><p><b>sysadmin</b><br>'Whole house' protection costs about $1 per appliance.  It must be at least 50,000 amps.  That defines its life expectancy.  Its effectiveness during each anomaly is defined by a low impedance (ie less than 10 foot) connection to and the quality of single point earth ground.  That earth ground needs most attention.

If many grounds exist, then damage has been made easier.  Much money spent to make things worse.  For this one anomaly, single point ground is essential.

Voltage variations from 105 to 130 is not harmful to electronics.  It is potentially harmful to motorized devices (ie central air, refrigerator).  But all electronics are designed to work just fine even when incandescent bulbs dim to 50% intensity.  The incandescent bulb is a best diagnostic tool.

Obviously a UPS will kick in repeatedly.  But that should not harm UPS electronics; only problematic for its battery.  But then a UPS battery is typically good only for three years (not to be confused with something completely different called a UPS whose batteries should last something less than 20 years).

Voltages vary at a transformer that serves his street and most others in the large neighborhood.  When loads are expected to increase, that transformer increases voltage to all homes.  Then the voltage in all homes remains close to 120 volts.  Maybe his power is connected too close to that distant transformer.  So he may suffer major voltage shifts.  But those are not harmful to electronics.

Other anomalies can also exist that electricians would not know about / understand.

Power conditioning is a vague expression used to even sell scams.  Some power conditioners are nothing more than a knot tied in a wire.  Serious power conditioner only for another anomaly called noise is a series mode filter.  These must weight tens of pounds when used on 120 volt receptacle connections.  And do little to nothing for other anomalies.

Power conditioner that is not defined by specific specifications is better considered a myth or bogus.  Long before even considering a power conditioner, first that one anomaly must be defined.  Since electronic power supplies make many of those anomalies irrelevant.

Best 'whole house' protector typically costs tens of times less than plug-in protectors.  And must exist if using plug-in protectors.

If power is so unreliable, then many residential homes already have backup generators (ie Genrac).  So why can his facility not have one?

But yes, it does appear using someone else's datacenter (the cloud) is a better alternative.  Since they must already have battery backed up generators.  And have people who know the many completely different anomalies.  Have then implemented the unique solution for each anomaly.  No one magic solution exists for all anomalies.  But most are already made irrelevant by what must exist inside each computer.

'Whole house' protector is quite inexpensive.  And not only must be in every datacenter.  It is even recommended / necessary for every home.  Because it is so effective and so inexpensive - for an anomaly that typically happens maybe once every seven years.  And in some venues, may not happen for 20 years.
</p></li><li><p><b>AskEngineers</b><br>u/kelchm stated exactly what must be done long before making accusations or seeking a solution.  A problem / failure must be defined long before implementing any solution.  He said:
&gt; The first step is to make sure you fully understand the failure mode so you can actually solve for the right issue. 

Best evidence is always in a dead body.  Disassemble a tool to either fix it.  To learn from mistakes so that another tool can be fixed.  But most important, to determine what exactly failed.

Surges are not brownouts.  Anyone who does not know that is best ignored.  Surges are 120 volts approaching 1000 volts.  Surges are quite rare - maybe once every seven years.  Surges are often blamed by people who have no electrical knowledge - due to an education only from advertising.

Brownouts are completely different - 120 volts dropping towards zero.  Brownouts cause no damage to electronics.  But can be harmful to motorized appliances.

What is your voltage?  That means you have a three digit meter.  Or an even more useful (educational) tool is a Kill-A-Watt.

Those motorized appliances are typically designed for 120 volt service.  If yours is 110 volts or less, then that can explain internal wiring failure.  But again, this suspect (like most other posts) is only based in speculation.  What exactly is damaged?  Armature? Brushes? Bearings?  Identify that failure long before making accusations.

Low voltage is one potential reason for failure.  Another is voltage variation.  Simply power an incandescent bulb from same receptacles that powers tools.  Do those bulbs change intensity?  They should not.  A dimming bulb (voltage drop) is especially stressful to electric motors during power on.  Dimming bulbs indicate poor workmanship in wiring.

Especially bad is a bulb that increases intensity when some other tool powers.  That again is often poor workmanship.  But a more serious concern since it can also be reporting a human safety threat.

Best evidence is in a dead body.  Described are other tests that can identify faults - long before blaming or fixing anything.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you drift, you have to adjust your intonation or embrace the pitch shifting.

The only real solution is to play wolf intervals - my grandmother watches some cheesy Turkish soap operas and I have heard things like wolf fifths in their soundtrack, so such cultures doesn't care about perfect JI all the time (they also use stuff like flat major thirds). I think Harry Partch also was advocating using all the intervals, not drifting up or down.

Another solution - using creative use of pitch bending - think of Indian vocal music or blues to mask unmusicality of hearing the same interval, modulating a small comma up or down.

Or perform in just tuning, but following the steps of certain edo. I think there are other techniques for adaptive tuning like having different meantone chains, separated by a small interval - people on microtonal forum here or on Facebook may know more about this.

Find the number written on your lighting and cooling, it's usually written in the panel board that allows your to override lights. Make a request to keep the AC on continuously due to in-store contracting work. If they ask for an exact temperature let them know a temperature that's cool enough and explain again it's due to work being done in the store that it requires the AC to be overridden manually. Depending on how it goes from this point on, you'll honestly have to wing it. 

Likewise if you see the contractor for a work order let him know if he can disable the timers for the hvacs. This will let it run continuously if they know how to turn off the remote monitor. 


This will work only for a few portions of stores and is literally the best idea I have for some locations as it's feasible and by passes Help Desk with the temperature controls they've set on their end. Most Officemax locations may have better luck with it than Depot locations however due to how the temperature receivers on the HVAC are a bit different.
</p></li><li><p><b>OfficeDepot</b><br>With the way it was changes for returns with the updated place mats in the WUWD a few weeks back, you're basically stuck selling them. It might've been possible when they first came in to do the return by processing a return request via Gmil or customer service but it's too late for that. Those used to be sold in stores ironically enough.
</p></li><li><p><b>OfficeDepot</b><br>It was honestly expected. It's not a good sign for the company to hit the liquidation market with stores during BTS. Doing it after and for q4 means (1) they can pay themselves on the back for lowering costs and increasing revenue, (2) the higher earnings via lower costs allows then to ignore that Compucon was either a bad purchase or at least was overpaid for it, (3) I believe the next set of cuts were targeting those in the b2b sections but it's not like we're making leads in stores and the company refuses to acknowledge that if the stores look like shit no one is going to feel comfortable trusting us with their business.

Your delivery for this line honestly ended me, it was just too adorable just like the rest of this audio, tbh. Thanks for posting and giving me the fantasy of running off with my guy friends on their wedding day!

But really, this audio is yummy, bless!

But honestly, this whole thing smacks of Logic^TM and an overly computerized approach to a puzzle by people who worship machines don't really study music. Like 65TwinReverbRI said, we've already got data (both quality and quantity) that proves their argument true. Are they really adding anything?

Also of note, their analytic paradigm wasn't sophisticated enough to properly give a summation of Beethoven's style so I find myself asking "Why did you all even do this to begin with?"

Don't even know why I'm adding this comment because I'm not saying anything you and others haven't already said. I just find the cultural trend of *needing data* (and of course data being something reducible to numbers) worrying and horrfying. Or in this case, just plain stupid.

1.) Okay, I *would* use them if I actually composed anymore. Whatever, meanie.

For a good intermediate chord progression/bass line the verse of Lost in the Harbour from Alice is a fun challenge. I think he uses a pump organ on the recording. 
</p></li><li><p><b>Accordion</b><br>Hi all,

I finished this album a few days ago. It’s in the style of neo-folk, which is usually acoustic guitar driven, and connected to historical or pagan religious themes. I became sort of obsessed with this idea of a fictional Barbarian tribe outside of the Roman Empire, and the next time I practiced I found these simple melodies that kept sneaking in between scales, and decided to record them later. Then I added some voice, recorder, tambourine, and throat singing to round out the sound. 

There’s a bit of a story on the Bandcamp page that I wrote that goes into a little more detail, but I hope fans of trad folk on accordion may enjoy this.

Did they just mean "does our website use HTML5 elements"? Because that seems like a pretty innocuous question.
</p></li><li><p><b>webdev</b><br>I mean...strictly from a technical sense I think it could be an issue if you open the excel file in a program that's not excel, such that the formatting is no longer what was originally intended.

But non-technically, it's like if an author handed in their draft of a novel written entirely on cocktail napkins. No, it doesn't \~technically\~ break any rules but it's so weird and out of touch that it raises red flags as to how they handle other things.
</p></li><li><p><b>webdev</b><br>I was actually going to suggest changing the form to having them rank their needs in order since they couldn't make EVERYTHING URGENT that way, but this actually makes so much more sense as a way to screen out bad clients too.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I think it would be more a question of staggering breaths between the voices. I definitely want the sections to be rubato, so I think if I make sure no two instruments breathe at the same time I can keep a nice sustain throughout without any holes. So when one instrument breathes, another is still holding a note and vice versa. It would be an interesting exercise for sure.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Thank you! Yes, you're so right, those phrases are too long for a single breath.  I think staggering breaths is a great idea, especially since the texture is so exposed and breathing sounds would be rather loud.

&amp;#x200B;

There are more pieces waiting to be added to this set, I'd love to do as many as possible. I have already two more started, plus ideas for a few more. And yes, the first one is also my favorite! What a hauntingly beautiful melody.

That diet is completely devoid of vitamins (except for the B's) We need other vitamins for good health. We also need certain acids that you likely are not getting.

Meat are high in saturated fat, and also the cause of cholesterol. There's a reason why we teach kids about a balanced diet at age 6 onwards (I think)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Ooh did I say that

Yes I think that was you! Have a good day
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I have a favourite key for different instruments for reasons of range. There is no different experience [nowadays] between keys. 

I encourage you to venture out of the keys you are familiar with though. You want to know the chords and notes off the top of your head for every key at some stage. 

As another commenter said the other day on a similar question 'we don't tolerate keyism these days'

Honk if you love G#. All the best.

I read Mythago Wood and Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn (which is my favorite book of the series) around the same age as you, and I've reread them many times since. This year I read Lavondyss for the first time. Didn't like it as much as the others, but the towards the end it got really weird and trippy, which was great. 

I also read the first two books of Merlin Codex, but the third was never translated, and I only now got the original trilogy so I still got that one to finish.

Sweden and Finland have been on their way up for 10,000 years. During the last Ice Age, massive glaciers formed all over Scandinavia, and they were so heavy that their weight warped the surface of the earth, pushing it down into the viscous mantle. When the ice melted, "post-glacial rebound" began, and Scandinavia is still rising at a rate of about 9 millimeters a year, three times faster than the Baltic Sea is rising.
