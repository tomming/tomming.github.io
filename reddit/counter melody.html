</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2009-06-12 15:22:22 powarblasta5000<br>I think it is referring to the concept of using bass to provide a counterpoint or counter-melody. Also, it is very interesting to watch a whole show about bass.
</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2009-06-13 00:38:17 HUAONE<br>i see your point, but <b><u>counter melody</u></b> can be created using any range of notes, not just bass. it's just that the most practical point of bass is to create counter melodies, since bass instruments in general aren't bright enough to make melodies coherent. 
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2009-06-15 08:28:39 huerequeque<br>First of all, I think this is good stuff.  I particularly like the rhythm section groove, which kind of reminds me of some of Donald Harrison's music.  I have a couple of suggestions that I hope will help you keep developing this piece, since I think it has lots of potential.

I think you could differentiate the head from the solo by tightening up the melody a little.  Right now it sounds a little bit meandering and unfocused.  There are lots of ways you can give the melody more integrity and a sense of logical development.  

First, try putting some space into it.  Right now it kind of sounds like one long phrase.  Putting a few rests in here and there would split it up into shorter phrases and make the melody more memorable.  Try to work with these smaller phrases so there's some sense of development from one to the next, either in terms of the rhythms, pitches, or length of the phrase.  Or you might prefer to make the individual phrases contrast with each other and seem discontinuous.  Either way, spacing the melody out into discrete phrases will allow you to establish a sense of continuity/contrast, which makes the whole thing more memorable and more musical.

I'd also recommend that you try repeating the melody and changing some things up the second time.  Perhaps you could add a counter-melody or harmony part.  Or maybe even just let the rhythm section loosen up a little rather than playing the strict pattern.

Also, I agree with you on the walking bass.  Anyway, nice work, and thanks for sharing it with us.  Keep it up, and post again if you make any revisions or record it with live musicians.

*tl;dr: good stuff; split the melody up into shorter phrases; repeat the head; let the rhythm section loosen up a bit; thanks for sharing.*

Jazz is usually played by a small combo: three or four members. Chamber music, a popular and breathtaking genre of classical music is also played by a small combo: quartets and quintets usually. Aside from the instrumentation (which is obviously vastly different), there are several things I can think of that separate the music theoretically. 

Classical has less focus on repetitious chord changes. For instance, if you take a neo-jazz tune like "Cantalope Island" by Herbie Hancock, I think the chordal pattern focuses on the I, the VI and the V (and subsitutions thereof) of whatever key the bandleader decides to play it in. There is usually a head repeated throughout the music with several sections of improv. Were this piece of music hypothetically written by a classicist sitting at a piano bench in the 1600s, it may have the same head, but the composer would more than likely dispense with the I-VI-V and write far more complex variations to give the head room to move around in different textures. This changing of the chordal textures would necessitate small changes to the head (without changing the overall theme... that would involve both melody and metric changes), and there would be very little repetition (not taking into account something like a coda). The music would build over movements rather than the verse-chorus type methodology.

Classical music also, for all intents and purposes, has zero focus on improv. Jazz, on the other hand, basically takes improv and makes it the center piece of the music. Heads are merely passages designed to separate solos and keep a piece thematically similar in much of modern combo jazz. 

Jazz also has far less focus on counter-melody in my experience. In any given classical piece, you'll hear one, two, three, four, ten instruments playing distinct variations on the head with different metrics and harmonic intervals to build the entire experience. Usually, modern jazz eschews this idea and goes for a one or two instrument approach while the others in the combo hold the groove. 

The theory is the same: a Bminor7 will be a Bminor7 in any theater. The differences are more in approach, instrumentation and intention. =)

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2010-05-04 07:20:09 thehellezell<br>I have the same problem at times.  For example, I'll commonly come up with a great "bridge" but not have a "refrain" for it to lead to.  I try to write for at least two hours a day, and will generally get something good out of that, but often times it sort of sits in a slush pile for about a year until I come up with the missing pieces it needs.  After I figured this out, I spend at least one day a week now going over piles and piles of old shit and try to see if anything fits well together.  This is one way to work.  You should feel lucky we have computers now!  It's so much easier to transpose stuff (if part A was written in Ab and part B and C were in D, you can just adjust one or another).  

As far as a guitar goes, since it's not the most immediately expressive instrument, it can be difficult to generate interesting, spontaneous melodies.  To get around this, I keep a recorder with me and just start humming shit.  You'd be surprised what you can come up with just using your voice.  

Collaboration with someone of a like-mind can be very very great, because it will give you experience with arrangement and synthesis.  It also is great to have someone to tell you "that's great" or "that's shit."  You can work a lot faster, and you're repetition bias is lessened. 

Finally, one thing that works if you're in a rut is to look at similar works (within your genre, or in the same scale, or however you want to do it) and learn them / deconstruct them to figure out WHY they're good (or not).  Mel-Bay song books can be really useful for this.  

As far as drugs... it depends on what you're going for.  I personally think your best friends are coffee and general sobriety.  Amphetamines are not useful (for me, anyway) in terms of coming up with larger ideas, but they can help keep you focused when you're hammering out a composition (so, you've got the basic melody or chord patten, but you've still got to write the bass line, write the piano part, figure out how in the hell to end the thing, construct a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, record a demo for the rest of the band, etc.).  In terms of this, think of this sort of like writing a paper (which is what most teenies take amphetamines for).  Your paper will suck ass if you take a bunch of Adderall and don't know what you're even supposed to be writing about, or what your position is.  It will probably be pretty good if you've already got an outline written out, know what you're going to argue, and THEN take the shit (my experience grading hundreds of freshman-level essays is where I'm getting this).  

But you don't need any drugs whatsoever (although Richard Hell and Megadeth are two immediate examples of bands that got terrible after they sobered up).  You DO need to come up with a regularly scheduled time to work as much as possible in order to take advantage of inspiration when it strikes! 

Stick with it and good luck!

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2010-10-04 12:16:18 d0zad0za<br>This is a really cool way to see it. 

I agree with OP, objectivity seems to be one of the hardest things for me to achieve as well, even when i'm getting positive reinforcement from a friend and my head starts to grow. 

A month is a long time, and that would be really good to clear the mind, but I find that even ignoring the song and sleeping on it is sometimes enough for me to be able to listen 'refreshed' and ready to either add things, or take away from it. 

The idea of listening with a friend present in front of you is really cool and I will definitely be trying this out. I really don't like to share my roughs with just anyone because I know they are just roughs and things are still missing and the demo is still raw, but when I do show them I look at their reactions and take the slightest sensitivity to the music into consideration whether its good or bad. 

I'll finish with this, the way I prepare myself to listen to my track is by having a mic set to record and usually listening through headphones or just my monitors while I sing, speak, or do whatever in real time with the music. This allows me to extract thought instantly and better 'direct' and shape my music. If i have an idea, i'm speaking it into the mic in regards to what should happen, I'f i'm feeling a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, or something melodic, I will sing it/beatbox it and then play it on an instrument. 




</p></li><li><p><b>Learnmusic</b> 2010-10-29 04:41:54 mungthewicked<br>Best advice: Keep writing and absorb as much from others.  Don't steal!  Play what you like, but being receptive to new ideas and suggestions/criticism can bring your writing to new heights.

In terms of music that can teach you about writing, I'd suggest The Beatles 1964-1970 (especially Sgt. Peppers - Abbey Road).  Everything before Hard Days Night isn't the most impressive, but that depends if you want to make some extra poppy songs.  People may laugh considering today's standards and technologies, but their music will teach you arrangement, harmony, layering of vocals and instrumentation, and melody.  If you understand their music, you can branch out to many other styles.  If you consider yourself a guitar buff as well, you'd be surprised how much their lead and finger picking can teach you.  That foundation can be applied to more complicated stuff like Page, Hendrix, Randy Rhodes, Clapton, John McGlaughlin, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, etc. - guys who wrote songs but played with melody, soul, and feeling while still being able to tear it up.

As far as lyrics, I'd suggest Jim Morrison, Don Henley, Maynard James Keenan off the top of my head.  Why?  If you're looking for poetry, Morrison can teach you a lot.  Don Henley is an excellent story teller.  I don't particularly like the Eagles or his solo career, but the man could write some good lyrics that flow.  Maynard falls somewhere between those two.  Tom Waits and Les Claypool also just popped in my head.  They're good story tellers, but you need to be careful.  I've seen people, influenced by them, write some really crappy and corny lyrics.

Make your singing melodies memorable.  A classic example is Scott Weiland or The Beatles.  I know I can't stand when it just seems like some R-tard with a mic is singing a bunch of words but never took time to really construct a good melody.  Also, don't try to cram too many words into lines.  There are exceptions of course (System of a Down), Pauses, cadence, and rhythm go hand-in-hand with melody.  Also, be mindful of the actual words you use.  Some vowels and consonants flow better for each individual for certain accents, cadences, and pitch.

Listen to different genres.  Pick up other instruments.  Play something in a different key.  If you play guitar, try alternate tunings (like Nashville tuning, half or whole step down, Key of F, or slide tunings) or de-tunings (Drop-A, Drop-B, Drop-C, Drop-D).

Take ideas from classical composers who mastered arrangement, instrumentation, and counter melodies.  If a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is good enough, it could supplant the melody you were originally using.

Also, try writing songs with your contemporaries or find some mentors.

Music theory.  Yes, it can be fun or boring depending how you feel about it.  Sometimes, it can help you find that one chord that helps finish a progression, transition, or starting point for a new section of a song.

I'll leave it at that.  I could write a novel on this.  I hope that helps.

</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2010-11-13 09:01:03 disaster_face<br>Where are you having trouble exactly?

  I would say just start simple...  write a short chord progression.  Then write a melody over it.  Then try adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  Then try varying the backing part so it isn't just straight chords.  As you get more comfortable composing, more and more complex ideas will evolve.

Counterpoint is good to study, since you'll have no choice but to compose when you do the exercises.  

Once you feel comfortable with all that, then start learning about orchestration.  

As far as books go, i can give you plenty of recommendations on theory texts, but you can't really learn how to compose from a book.  You've got to just do it.  

Learning to improvise on your instrument is also a good skill to have.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2010-11-26 02:04:52 spasmdaze<br>i do agree with you that there is something missing...might adjust the bassline to do an actual phrase instead of just lfo'y rhythms, might add another supporting <b><u>counter melody</u></b>...who knows!

</p></li><li><p><b>unheardof</b> 2011-01-26 11:15:49 borntorunathon<br>It sounds like you need to find some musician friends and play in a band. You're experimenting with harmony and melody well, but nothing can replace the sound of a real, well made instrument. Synthesizers can be good if they are well made, but layers and layers of fake instruments from a cheap yamaha type keyboard or cheap program is very off-putting for the ear no matter how good the composition is. Other than that, the composition is a little dated (I'm thinking '82 fusion), and too dense, but you're doing interesting things with melody (in the cello synth) and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> (in the sax? section). The piano solos on the other hand are very repetitive both melodically and rhythmically. All in all, you have an ear for music, so try recording a song of yours with a band. Even if its a very lo-fi recording, it will sound much better than this.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2011-01-29 02:23:45 brainiac256<br>Generally speaking, if you want to do this, use melodic variation to maintain interest from your audience. Bonus points for overlaying it as a counter-melody later on.

I'd stray away from using that same impact "pewwww" more than once. It's a really recognizable sound so it sounds a bit lazy when you use it so many times.

Drop at 4:07 is cool, I dig it. I like that hi hat and clap pattern. Has a nice, crisp sound to it.

You should have a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something come in, I reckon. There's lots of little synth action going on in the background which is pretty cool, but the main bassline is a tad repetitive. Still nice, though.

Cool track.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2011-02-05 14:55:00 kuchini<br>just write, one note at a time, writing music is one of those things where you gotta figure it out for yourself first before you truly get it. It will suck at first, what comes from your head will most likely not sound at all to what you imagined until you grind out track after track. But don't give up when you become discouraged, take a break, analysis new music for a few days and try figuring out new things they do you never thought of and read, but do your best to avoid burning out.

The hardest part sometimes is when you look at your screen or instrument and feel lost, no inspiration, nothing, but just play and record it, who cares if it's absolutely horrid. Add more things to it, play around with it, add new sounds, try new keys, different chord progressions, another melody, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, harmony, rhythm, bass... It''ll eventually become like a puzzle when you can reach that point and its pretty fun making it all fit together, you don't worry about making music you just write what you feel should come next. It's like the music you wrote took on a life of itself sometimes.

</p></li><li><p><b>AskReddit</b> 2011-02-19 11:45:53 rogersmith25<br>It may not be what you're looking for, but the song "Time" from the Inception soundtrack is particularly moving when taken away from the film itself.

It's very uncommon to find a piece of music that can stir up this much emotion. It build's to an incredible peak very slowly and gradually, adding layer after layer -- so gradually it can sneak up on you.

It begins with a simple melody played on the piano. Just a handful of notes. Clean. But layers are added gradually. Each layer changes the mood slightly. The guitar adds a level of youthful energy, for example. The strings, maturity. The piano, purity. It layers and builds until the song feels like it's going to explode. More and more notes, instruments, melodies. Each more beautiful, sorrowful or bold than the last.

Then the counter-melody hits at the song's climax; it's a french horn so powerful that it makes the hair on my neck stand up. It's beautiful but raw. It's heroic but also tragic. Triumphant against terrible odds. 

And suddenly it's all taken away. Joy is fleeting. And we're left with the song as it began. A single piano. The only way I can explain the way this moment feels is that it is like a musical tragedy. One that could only be achieved by giving you so much right before taking it away. You feel empty. It's gone.

And even after you feel like the song has taken everything, it takes more away. The piano plays the melody in its simplest form; two sorrowful notes at a time. Echoing.

Lonely. 

Almost like and whisper, or perhaps a memory of what there was.

And then, in an instant, the song vanishes. And, I don't know why, but I feel regret.

Hauntingly beautiful. Masterful.

I never had a problem, and I pretty much always had perfect pitch on my notes. Maybe I was just a really gifted Bassoonist. I shoulda stuck with it. Its a pretty cool instrument and can sound beautiful, especially when given a good counter-melody. 
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2011-03-02 21:44:28 PHNS<br>* Melody refers to the main melody of the song. The harmony is what accompany the main melody. Harmony in general just refers to many notes at once, like in a chord. One of the notes in the chord is the root, the most important that defines what kind of chord it is. For example the note G in a "g minor chord". The rest are just harmonies to that note. The bass is sort of a harmony, but has a somewhat different purpose I guess. To not confuse you further, let's from here on call the "harmony" I spoke of in the earlier posts as "<b><u>counter melody</u></b>". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-melody 

* Harmonic minor scale has nothing to do with harmony. Just think of it as a name for the scale. You should not use different scales for the different parts, since that will cause too much of a dissonance. But try it and see for yourself. If it is an effect you want it may just work. It is not to uncommon to mix the minor and major scale at the same time to create ambiguity. But in short, use the same scale. However, you can change scale whenever you want, as long as it suits the song.

Listen/watch this fugue to further get the concept. It starts with an exposition of the melody and then plays along for a while. At 20 sec the melody starts over in another octave and the voice that previously played the melody now play a countermelody. 40 seconds in the melody starts in another voice etc. You should clearly see when the melody starts over if you don't hear it.

Unfortunately I'm still fairly amateur at the uke, but I'm learning slowly. Usually my songs are constantly growing, so I may change it, I may scrap it, I'm not sure yet.

As for our other songs, you know, the ones where I know what I'm doing and don't have to reaffirm myself for because I've been a musician for eight or nine years doing this nonsense, I play extravagent time signatures. In one song we have alternating 5:4 / 4:4, with an a-rhythmic bridge and a 9:4 outro (not alternating.) Another one we have a 2:4 melody with a 6:8 counter-melody.

First of all, I love working with student composers (I'm engaged to one) and I play the cello.  This means I have a lot of opinions on quartet music that I've refined etc over the years, take it or leave it, these are all just my opinions as someone who is not first violin.
First, play around with ranges of instruments.  experiment with having the violins play something low and growly while the cello plays really high.  Get a good feel for the range of the cello and viola - we both do read treble clef and can play as high as any violin should (any higher and it hurts my ears!  haha).
Second, don't write a concerto for first violin.  Maybe pass melodies between the first and second violin, or give the cello or viola the opening melody or a second theme etc.  A lot of people get stuck in this rut of first violin = high melody, second violin = harmony to this melody/<b><u>counter melody</u></b>, viola = arpeggiated chords or off beats, and cello = bass line down beats.   This gets boring for anyone who isn't the first violinist.  
Third, experiment with different textures/techniques.  Maybe not in all pieces, and probably not in this piece, but play with pizzicato, bartok pizzicato, col legno, bowing below the bridge, slapping the strings, left hand pizzicato, false harmonics, octaves, the list goes on.  
What I'm trying to say is, this is a great piece with lots going on harmonically, but stretch that into really using the instruments more.  Stretch the players and the listener.  
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2011-06-28 04:38:35 Ovuus<br>I start with a melody. I write lyrics. I then develop an alternate melody and counter-melody. I set the metronome, and record the guitar melodies. Then the bass. Then turn it over to drums. Then record the lyrics.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2011-07-01 04:04:36 tone12of12<br>I agree with the Bard, here. The piece is very rhapsodic, which is fine, but somehow the different sections don't quite hang well together.

Also, the accompaniment patterns are good, but the strict repetition of them gets a little old. Try to find ways to give slight variations to the rhythm. This is especially true of the final reprise at the end. Also, since the piano part is relatively simple, there's plenty of room for it to pick up the melody or a counter-melody.

As for your form, have you considered making this a rondo? It just occurred to me that you could add a variation of the main A section at 82, then elaborate what you currently have at 83 into a larger slow section. This would help the continuity issues that have been raised.

Anyways, good work. Keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2011-07-02 09:34:05 Hoessayoh<br>Lose the distortion. Use a steel string. Otherwise, it's great.
Also, if you could make the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> (like the one that starts around 1:11) more pronounced, it would be sweet.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2011-07-03 09:33:18 ITalkToTheWind<br>I think it depends on how distinctive and important the parts are. Bass, drums and rhythms usually aren't considered part of the composition unless it's the main riff(s). If you make a lead part that's essentially adding another melody to the song (and isn't just based off a vocal melody), I'd say that could probably constitute co-writing. Backing vocals are usually just harmonizing the melody, so no, but if it's a really distinctive counter-melody, maybe.
</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriters</b> 2011-08-06 04:42:07 WorkHarder<br>Listened to the first track... 
What I liked: The high vocal part has a cool vibe to it.  The shaker coming in adds a really nice vibe and gets the song moving a little bit more.  The bass drum is a nice touch as well.

What I would recommend: Add something with a melody line prior to the vocals coming in.  Also, you could use a counter-melody to go along with the vocals.  There are a lot of rhythm tracks and given the relatively slow tempo it's causing the song to drag a little.  Also, it's a one way build right now, I'd like to see a little more ebb and flow along the way.

For example, in an orchestral arrangement the composer would generally come up with a chord progression/key as a guideline first. There are certain chord progressions that are very standard in popular music in Western culture. Let's say the first bar in the arrangement is a C Major chord. The composer would then decide how he wants the chord to be voiced. I.e having the 1st clarinets play middle C, the low brass play E above middle C  and the flutes play G two octaves above middle C. The composer can play with all the different combinations of notes/instruments and pick his favorite 'flavor'. It is important to note that there are certain specific ways that are traditionally used in  arranging these voices, but this is the general idea. Then, if there is a melody part, say in the flutes, the accompanying instruments may play a complimenting <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or chord in the same key. Now, a composer may deviate from this at any point, but this is the general idea. 

Songs are built around chord progressions based on the scales that you are most likely learning about. This is why learning your scales is so important!

Now, from a guitar- bass perspective, the bass can add a lot of variation. A guitar playing a G major chord could be accompanied by a bass note and become a 7th chord. Also the bass could add more of a note that the composer wants. In rock this is used a lot to make the guitar sound heavier. Generally in rock and blues the bass might play an arpeggio based off whatever chord the guitar is currently playing. The best example of this is a I-IV-V 12 bar blues progression, used in a ton of blues and rock 'n roll music.

I hope this makes some sense.

I play both guitar and drums, so when I listen to music I can choose to focus on either of those, and the more I practice drums and guitar the better I get at listening to them and understanding what they're doing. The same thing goes for the producer of the music. I can listen to a guitar and say "I like that counter-melody he's playing there", and the more I engineer/produce stuff the better I get at saying "I like what the producer did with the snare drum" and things like that.

As for structure and overall feel for your songs I can safely say it's just weird enough to keep me into it. I'm now listening to 'Sleep' and I can't help but feel the urge to watch Blade Runner again. Love it.

I thought 'Markovnikov' was a fantastic 8 bit piece. Really weird Excellent pads. The sound of the lead melody is perfect over top everything else. Mixed with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, damn, those are good. I really like this piece.

I was kinda expecting in my head for an arp or a xylophone or something along those lines to come in after the intro with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the bassline.

I didn't really like that you just used the same sample from the intro again in the body of the track. It would have been cool if it switched maybe to a female voice talking about the same topic as the intro sample.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2011-09-09 01:50:39 ultrauber<br>I think you really succeeded in that. However, you have a similar problem to a lot of musicians around here (including myself) in that there's not enough variety. It does "fall apart" in some different ways, but when it gets put back together, it's the same old song. For instance, when the stuff comes back at around 0:59, I want to hear more intensity. Make the bass louder, and give it a fuller drumbeat. Perhaps have the melody do a double-time kind of thing.

I really like the counter-melody that comes in at 1:15. I think you should play up the relation ship between this and the other melody from the beginning more. You start with melody A, then B comes in like you did. Then, make it so both melodies are happening at the same time on the same instrument. Then have one come to the surface, and then fall away again. Use phasers and whatnot.

Whatever effect it is that begins at 0:35 is really neat, it's a flanger right? I think you should use it really big-like that first time but then not use it again, like you did at 1:06 and again later on. It gets annoying pretty quick.

This track has a nice groove and you made good use of the tools you have. It just needs some more color.

I love your musicality and the contrast between guitar-guy's face and the other one. Sagerian noted that it sounds messy, and I think this is because you use the same "tricks" throughout the song. In the chorus, for instance, don't do the beatboxing. Instead, have the backup sing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. This will separate out this section from the rest of the song.

With the break after 2:40, you could stop for a little longer. Give the song a moment to breathe and you'll create tension at the same time. Then when the end bit comes in with like 3 vocal lines at once, I think there should be a change in instrumentation as well. If you have an octaver pedal, you could play bass there. Then have your beatboxer do more of his kick drum. This is the climax of the song and you don't want it to sound like a verse.

Anyway, nice use of the looper pedals, and I think it's clever to use those effects on the vocals. I also dig the guitar tone - it's reminiscent of a hollowbody - very mellow but punchy all the same. Is it 3/4 size? It looks tiny.

As with writing, the pace of a story can change, along with intensity and other emotional attributes. 

Sorry, this sounds really fucking esoteric, but there was a lack of resolution. The glitch bit at the end didn't do justice the steady build up. Perhaps try shifting the glitch to the start or coming back to it, etc. Perhaps look at a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in to bridge the build up to the glitch. 

Sorry for the ramble - hope it makes sense (and is helpful).

This will give you a good foundation of western harmony which is used in a lot of popular music today. If you want to branch out on your ideas, take an early music class or read up on it(look at stuff before the baroque). Almost all pieces composed then were polyphonic (each part is its own melody) and modal because there weren't concepts of homophony (melody with accompaniment) and major/minor. Another good place for inspiration is 20th century/modern wind ensemble composition. Composers now are not really limited to keys, meters, tonality, or anything so there's some really cool stuff now. As far as arranging there are books out there, but they'll mostly talk about how to arrange for different skill levels, ensembles, reductions, etc. I'd just write and see what sounds good if i were you, plus theory will give you a good understanding of where parts should sit in an arrangement; Melody- high, harmony's and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>- mid  and the bass is the chord foundation(fairly typical arrangement)Here's some places to get started.

-[Theory](http://www.musictheory.net/)
-[Free online notation software](http://www.noteflight.com/) this has midi/ virtual instrument playback so you can hear what you wrote
-Free [scores](http://imslp.org/)- music in public domain. lots of classical   music. You can browse by scoring and look at small ensemble arrangements

As far as which is harder in the long run, it depends on where you want to take it. I know lots of bassists that just play root notes and fifths for every song, and I know lots of guitarists that just play power chords and do some mindless shredding.

The true bassists are the ones that can deliver an excellent <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the vocals, while still holding the rhythm down. The great guitarists are the ones that know when to lay off on the solo, and how to put the song ahead of their ego.

TL;DR - bass is easier at a fundamental level, but when you start getting to really understanding and playing music, neither is easier or harder.

Yes, twice. Both times were great.

&gt; im talking about this song not avicii. 

&gt;this isnt even an avicii song

I know, but he referenced Avicii in the title, who uses a similar style of a repeating melody with filter sweeps on a white noise type sound with reverb in the background. Avicii's melodies don't change much either in his songs and he might have one counter-melody that plays, if that. 

Also, from a mixing standpoint, his tracks are kind of muddy. It's more clear on reference monitors if you have them. It seems like he only takes his time separating the kick and the rest of the components into two sections, applying compression to the rest of the mix when the kick sounds to get the "ducking" effect. 

Many other artists clearly spend much more time layering their sounds and mixing their tracks. But, of course, they don't have melodies as catchy as Avicii's.

the intro is kinda useless for DJs, put some drums in there. the first build up is interesting and sounds really good and those chords it drops into are HELLA NICE. ooh the build towards the end of the first drop is really nicely done and the way it drops to that filtered piano is perfect. next part is pretty long but i think you manage to make it work.. oh, up until the drum part. sounds pretty boring and out of place imo and the part where it drops down to the piano after loses its impact cause you already did that. the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> where it the kick etc comes in at 5:24 is really nice but by the time it drops properly you've pretty much revealed your whole hand via fading stuff in and there isn't that much of an impact. the second drop should be like, the most intense and you especially need a BIG payoff after such a long buildup, you want people to be going crazy by that point.

overall nice work dude. the effort you put into making your first track a good one clearly paid off. you seem to pretty much get the whole tension and arrangement thing that's so important in this style of music and to have managed that in your first track is pretty impressive. the kick is fine, the high end sounds a little messy but i suspect that's just the soundcloud streaming comression... uhh didn't realise this was downloadble, should have done that... mixing and mastering are both fine. make more!

Actually, no, that is incorrect. Often times Maynard serves as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the main melody. In fact, the three tonal musicians are often doing different melodies. 
</p></li><li><p><b>homestuck</b> 2012-01-05 01:55:39 HiddenKrypt<br>Look into "Music Theory". Practice improvisation. Try out different chord patterns and see how the "feel" together. It's the difference between drawing still-life for years then suddenly deciding you want to draw something unique without reference. It's pure creation, though it can be done as an act of creative chaos or methodical production. I used to have some music theory infographics, but sadly they're on a hard drive 1600 miles from me at the moment. 

It's all about socially instilled values. We hear major chords as "happy", and minor chords as "creepy" or "sad", because our social experience have assigned those emotions to that sort of music.  Similarly, there are emotional connotations to certain chord progressions.  Over the years, certain patterns have arisen as sounding really good, so they've become very popular.  For example, [the classic "four chords song"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I), follows the pattern I, V, vi, IV.  The Axis of awesome simplifies it a bit.  The songs they do in that video all follow that pattern, but they're transposing them to fit the right key.

Basically you can start with any chord you want. That's your root, the 'I' in the I, V, vi, IV.  The 'V' is the fifth note above the root, and the rest follow like that.  That's a start. On piano, you have to choose how exactly to play that chord, if you do the dancing pattern like in "more than a feeling", or if play the whole chord on every quarter note, or just portions, then you have tempo, rhythm, and more. As you play with your chosen chord progression, you can build something unique.  In most modern music that would serve as the base for the music, over which you would create a melody. This is typically a single "voice" series of notes. That means that it would be something that could be played on a clarinet or sung by a vocalist. It should use the chords as a guideline for what notes can be done, but it doesn't need to be restricted by just that. You have to play with it a bit to get what you want.  A second counter-melody can be added to support the first, sometimes forming chords with the main melody, or just filling in the spaces left open by the melody.

The idea of wanting to skip the gameplay of a game just seems so odd an inclination to me, just like wanting to skip the narrative portion of books or skip the dialogue portion of films or skip the counter-melody of a song. If the game is made properly and utilizes it's medium then you would be stripping out a vital element of the game.

I think that the fact that it would occur to a developer (and especially a writer) to *want* to strip the gameplay out of a game is an indicator that the story and gameplay are too separated and shows a fundamental lack of understanding of how to craft game design. If the gameplay has nothing to do with the narrative the correct answer isn't to allow people to skip the gameplay, it's to better integrate the gameplay into the narrative.

</p></li><li><p><b>explainlikeimfive</b> 2012-03-04 15:37:45 wewtaco<br>First, I'd like to point out that a good musician is **always** watching the conductor. Sometimes it is out of peripheral vision, so when it looks like the musician is looking at the music, they are still watching the conductor. Actually, when a musician has practiced the music enough that they are performing it, they usually have the majority of the music memorized, and they can actively watch the director for the majority of the song. Now, why can't they just play the notes and tempo?

1. Try singing your favorite song right now. Then try listening to the actual song. You will probably notice that you were at least a little bit fast or slow. Imagine 10-100 or more people each starting at slightly different tempos. They're going to start getting way off very quickly. The conductor tells the musicians when to start, and exactly how fast to start at.

2. It is very hard for a human being to keep a steady tempo for ~~longer than~~ very long, depending on the person and the piece they're playing, especially when there are lots of different things being played at the same time (melody, harmony, counter-melody, percussion, and possibly more.) It's like playing 4 different songs at once. Plus, people have the natural tendency to play faster as they play louder and play slower as they play softer. The conductor is there to prevent that.

3. In many songs there are things called fermatas, which are symbols that basically tell the musician to hold the note until the director says to stop. There are also tempo changes, where the song gets faster, either suddenly or gradually. The conductor tells the musicians the tempo that they will be changing to.

4. Cues. When one instrument starts playing a part, the conductor will cue them in, which is basically reminding them that they come in at that time. This isn't strictly necessary if all of the musicians are counting the beats perfectly, but because people are people, they sometimes accidentally lose count. The conductor is there to help them  get back to where they should be. The conductor will also cue the music becoming louder and softer. This is also should not be strictly necessary, but it helps the musicians play how the song is intended. For instance if the song goes from medium volume to loud, the conductor will wave his arms bigger and conduct in a way that helps the musicians think of being loud. This is much like a personal trainer at the gym: A personal trainer could say "Go lift that 100lb bar 20 times" and you would do it, but you would do it better if the personal trainer yelled at you, said things like "you can do it", and encouraged you. That's what the conductor is doing, he is encouraging the musicians to get in the mood and play louder.

There are some other reasons, but those are the big ones. Almost any musician that has played in a band with more than about ten people will tell you that it is nearly impossible to do it well without a conductor.

*Edit* I feel I should explain my reasoning. 

“Where is my Mind?” is a really, really simple song. It's four chords with no variation whatsoever. What made the original good was (a) Black Francis’ deranged vocals, and (b) The Pixies’ trademark "loudquietloud" dynamic shifts.

This cover just turns the whole thing into a grade-school level piano piece. There's no dynamic range, there's no attempt to introduce any kind of counter-melody. It's just the sort of piano tune that impresses people who don't listen to much outside the sphere of popular music.

PS- OK well since Izltah got the tenor/alto down (i'm just going to call them that lol) I'm going to list the notes for the soprano... the melody that you immediately hear when you start the track.

A B E A B F# A B E A B F# A B E A B F# A B E A B A2 A B G# A B E A B2

Maybe I should bust out my macbook and stem it out on garageband. I think I have the number of notes right, so let me know.

PPS- also the octaves are obviously wrong, only right relative to each other.

This is just my personal preference, but I get lost in these types of arrangements if the theme varies too much and doesn't "come back home" toward the end to remind me what I was supposed to be listening to.  My only suggestion for improvement would be to have one final verse at the end like the beginning were the melody was complete with the other voices playing harmony and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  I really liked when all the voices were playing together.  The other issue I have is with MIDI not being able to play with the intensity that you've set up in the arrangement.  Real musicians would be able to add more tension to the dissonance were MIDI falls short because of its methodicalness.  Thank you for letting me listen.
</p></li><li><p><b>bestof</b> 2012-03-27 11:59:00 [deleted]<br>You just described pretty much all genres of music over time. This isn't hip hop/rap specific. 

&gt;Original compositions.

All music derives from other music. Jazz, Rock, Hip Hop. Whichever. Hell. Led Zeppelin sold massive amounts of records by basically ripping off Willie Dixon for awhile. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, its a tradition that dates back to classical music. There is only a subjective problem if you don't do anything different. Sampling is an evolutionary step of this process. Producers take ideas and re contextualize them. Change tempo, pitch, sample a melody and play it against a melody from a completely different genre to turn it into something new. 

The same way there are only a certain number of chords on a guitar. At a certain point, all you can do is take the sounds and put them in new orders to create something new. This principle applies to how hip hop beats are made. 

Take a few hours and look through [Who Sampled?](http://www.whosampled.com/) and actually see where these samples come from. You'll find that the samples **usually** don't sound similar to the original recordings they came from. On top of that, you'll find samples from almost every genre of music imaginable. There is a deeper, richer appreciation of all music types from hip hop that you won't find in other types of music. The people who are interested in where the samples come from (and there are alot of people like that, including myself) get turned on to alot of music that they would otherwise have ignored or never discovered.  

&gt;Musicians who play instruments. (Clicking on samples doesn't count.)

I've heard this argument too many times. I can't direct this at you per se, since I don't know you or if you play an instrument. But this argument almost always come down to ignorance and people who aren't familiar with playing music or creating it. I play piano, guitar, bass and dabble in drums. This is in no way me saying that my opinion is of a higher value, or that I know more. But I do write and record original music, and I have alot of music software on my computer and I have tried to make samples. It is damn hard to make something that sounds good. People assume that there is some magic sample button and all people do is make a few mouse clicks to create rap/hip-hop. Creating beats that have samples and sound good, takes a long time. Producers need to have a knowledge of music to be able to make it well. Almost all drum tracks are created from scratch, with the people who make the beats programming it themselves or get a drummer to play what they create. If a producer decides to digitally create a sound, they still have to play it. If you're not familiar with it. In layman's terms, you pick a sound setting. But then you actually have to play it to record it. Digitally created music uses [Midi Keyboards](http://altomusic.com/shop/images/product/99005300600-86bae4e604f8dfa6eafc74e64a26a942.jpg). So when you hear a bassline in a beat. If it isn't played live by a bass player, its created by the producer who played it on the keyboard. This tech has developed so far, I bet you wouldn't even be able to tell the difference of which is live and which was MIDI. The point is. You have to be able to play music to create it. You need to understand melody, phrasing, tempo, chord structure, harmony. The exact same things you need to know to be a proficient live musician, are the same things it takes to be a proficient producer who makes hip hop or rap. Saying they don't play instruments is just disingenuous, they play instruments. It is just not traditional instruments. They're playing a keyboard, instead of a piano note, you're hearing a bass note or whichever patch they use. 

&gt;People who can sing.

Can't argue there. Rhyming is not singing. But that is why I like it. It is something different. But if you think they are just rhyming words together and doing nothing else you are wrong. They do the same thing a singer does. In their case, they're not singing but speaking to the melody they come up with. They speak to a unique melody that is offset from the musical melody, creating a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Alot of people get the impression that rhyming is some sort of monotone thing, of people never changing their pitch. It isn't singing, admittedly. But it does require talent and an ear. The fact that they can do this so differently from one another, without singing, and creating their own unique phrasing and counter melodies, is one of the things I respect the most about people who rhyme in hip hop or rap. 

&gt;Variations in tempo and pacing. Key changes. Other musical tricks.

Tricks? Those aren't tricks. Those are technical components of music structure. And for the most part, they are identical in all popular music.

Intro - Verse - Chorus - Verse - Bridge - Outro. Those all exist in hip hop the same way they exist in Rock or Pop music. I think maybe what you're talking about is a tendency for some rap/hip hop to find a repeating idea and stick with it for awhile. I can admit they do that alot. And their are certain groups who do it exclusively. If you think **most** of hip hop/rap does it, then you downright don't know what you're talking about. But that doesn't degrade the music. To me, it's no different than a traditional music band finding a groove they like and staying on it for a few minutes. Everyone has done this. Including some of the biggest selling rock bands of all time. 

[Classic song from a classic band](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4CzqrPZtXk). Reality - the same 3 parts played over and over for 8 minutes. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the song. But your criticism exists in all genres, so taking a jab at hiphop/rap isn't truly fair. 

[Classic Soul track with the same problem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwuO2dfqrF4) For the most part, the song stays on the same chords and the same BPM. The point I made before, that I don't believe it degrades the music if its the same thing repeating for minutes on end. If its good music, it doesn't need any "tricks".

And something I found before. To just reiterate the point that producers need to understand music to make it. From the future producers.com forum

&gt;Just so you know, you have picked a challenging piece to sample. JB's starts singing over the last half bar of the string intro. He doesn't find the 1 until half-way through the first "man's"......

&gt;You are trying to sample roughly 5.5 bars.........This means you are sampling over a 22 count. When you have the 22 beats sampled take the time (Let's say it is 12 seconds). To figure out the bpm, use this formula....

&gt;22/12=x/60
(22*60)/12=x
1320/12=110 beats per minute

&gt;This tempo is not correct for the song in question, but you get the idea. It will get you fairly close and then tweak from there until it sounds right. I know that you just want me to tell you the tempo and to be honest, I am tempted, but then you wouldn't learn anything. If you are really into production, there are certain things you are going to have to teach yourself. 

&gt;Also take a moment think about the above equation. If there are 22 beats over 12 seconds, how many beats are there over 60 seconds? 

But of course. These people aren't "real musicians" because they don't play a guitar or a drumset. Amirite?

&gt;A composition should develop, not loop four catchy bars over a disco beat

Already covered this. Its true in some cases, can't disagree with that. But there are plenty of hip hop/rap songs where it isn't true. 

&gt;Rap is a snore. There's nothing new and it doesn't go anywhere.

Thats because you're not looking. Great music in any genre is just not going to jump out and find you, you have to look for it. If you're judging the music by the radio, MTV, billboard charts. Of course you will believe that. The most popular music of a genre is usually the lowest common denominator. One of the greatest things about the internet (to me), is the fact that so much music is so freely available to hear now. There is no excuse to be ignorant about any type of music anymore.

I recommend you go over and check out [/r/hiphopheads](www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads) 

They are a friendly group of people who are extremely interested in underground hip hop that doesn't get attention from mainstream music press. Make a thread giving them your music taste and ask them to recommend some music.

I mean. If you've seen it develop for 25 years (the mainstream aspect of it) I can understand why you think about it the way you do. Hell If I was alive in the 50's and lived long enough to see Hair Metal. I would probably say the same thing about rock music. Point is, I really wouldn't compare it to hair metal, or make any bets that hiphop/rap is going to die off the same way hair metal did.
</p></li><li><p><b>moombahton</b> 2012-03-29 14:05:21 Frraac<br>I like where your going. I think the first most important thing i hear is there isn't really any low end. Be it the kick or the bass line there's no depth of sound. 

As gropswosh said it needs more variation, I think you could use the higher pitched <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to more effect. Such as after the climax drop towards the end. ya know like 32 beat after you could bring that to the foreground and make it the main point of emphasis. little things like that can take what you already have and show case it better than simply adding more for the sake of "something different". 

Hope that encourages. Nice work.
</p></li><li><p><b>bestof</b> 2012-03-30 11:53:50 AsskickMcGee<br>Thanks for putting in the effort or all the suggestions and explanations!  Your selections illustrate your point of "<b><u>counter melody</u></b>" much better than other stuff I've heard, especially the Pharcyde group.  I checked out more tracks from that album and really enjoyed the vocals.  Sweatshirt is less musical, but he still comes off as more of a vocal performer in a song and not a Slam Poet.  I had already heard of Mos Def and that led me to the BlackRoc project with the Black Keys, which I thought was pretty good. 

As you predicted, I couldn't really get into most of the songs.  I think almost all of them really do contain some thoughtful, original music (or original sample arrangements), but it's a very small amount per song and is repeated too frequently and with too little variation throughout each track for my usual tastes.  As you said, repeating the same four bars of content isn't an issue specific to rap (Smells Like Teen Spirit, anyone?), but it seems to be the standard in rap.  If I want to listen (and I often do) to a homogeneous rock song with no progression whose objective is more to "create a mood", there are plenty of options, but they represent a small subset of rock music.  Rap seems to do this as a rule, which seems like it's too narrowly defining itself.  

This is especially obvious in percussion.  I'm a sucker for varied, technical drums, but the snare/bass/hi-hat combo seems to be the most standardized thing about rap, and none of the beats seem to deviate very far from standard jazz ones.  Of course, this is also not specifically a rap thing.  One of the reasons I find it hard to listen to most Latin or Country music is that I find the percussion to be boring.   

I'd be a jerk to reply to such a big, thought-out list of recommendations without giving you some of my own. It's hard to compare musical tastes with just words:  

- Streetlight Manifesto: [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyhIjhIsh0I&amp;feature=related), [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rBCAB5Jews), [3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wwjd8V0uK8I) Often dismissed as just another "punk with horns" Ska band, they really like to use key/tempo/timing changes and bridges in a lot of their songs, and it keeps things interesting.  

- Deer Tick: One of the more Country-sounding bands I like.  Listening to any given album gets a little monotonous, but they have several great songs with wonderful progression throughout the track. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZrm_qkyllY) is an example.  Also, they make me drink whiskey.

- Mastodon:  Not a metal fan in general, but I love this band.  Each member (especially the drummer) is very technically sound, and you can feel your beard growing when you listen to them.  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Su1YXQYek) is one of their more popular songs.  While he doesn't really sing, their vocalist is much better to listen to than general metal screaming and grunting, and you could probably justify his skill using the same rational as with rappers.  

- Anamanaguchi:  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHmYC8a_4cI) was my favorite result from the "Show me some electronic music" thread I started, and is one of the purely synthetic bands I'm starting to listen to.  

Edit:  Let's throw in [Diego's Umbrella](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTiBN1U9pjY&amp;feature=relmfu) and [Tapes n' Tapes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UDAK0nD74Q) for good measure.

I've always thought full-on classical samples would be awkward in EDM but you've nailed it by using the bassline as a supporting/<b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

Only advice I have is that I would've liked to have heard a counter-melody included by at least the 1:30 mark.  Something with more of a pure voice that served as a contrast to the vocoderized main sound.  Great fucking job regardless!  I love artists on this reddit!

</p></li><li><p><b>Metal</b> 2012-04-04 19:32:54 RideTheLTrain<br>Hi! I'm another metal keyboardist, so I might be able to offer some advice here.

In general, playing keyboards in metal is very different to playing keyboards in any other genre of music. Your classical piano training will help, but you'll find yourself having to stretch musical "muscles" that you didn't know existed. Also having to adjust to how guitarists (and bassists, and drummers) think can be challenging.

&gt; What is the process normally like for writing music with your band? Do you collaborate on the entire song?

Like TheMoreIThink said above, it depends on who you're working with. In my experience it varies; sometimes someone will come in with more or less a complete song and it's just a case of fleshing it out. At other times different band members will bring in riffs or ideas and we'll stitch together a song from those. E.g. the guitarist will have some bombastic riff and then I'll come up with an epic string line to play over the top of it.


&gt;It seems like most genres' keyboardists are playing chord progressions not so different from the guitarist, but metal keys seem more classical in nature. Is this true or is there a lot of jamming to chords?

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "jamming to chords" but I'll try to answer anyway... I guess it depends what style of metal you're playing. I'm in a progressive metal band, and it varies, usually depending on what the guitar is doing. If there's a heavy guitar riff or something like that I'll generally play something different, e.g. some long chords over the top, a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, or accenting certain parts of the riff.  If there's a simpler section, e.g. the guitarist is just playing some power chords, I might follow the chord progression. It all depends on the sound and texture you're going for at a particular point in the song.

My personal philosophy is that metal is normally built around heavy guitars, and you shouldn't try to change that too much or it will stop being metal. You've got to find a balance between playing too much and being obnoxious (I've always thought Jordan Ruddess is guilty of this a lot of the time) and not being heard at all (way too many examples to list!).

One thing you might not have considered is that you'll be doing a lot of patch changes (i.e. switching between different sounds on your keyboard). In a given song I might use 5 or 6 different sounds, e.g. strings, piano, synth lead, a different synth, distorted organ... You'll want to have keyboards that allow you to play a variety of different sounds. I personally have a very unusual keyboard rig, so I'm probably not a good source of advice on what gear to use.

Good luck though! I've always thought there's not enough good metal keyboardists in the world!
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2012-04-08 22:50:41 ckaili<br>One of the best ways to get yourself in the mindset of improvising is freely singing over a chord progression. A simple example is the chord progression in Pachelbel's Canon.  It's repetitive and you probably already know it.  Just play that in the background and sing a melody (or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>) over the chords.  Experiment with range, rhythms, consonance and dissonance, and always keep your ears open and analyzing how your singing either works with or clashes with the chords.  

Another thing you can do is play songs that you like and try singing the lyrics on an improvised melody (over the same music), and really get into it.  It's actually a lot of fun and is something I do in the car a lot.  Doesn't matter if you can't sing well.  And this is actually really good practice because then you can also think about things like phrasing and emoting, things that are often swept aside as an afterthought when you're playing an instrument.

Don't worry right away about translating this to piano, because ultimately, improv is about developing your ear first (understanding what's going on around you) and the confidence to respond to it with your own voice.  Doing this on the piano is then just a matter of playing what you hear in your head.  In fact, many of the greatest jazz piano improvisers actually hummed or sang along aloud as they improvised.

There are lots of things you can learn to develop the "vocabulary" of your improv, like scales.  But you shouldn't worry about that at first.  Those things won't help you until you become comfortable with the listen-and-respond process.
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2012-04-12 10:29:29 FunkMetalBass<br>I had this whole long response written out, and then erased it, so I feel like that sort of explains it. Haha

I'd say that improvisation is always there to some degree, and it really has to be. Despite what we strive for, the studio will always be a place for experimentation and hearing things like you haven't before. The drummer may omit a fill you'd planned to rhythmically copy, the guitarist can change his solo tone and ruin your distortion settings, and sometimes you just really hear that quirky chord in context and realize that your amazing counter-melody doesn't jive well at all. Nothing is finalized until it is recorded.

Every situation is different, so I can't say there is any definite point of finalization. I've had situations where root notes and the occasional fifth were perfect, and so it was finalized before I ever actually played it. I've had situations (okay, only one time) where I'd worked on a bass line for a month, but was told to "let loose" in the studio, and virtually improvized 5 takes, only to have the engineer and guitarist piece together all of their favorite parts into one amazing bass line.
</p></li><li><p><b>guitarlessons</b> 2012-04-15 13:39:40 Pepe_Shenanigans<br>Buy a book of simple guitar duets.  Berklee method books work well.  A sight singing book would work well also.  Sing one line while you play the other line.  This can be difficult at first because the two lines will be moving in opposite directions.  I started doing this and found it to be the best way to go about it for me. If you can sing a melody while playing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, you can surely play chords while you sing
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2012-04-19 11:13:13 Willravel<br>Of course beer. 

What I do is I set the midi to play through Logic and sort of look through different instruments, playing the melody or progressions I liked to see when it sounds just right. 

If I land on something orchestral, I start working on harmony and maybe <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, then expand to a second melody, maybe in the dominant, put in some transitions and a codetta, add some broth, a potato, and baby I've got a stew going. Or rather an exposition. I really hope one day I can churn out a fully symphony that I like enough to let someone see. 

If I end up going more electronic, say electronica, I expand the melody to cords and get to work on the beat. I usually follow the accepted forms of electronica pretty closely unless I'm trying something experimental. 

If I end up doing something more like a movie soundtrack or other program-type music, I tend to do things a lot differently. I'll immerse myself in whatever it is that's caught my interest, like a story or poem or image or video, and just experience it over and over and over. I usually don't end up at the piano until I already have some sounds in mind. 
</p></li><li><p><b>reddittotp</b> 2012-04-19 16:35:28 darknessvisible<br>First off, amazing job.  

Secondly - I don't want to nitpick, but if this is going to be the official reddit track there are a couple of problems with the 8th note figuration that could be tweaked.  In measure 4 (and all subsequent appearances with the I V vi V harmonic sequence) the last four 8th notes are currently incorrect (according to common practice conventions).  The chord is G major, which makes all four 8ths uncategorisable nonchord tones.  This can be rectified by changing the 8th notes to tones that are in D Major (i.e. D Fsharp or A).  A D A D would be the obvious choice but then it creates parallel 5ths and octaves which is a bit gauche.  So I think the better option would be to change the chord to C Major for that last half measure of the phrase.  

When the figuration returns in combination with the second harmonic sequence (vi IV I V) it needs quite a few alterations to fit with the chords.  

[Here are my suggestions](http://www.noteflight.com/scores/view/0935a44611ba6388dd3ef284374fa69fe999abd5) for the tweaks - the second version is quite different from the opening figuration I know, but I've tried to do it so the top notes make a simple <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.   

But great job overall.  
</p></li><li><p><b>startrek</b> 2012-04-27 12:24:48 BromanBrolanski<br>VOY. I like the twinkly <b><u>counter melody</u></b> string sounds that crop up in the background. The best is when Voyager goes through that swirly green nebula. So chill.

</p></li><li><p><b>AskReddit</b> 2012-05-08 08:58:04 flashmedallion<br>That song!  After it earwormed into me, I was forced to sit there learning how to play the melody on guitar.

About a week ago, I was killing time at my parents place in the evening, noodling the tune out on the piano.  I suddenly hear a counter-melody coming across the fence from next door on an electic guitar, and I go to the window and there are all these guys drunkenly belting out an approximation of the lyrics.  They all tip their beers to be and I return the gesture with my brandy, and we duet the song for what must have been a good half-hour.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2012-05-30 08:27:39 Tuner89<br>Ignoring the source, the chords are really blocky, ESPECIALLY when the brass comes in. Add some <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and variety in motion between members of the harmony perhaps?

Range is another issue, Most immediately noticeable when the piccolo comes in for a solo near the end. A Picc is not going to hit that low C very well if at all. That entire melody should be given to the Flute in my opinion, and perhaps transcribed up an octave(so it sounds the same)

Listening a second time, now that I have a score in front of me and the pause ready to comment, The piccolo coming in on the initial theme is virtually inaudible. There's no harmony, no contrast, and no real difference in timbre. This also reveals to me that your score is marking the picc and flute in the same octave, which is a mistake, and makes a good chunk of your piece actually impossible to play as it sounds.

The clarinet line is nice. A little droney at parts, but that sounds like the midi more than a real issue with the part. 

I still don't like the entire brass section, and I feel that it should be removed or improved on. At the very least, create some motion leading up to it, because an entire brass section coming in all at once is a very powerful thing, and it feels like this was just thrown in.

The horn melody is nice. You do some cool stuff later on as well with the brass, it just seems redundant to have so much unison with so much potential given the size of the ensemble.

Near the end, I'd feel that runs on some isntrument, probably a woodwind, horn, or violin, would be a nice touch adding some more motion. 

Over all, it's pretty good work. I think you should work out some brass lines though, and compose some <b><u>counter melody</u></b>... Maybe tease at the brass theme that will be featured later, earlier?

If you have questions with what I mean, comments, or insight, feel free to reply and I'll probably talk more if you care =)

I don't have any criticism aside from the fact that I don't exactly know what you're curious about gaining perspective on. Some composers incorporate orchestral instruments into music making (You mention in regards to short films, videogames etc.) , so it all depends on the direction of the piece, and its ultimate destination. 

Learning which instruments to "double up", and what octave to have them playing is almost as important as the composition itself. For example, I might add some sort of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on the higher end of the piano part or add in a woodwind section. It all depends on how you define your orchestra.

All in all, great job. I'm following you on soundclound. Hope to hear more very soon.

As far as the track goes, I don't know exactly what genre you are trying to go for. I would suggest that if you haven't picked a genre you are shooting for, that you do so. It could use a lot more elements. Bassline, atmosphere, other instruments for <b><u>counter melody</u></b>/chords/arps, percussion, FX and anything else you can think of. It is very one-dimensional and has no real "hook" or theme behind it. Try to come up with a structure that isn't overly complicated or long. Listen to some of your favorite artists and try to emulate some of what they do and add things that truly "add" to your song. If you have only been working with FL for one week I would also recommend you reasearch how to use and get the most out of your DAW (learn the ropes). One of the best, if not THE best and most fun way of learning what things are and how they work is to experiment with them for yourself. As you progress, you can then go on to learning the things that you still are struggling with or do not understand entirely just from experimenting.
I could ramble on forever about this so if you have any questions feel free to ask.

"Dada Dada-a-aaah?"

And you could answer it a descending riff -
"Da Da, Dada, da DA."

Usually I pick one major synth like sylenth or ableton, get my sound and then use operator for sub and then use simpler for a sample I might make myself from a guitar or it can be from a sound library..I mix it all together using hpf,lpf, eq, ohmnicide, auto filter, make a few custom preset macros to a knob and then have a variety of the layered sounds of the one combined synth playing at once, separate and maybe another macro to a hpf to all create the illusion of instruments coming in, cutting out, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>,motion to make it more interesting all on one layered synth line. (One of many tips that is standard practice in most productions) 

 Once you learn what ableton can do there are tons of shortcuts that make it fast, fun and creative. In another daw one might achieve this same thing by making three or four tracks, copying pasting and then cutting parts out of a line and arranging for other instruments to come in and finish melodies in different spots...Sounds like a lot of work and cpu power vs putting in the hard work,doing the sound design and flipping a button allowing things to be more creative, live and fluid. 

Seriously just look at the youtube tutorials on how to make sounds you like...On the way there you will learn all these little neat production tips at the same time. Make yourself do a few a week or take a hour or two out of your day just to do it...by the time you get to writing you'll know a bit more and have more fun. Short days/few hours tutorials/learning. Long day/8+hr writing :)

I like the vocals, very smooth. He sounds like someone I would like to sit by my bed and sing me a lullaby every night. You would do well to bring up the volume and clarity of the drums in the recording to match the vocal track. Actually, the vocals are louder than everything else, that should be addressed. I like the backup vocals too, nice tight harmony. It'd be nice to hear the guitar carrying a more interesting part, perhaps a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> instead of the constant, cliche strumming pattern. Did you record this in stereo? The lyrics are relatively original, I'm not sure why but I feel like this song is especially suited to metaphors and hyperbole if you want to put that in there it would be well received. Overall the song sounds very genuine, I feel like you're one of my friends who's proposing to his long time girlfriend in front of me (though that also may speak to the production quality). Nice guitar, that's the volume level it should maintain throughout the song, not just while it's being showcased. The drums sound a little bit like the drummer just put the whole thing on a loop and left to go get a sandwich halfway through- there's just not a whole lot of interest going on back there. To be accepted in the commercial circuit you're going to have to bring up the production quality, definitely, but you'd be a welcome breath of fresh air so I encourage you to invest in doing so.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2012-07-22 21:57:48 cwbass4789<br>Of course, you're going to start out imitating the music you listen to. It's natural and everyone does it to some degree. 

Here's some random thoughts of things that I've found to be extremely helpful that aren't typical answers on this sub.

The biggest thing that will help you improve which I rarely see around these parts is that you need to experience this music on a sound system. This means going to parties at clubs and/or illegal warehouse/tent raves depending on what's around you and your age.

Let's be honest, with a few exceptions, the majority of dance music is meant to be played on a sound system. You need to understand how the sound system effects tracks in order to properly produce tracks for this environment. 

When you go out, listen for any tunes you recognize and compare how you are used to the tune sounding with how it comes across on the system. Eventually you'll start to pick up more and more of the tunes being played and you can go home and compare them. Knowing your speakers and monitoring equipment vs a sound system is incredibly valuable for bedroom dance music producers.

As a follow up to that point, it's all about drums and bass. You want people to dance right? Groove gets them up on the floor. You should be able to mute all the other elements of your tunes besides the drums and bass and still have it be an interesting captivating listening experience. The top leads and samples are just icing on the cake.

Listen to lots of different kinds of electronic music. Often people start out thinking "I want to make Dubstep!" or whatever and then they decide that in order to carry out their vision as a "Dubstep" producer, they need to only listen to and make Dubstep. It's silly and it's not a good way to create an original sound.

By expanding your listening habits you'll find new influences that help you to create an original sound.

Simplify! Try to keep your tunes to drums, bass, lead, and 1 other track (pad, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, sample, etc.) at least initially. If you can make an interesting tune out of 4 elements you're saving yourself a lot of work in the mixing stage. You can always add background elements and other sounds too, but it's easier to get things sounding right and then add the backgrounds than trying to mix down with 15 tracks going on.

Experiment with using multiple reverbs and delays to create different subtle layers of space. Bus channels are the best way to fake a cohesive room sound with midi synths IMO and you can do some very cool things using multiple verbs and delays in very small increments.


Learn how the notes you're playing relate to numerical frequencies used by EQs and Filters. You don't want to be boosting and cutting random frequencies, you want to identify problem areas and cut/boost those specific areas in order to remedy your problems.

I got about 4 sentences into your reply and could tell you are obviously a smart person (I of course read the whole thing) and I am currently listening to The Orchids and I enjoy it, which is interesting since I tend to have a very eclectic taste in music and it is very hard to predict what I will end up liking. What do you enjoy about the song? I love music... I was initially going to go to college for music composition, but I still write music for piano. I know when I listen to music a lot of times I will find something very small that I absolutely love about the song... it might be something that only lasts like 2 seconds, but I will keep listening to it over and over. The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in what sounds like a midi oboe I really love. With the pulsing xylophone that continues throughout the song... it is such a beautiful contrast of this weaving and flowing melody combined with the sharp hits of the xylophone. What is it that really draws you into it?

You are right about the endocrine system playing a role in your autonomic nervous system responses. But that specific pathway is a "fight or flight" sorta response. Times when I get really shakey is when my adrenaline has been pumping... which again is the whole "fight or flight" sort of feeling. Like after rock climbing for the first time I have a small fear of height, and after I got down I was shaking all over my body because of that response. I do want to say I am really glad to hear from you. I was wondering where you went and I am really happy to get a response.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not a pro but these are tips.


Pro tip 1: You'll be on an emotional roller coaster through the whole thing. Just be aware of that. 

Pro tip 2: The music program that you use might not sound good when it's played back. Try actually playing the measure or phrase on a piano (if for piano or with multiple instruments) or the instrument that it's for. The Sibelius playback on my shitty sound card makes it difficult for me to imagine the actual sounds that will come from the instrument(s) because of the gross MIDI sounds.

Pro tip 3: There's no order to doing it. I (Oboist, Violist, Horn) tend to think of the melody/counter-melody/harmony before anything else. My dad (Pianist, guitarist) always has the chords first and maybe the melody. My friend (Bassist, Tuba, percussionist) thinks of a cool bass line and builds on it. You start the way you feel is best and the rest will come to you. 

Pro tip 4: see Pro tip 1
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2012-08-05 10:34:48 Willravel<br>This is a really difficult question to answer. A lot of my inspiration comes from other music. I was watching The Fountain a few years back and a series of three to four chord progressions struck me as nice, but the composer didn't really use them again. I took them home and wrote a few leitmotifs. The leitmotifs were soon part of a melody, then a melody. Then I had a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Before long, I had the framework of an exposition. 

What you have to do is work at it. Sit down at the piano with a few ideas and just make mistakes and think about what does and doesn't work. Once you get that spark, the rest is just chipping away at the excess marble, to use another art metaphor. And don't be hard on yourself if you can't write the next great symphony. Writing orchestral music is a singular challenge. I can't tell you have many terrible sonatas and symphonies are sitting on my hard drive that will never, ever see the light of day. 

In short:

&gt;I lose the ability/interest to continue creating.

You need to overcome this.

You could also harmonize the cello and the violin together. So if you are arpeggiating a C major chord, have the Cello start on a C, and the violin start on an E, then play the arpeggio. I don't know if there is an actual name for this, but of someone can, please enlighten men. Just an idea for you. Otherwise maybe you could use the cello as a bass and play roots of chords, or roots and fifths, and the violin could be used for <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or a harmony part to the vocals. I like the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> idea better though. These are just some ideas. If you don't understand anything I said here just message me and I'll explain.

But for skrillex to put so many different elements into a single song,a sub bass,<b><u>counter melody</u></b>,mid bass, lead. Instruments placed perfectly like strings or piano in a song that has hard grime is pretty complex and impressive. And yeah,whatever, he "isn't real dubstep".Cool. Although I know it's complicated to make any type of music, with about a week,a 15 dollar LFO program and a drum machine, I could re make a "real dubstep" track easily. IMHO it is not all that complex.
But no matter how hard I try,I could never skrillex like skrillex does. No one can, and no one ever will.
</p></li><li><p><b>IAmA</b> 2012-08-20 05:03:02 kasmith2020<br>Every conductor does it a little different, and there are MANY schools of thought on what is right, wrong, effective or ineffective.  I can only speak from my point of view (which, being a young graduate, is heavily influenced by the mentor I studied with for two years)  

Mastering one's actual conducting technique is the hardest part (it always evolves throughout your life).  What you look like on the podium with the baton in hand, how you move the baton, what your gestures look like, facial expressions, etc.  A professional ensemble can read into the most subtle gestures and you must be able to control your body.  There is also a lot of coordination you must master.  For example, conducting a crisp pattern with the baton and smoothly gesturing a crescendo in the other hand can be a difficult skill to master.  Some conductors do just pick it up (rather, they do not study the craft exclusively in a school setting), but many study it for years like a professional piano player would study and practice the piano.

Aside from the physical aspect of conducting, during school you also learn how to effectively study a musical score.  Unlike playing a single instrument, a conductor must be able to open a score and read the entire ensemble's music.  The real skill is being able to identify what musical ideas are the most important and to share that with the ensemble.  Being able to identify that, for example, the clarinets hold the primary melody and should be heard over the trumpets and trombones who play the counter-melody.  While I follow along in the score I don't read EVERY LINE, but I have learned to follow the lines I believe are important.  Every conductor has their own interpretation of the score.  One might like the counter-melody to be more present than another, or they might prefer to take one section faster than another conductor.  

The beauty of music is it is open to interpretation.  Often, the musical score is a starting place and it is open to interpretation.  Some composers throughout history are very specific in their indications (ie, "this section MUST be performed at exactly 160bpm" or "no instrument substitutions may be made") and others consider their score a rough outline of their idea, open to discussion.  

I hope this answers your question!  
</p></li><li><p><b>Jazz</b> 2012-08-21 10:26:25 KingCrimson250<br>Not a pianist, but a guitarist, which often ends up playing a functionally similar role (especially when you've got horns on the scene). 

As others have said, your main role is going to be comping. Try to fill your own "zone," as it were. I'm assuming you've got a bass player? If so, stay away from playing basslines. That's his deal, man. As a guitarist, I'll often end up omitting bass notes from the chords I'm playing if there's a bass player. Since you're a quintet, I'm going to assume you've got two horn players - <b><u>counter melody</u></b> will usually go to the second horn player. If not, then it will often end up in the guitarist's lap. You're there to fill the spaces, as it were. Add the colour to the music, round out the harmonic background.

Like others have said, the best way to figure out how to do this is by listening. Guys like Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner and Thelonious Monk are amazing pianists, three of my favourites, but their styles are probably a bit too idiosyncratic for you to be building off of at first. If this is your first gig as a pianist, and the quintet's first performance together, you do NOT want to go in there trying to sound like Monk LOL

I'm going to recommend two guys whose styles are pretty adaptable and would likely fit well with your situation.

The first is Wynton Kelly.

Here he's subbing in for Bill Evans on Kind of Blue. I'm sure you're familiar with this track already: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPfFhfSuUZ4

This is the highlight of an absolutely breathtaking album that seems to be criminally underrated by anyone who's not a jazz pianist or guitarist: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZsdGVYqGco

The second is the King of Bop Piano himself, Bud Powell.

Here's something from what I believe was his only gig with Bird:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8_A-e3_NaM

(That's Diz, Mingus and Max Roach on there as well)


Solos are very important to listen to because comping behind solos is the most difficult part. You've got to make sure they've got the foundation to play what they want to play, while staying out of their way enough to give them room to breathe. The head is similar every time, but you never know where the solos will go, and you've got to be prepared to build up or drop back at a moment's notice.

Speaking of solos, those three tracks also have some pretty incredible piano solos of their own - compulsory study for any jazz pianist, I'd imagine. 

Hopefully this will give you a bit of an idea. I'd be happy to help you out with anything else if you need it.
</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2012-08-25 01:25:25 Irrational_Entity<br>I don't give a shit if there's not enough variation for you. They wrote the part simple and good, and it stayed that way and I appreciate it. They don't flood the whole song with bass the whole time, and instead use open patterns that wait measures in between that have good syncopated rhythms to add tension and feel to the relative white noise of the verses. The bass almost acts like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> without distracting from the vocals, because without it, it would just be mashing drums and the rising and falling of the high pitched guitar noise.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-08-28 02:01:18 gecko2222<br>Well, let's try a creative exercise..

The piano is a two-handed instrument.  You can play a chord with one hand and a melody with the other.  Depending on how many notes you want in your chord, you may need both.

Now, to make your arrangment more interesting, play it only with one hand, both parts, probably the left.  You'll need to figure out when you can play chords to fit with the melody without being able to play everything at once.  Once you've got that, now you have a free hand to play something else new.  Maybe it's a different part of the main chord, maybe it's a doubled melody, maybe it's a counter-melody..

Just a suggestion of course, but a good way to inspire creativity is to give yourself different constraints to work with and go from there.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2012-08-31 04:13:55 triplizard<br>There's some nice stuff in there. Here's some super subjective feedback - please take or ignore as you like :-) - First of all, I'm not sure about the pumping bass sound you're using in the main parts (around 2:00 and 3:00). I think in this context, because the song is so simple, it feels kind of annoying rather than letting the energy of the drum/bass parts comes through. Also, with the very 80's melody part you've got, it kind of feels like a mis-match - i.e. if you want to go with a sweet 80's thing, then the bass should be much more melodic and varied, or if you want to go dubstep or modern, then the melody parts need to be shaken up quite a bit. The other big note I'd make is that you don't really have much going on in the mid-range - there's lots of room in here for a counter-melody, or pad or rhythmic chord thing to add some more contrast and variety. Also, if you're going to stick with a very melodic part, then I'd say you might want another section that changes key or introduces another melody (think "middle 8" in traditional songwriting terms). 

Still, though, for a newbie it's quite nice!

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2012-09-12 00:35:39 discobloodbath<br>The way I make leads is very indirect, but bear with me:

I typically jam out on some chord progression on a basic piano patch until im happy with it. This grows to include melodies, counter melodies, chords, harmonies, etc. Then I pull out the lowest notes (not always all of them), maybe drop them an octave or two, and find a decent bass patch. Then I start pulling the other notes out and splitting them among instrument patches. I don't always pull out a "melody line" and/or a "<b><u>counter melody</u></b> line" sometimes I'll pull out just a few note and use them as accents somewhere. 

If a good "lead" isn't just popping out at me by this point, then I've usually got an idea in my head. The funny thing about making progressions thin way, is that Incan guarantee the musical integrity of my progressions all together and then just pull oi the right notes with a super obnoxious patch, tweak it to fit, and bam: a lead.

Once I'm content with how it will all sounds together musically, I start tweaking filters and effects to make it mesh sonically. When I get to where I'm happy with the richest, most full part of my tracks, I'll go back and build everything up to it.

I have come across brass-wind instrument players that just can't/wouldn't learn to control their pitch, and always wobbled in sustained notes.  (Very often cornet players, for some reason)  I played baritone and took stabs at playing euphonium - it moves right along so sustaining is less frequent.  <b><u>Counter melody</u></b> moves along briskly.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2012-09-23 08:09:33 bassfetish<br>Not sure if you should post this here either, but my first thought is that the function of the bass can take two roles.  It can outline/define harmony and/or provide <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  The bass part will also help define style and also, by virtue of  harmonic tempo and rhythmic density, define your tempo and feel.  With those concepts in mind, you can start creating based on what you need the piece to be.  That's as good as it gets from me without hearing your melody...

The guitar idea, while not mind shatteringly awesome, succeeds on the ethereal feel that I assume you're going for, while the drum track brings in a heavy beat to make it more enjoyable to listen to.  The lead guitar, which does sound like youre dicking around but that's because you are, does a good job of  providing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and I'm sure is fun as shit to play.  So I like listening to this.

It's all about waking up and immediately wanting to both wallow in the joy of waking, and to wake up again and again and again.  

I don't have the time to do a full playlist because I have to go sing at church now, but I will come back and do a proper formatting this evening.  This is a great idea!

I feel like you could use the build up at 1:06 to bring everything down and go HAM for the next part.
I like where the song is heading, I'm not too sure on a genre though.

Some modern music that got me into modern music with multiple melodies simultaneously and connecting on harmonies in a counterpoint-esque way


http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=L2LHdzLUPa8#t=196s guitar in right and left ear playing different melodies, piano in the center playing a third separate melody


http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=adjFhVeOvzs#t=25s guitars in separates ears with different melodies, occasionally meeting for parallel 3rds harmonies. separate melody by bass in the center


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH4HIn5Pfvg this is basically a vivaldi or bach rip at the beginning. 


The point with counterpoint is to listen for multiple melodies at the same time that combine in order to make something more. The melodies are supposed to have contrapuntal motion which means they should frequently move in the opposite direction. So if one melodies notes start to go higher, the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> has notes that are going lower. The examples above are not exactly like the master Bach or classical counterpoint, but they are easy ways to start trying to listen for multiple melodies at the same time instead of just 1 melody over backing chords.

edit: Also, just listen to Bach because he is the man and a source of endless interest

A lot of it is lost in what feels like very forced "atmospheric" tones, which just pulled me out. Plus, noise. The choruses hurt. Favorite part of the album is the Final Cut sounding riff in In The Flame Of Error running as a counter-melody. Least favorite is unnecessary technical drumming. Chris Pennie is a hell of a drummer, but the songs felt so stressed with all of it constantly going on. You can tell in Afterman Ascension that Josh works better with Claudio to use the drumming to benefit the songs more as a whole.
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2012-10-18 06:18:25 FunkMetalBass<br>#1. You don't have to start on the root note, but you usually want a chord tone on the down beat. Many prefer to play either the root or fifth because, as a bassist, it's easy to muddy up chords by playing notes that result in awkward inversions, and those notes often mesh nicely. In jazz, you strive for the same thing, but often sacrifice letting go of the root/fifth on the down beats in favor of keeping the walking bassline fluid. For example, if walking down from Dm7 to G7, you may prefer to land on B, the third, rather than G or D, and continue down to hit G on the next downbeat.

#2. You can make a living playing nothing but the root, fifth, and occasional third. Those notes just expand your range of in-chord notes and can give you an idea as to which mode best associates with the chord. Unless you're trying to control the tension in a passage or writing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, I'd probably shy away from using them as any sort of dominant note and restrict their use as passing tones.

In the end, you just have to experiment around and use your ears to decide if something does or doesn't work.
</p></li><li><p><b>gamemusic</b> 2012-10-19 13:23:58 CrowingNevermore<br>It reminds me of Secret of Mana in a battle in the woods. I really dig this. My recommendation would maybe to add some deeper instrumentation within the flute melody/clarinet solo near the end, like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to add to the eeriness. I like the pitter-patter of the percussion in the background.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2012-10-22 02:14:26 IbrahimT13<br>Well, actually, I didn't really mean for anyone to really use this besides me, I just wanted some feedback (in retrospect, it would have been a better idea to disable downloads, but only two people downloaded it, so whatever).

Thanks for the compliment. Yeah, it's meant to sort of be a counter-melody, so perhaps that's why it sounds a little off. Perhaps I'll fix it up. I think what you're referring to is a Glockenspiel, btw.

Yeah, it was meant to be pretty dramatic, so I guess I succeeded on that front. Thanks.

And yeah, I have a soundcloud, but I don't use it too much. I might try adding some stuff though, so my soundcloud is: http://soundcloud.com/i-b-r

Using sounds I would use for my project ;) The lower synths could be a little fatter in my opinion. Like the airiness. The clicking is nice. Good low end. Your right the mix needs work, but isn't too shabby. You choose sounds that naturally sound pretty good. I would use a different string synth, or maybe just add a little bit of distortion (try Ohmnicide) to add a little grit and flavor. Love the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at 2:16, maybe try bringing it up a tad in the mix. Not feeling the kick...I mean it's ok, but sounds a bit stock. You should have a deeper sounding kick. So far weakest link is the drums. (And trust me I feel you, I'm not that great at them either). The rhythm is fine, but your samples could be better. The break is unexpected, I like it. Love the little variations in the lead...oohh a tempo change, you got me. I'm a sucker for those. Cool drums sound better when it drops and gets faster, but are a little to forward in the mix. Still that fast part could be up in the mix. If you really want to mess with peoples heads, do all sorts of crazy stereo panning on it. A left right alternation would be savage. Seems a bit empty when you pull back the strings...keep them there or add something else. Long drawn out notes or vocals would go nicely. Think the ending could be more dramatic. 

Cool track

</p></li><li><p><b>postrock</b> 2012-10-27 03:07:37 rDr4g0n<br>It's generally just a different melody that is played underneath the main melody. It's kinda have 2 separate melodies playing at once that intertwine and compliment each other. Heres the wikipedia definition if that helps: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-melody
</p></li><li><p><b>MusicForMusicians</b> 2012-10-29 21:54:40 ErgotSum<br>I love the instrumentation and arrangements these guys produce.  They often use long melodic phrases that can be elaborate without meandering too much.  Their stuff generally has a lot of counter-melody and a device that I'm not sure of the proper term for where a theme is repeated verbatim, but the harmony underneath it is shifted.  Kind of the opposite of a pedal tone?

I also love the way the bridge incorporates the "slot-machine" music without feeling too cheesy/heavy handed.  It's almost Zappa-esque.

Their best record is "The Styx."  This song is not from that album, but I thought I'd recommend it.   
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-10-30 05:27:27 TheFreshestEnt<br>I see how you could maybe hear that section as being somewhat like an invention, there was definitely some imitation and trading of parts going on but there is quite a bit of structural logistics involved in truly writing an invention.(usually it is built off of a single motive or phrase and traded between parts from tonic to dominant while adding a counter-melody and doing the same with it to complete the "exposition" and going on to develop the motive(s) in an episode and finally ending with either a restatement or a coda) 


TLDR; No, and No
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2012-10-31 00:02:00 Tha5thelement<br>I checked this out yesterday, but was driving so couldn't write out a full critique. Anyways, here's what I think:

- Dope sample, definitely digging the crackles    and grittiness.

- You've got a pretty good mix going on as well for what you have going on with this one, especially when the trap-style starts.

- I think you could have done a lot more with it as far as your drums go. You have a very basic pattern, which is fine for for perhaps the first three bars of each set of four, but the fourth (and if you're feeling adventurous on the 2nd as well) you could have added a slight drum roll or Tom roll, perhaps maybe even a few extra snare hits or something to to give it a bit more energy.

- Try adding some additional non-sampled instrumentation underneath the sample, perhaps as a co-melody/chord progression, or even a counter-melody. That would certainly add more diversity to the track as make it a bit more sonically captivating. 

 I could hear the track has a lot of potential but as is, it doesn't feel finished.

One thing I think would help the track overall is another lead instrument to counter the vocal and fill up some of the space during the big break. 
Having a guitar or pronounced synth line as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> during that break, and continuing on through that final climax could take this track to astronomical places.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2012-11-06 03:23:25 B_Provisional<br>My 2¢ for your game of twenty questions:

1. Both ways. Sometimes you have sound in your head before you start. Sometimes a you get inspired by exploring and experimenting with sounds. I usually try to keep both approaches in play while I make music.

2. Yes, but they mostly all sound bad. At least if you've been listening to pianos and properly tuned guitars all of your life. This is obviously a glib answer. There are quite a few people out there exploring [microtonal music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music), but its mostly a rarefied academic pursuit in our culture.

3. It is easy to generate sounds outside of the range of human hearing, but most of our playback technology focuses on the range of sound that we can actually hear. Sounds lower than our threshold of hearing don't really work on traditional magnetic transducer loudspeakers. Desktop speakers, laptop speakers, etc. are pretty much physically incapable of generating any sort of real sound pressure at these frequencies, and even large p.a. system with powerful subs can't good too much lower than our 20Hz threshold before they simply can't move enough air to produce sound waves. You can actually send sounds to speakers that are too low to produce sound, but the speaker cone will just undulate. It can be kind of cool to watch your speaker cone wobble to a 5 hz sine wave, but its also a good way to blow out your system. As far as sounds above human hearing, there is an upper limit on what sounds can be reproduced imposed by digital audio's [sample rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_rate). Standard CD quality (44.1 kHz) can produce sounds slightly above human hearing, but not much higher. If you want to play back dog whistles or what have you, you'll need to be working in higher sampling rates. See also: [Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem)

4. It depends on what kind of electronic music you are making and how you are making it. These days, it is all too easy to just get some loops and mix and arrange them into a song. You can make music without ever touching a keyboard or inputing a note of midi. Further, just about anyone can come up with a decent melody, hook, or bassline given enough time or patience. Making individual lines of music is really not all that difficult, especially in context of popular music, and can be done without a knowledge of theory. Where theory becomes important is when chords and arrangements come into play. While everyone can make an individual line of music, it is much harder to compose for multiple instruments playing together in harmony. If you're going to write electronic music with, say for example, a bassline, long chords for padding, a melody, a counter-melody (hook), and perhaps another synth line playing a rhythmic role, a basic knowledge of scales, chords, and chord progressions would be extremely useful. About the same level of theory knowledge necessary for composing rock and roll comes into play for much of contemporary electronic music, but some of the time, much less.

5. The keyboard is merely a data input device for electronic music. Composing with a physical keyboard or composing by pointing and clicking notes on to a piano roll has the same end result for sequenced electronic music. People are able to compose for different instruments and make it sound good together by using music theory, or barring that, dumb trial and error. It really doesn't take much knowledge to make a couple of synth lines sound good together. Simply just playing in the same key will get you by for basic compositions.

6. A) Something that repeats, as in a repeated drum sample or other piece of audio in a song that plays multiple times without changing. B) a pre-recorded musical phrase, usually containing a single instrument that is sold or otherwise distributed to other musicians to be incorporated into their music. Typically, these are 1, 2, 4, or 8 bars of music.

7. If they are a phrase, yes. If they are a single note or drum hit, no.

8. Who is "they"? Mixing consoles are most certainly used if you're have your album mixed in a recording studio. Many electronic musicians just mix in their home studios on their computers, though. Mixing in a professional studio can certainly yield great results, but it is in no way essential to the genre. Based on the sorts of questions you are asking, you really don't need to be worrying about this sort of thing right now.

9. Your statement is contradicting itself. Sounds that can be made on a computer exist "in real life," since computers exist in real life. People have been playing digital synthesizers and samplers on stage since before you were born, and the only substantial differences between using those devices and using a laptop are the interface and the complexity of the DSP involved. Laptop performances can be boring to watch because a mouse and qwerty keyboard are rather ill-suited for dynamic musical expression. However, with midi keyboards, drum pads, and control surfaces, a much greater degree of expressiveness can be brought to live computer music.

10. Those are in-ear monitors. They are basically very fancy headphones that allow them to hear the other musicians so they can keep time and put on a good performance. It can be very hard to hear what's actually going out to the P.A. when you're on stage. The traditional solution is to have numerous monitors (speakers) on stage that play back a mix of the music for the performers to hear. However, this really makes life a lot harder for the sound engineers and mixing engineers, since they have both microphones and speakers on stage, making for a more chaotic sound environment. Wireless headphones make it much easier for the musicians to hear what they need to hear, and make it much easier to get clean mic signals on stage without fighting with feedback and other issues that stage monitors can introduce.

11. Easier than what? Despite its seeming simplicity, pop actually needs to be very disciplined. Every single note needs to contribute to the song as a whole, it has to be catchy and enjoyable without being too complex, and the mix has to be very well engineered. While singers come and go, the industry pros that produce, record, and engineer most of top 40 music have been at it for decades and are some of the best in the business. While other forms of music get more critical respect, hits are where the money is, and therefor where the pros go. Basically, the bar is set very high for pop music.

12. It depends on how hard you work at it. Several years probably. There are certainly ways to get cheap and easy results quickly (using lots of pre-made samples and presets, basically), but this is a good way to hinder your growth as a musician and waste time that could otherwise be spent developing skills and knowledge.

* Super smooth intro

* Great drum choice. Really compliments the vibe of the song. I would possibly add a fast delay/echo to the rimshot/snare you're using on the 2nd hit. That would add a bit more to the track imo.

* Would love to hear a nice deep baseline running underneath the drums in an almost <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to your chord progressions.

* Great use of the stereo spectrum as well.

I see a huge improvement over the last time I critiqued you and I'm looking forward to what else you can do. Dope stuff.

Knowing how to play the piano becomes very useful here, because you can just fiddle around with different melodies and motives just by playing something in the same key as the track.

After hearing tracks like "Guitar Sound" and "Stay Crunchy" off of his last album, I thought that with album number three we'd be getting more songs that featured a single instrument as the centerpiece with the rest of the song supporting.  I will admit to being a little disappointed that there isn't quite as much "keyboard wanking" as there was in "Disorganized Fun".

That being said, this album kicks total ass.  Every song is rich, and so beautifully crafted; you can hear the love he put into every element.  Everything supports everything else, and nothing feels out of place, which is a hallmark of good music, and quite an accomplishment with the staggering number of voices in each track.  

Well done, Mr. Jenkees.

However, in the process of moving some clips around one of the lead synths (which at the time was just doubling the bass) ended up getting shifted over by 2 beats and in context it formed itself a completely new <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2012-12-05 23:05:42 ErgotSum<br>Not necessarily to build intensity; more to provide context.  I think of improvising much in the same way I think about speaking.  I can speak a single phrase (a single note line) and depending on the context, it can come across many different ways and with many different meanings.  With the guitar, I might have to play something before and/or after the line (whether they're chords or more single notes) to provide the context.  With the piano, I can provide it simultaneously (whether it's with a chord or a counter-melody or a pedal tone). 

I don't mean to say that the piano is "better" than the guitar, just that there seems to be a set of tools for adding complexity and dimension that is not available with the guitar.  It's like a little orchestra in a box.
</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriters</b> 2012-12-14 05:42:30 ChrisMill5<br>Your voice is interesting, sort of like Colin Meloy of The Decemberists. The instruments sounded good, but the mixing had a few problems. Around 0:45 it sounds like there are some guitars missing the punch in, and not intentionally. Around 2:25 I thought I heard the drums in a mistime. 

While I think your voice is good sounding, I don't think you're experimenting with your vocal melodies enough. I can't discern what part of the song is the hook, save the opening line. A voice like that is hard to harmonize with, so it needs to step up and become even more a focus of attention. 

And I don't think the heavily overdriven, hardpanned guitars are doing the song any justice. The tone is fairly sterile, but it takes up so much space sonically that there is no chance for an instrument <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or anything. Also, they kill your dynamics. The whole song feels like it's cranked to 10 from beginning to end. Give it some more space to be organic, and you might find room to make improvements. 

All I all, good song.

No one can really hear anything specific in a rock concert, it's all about your performance.  Make sure your sound man doesn't blow and do more than just play root notes or play along with the guitar.  Don't go crazy, no one likes an overly forward bass line, but a little counter-melody and the occasional fill doesn't hurt and can bring your sound out.  More importantly, just your physical stage presence is important.  Guitarists have the luxury of fast, impressive guitar solos to grab the crowds attention, even if they just stand still the whole show.  If you, as the bassist, just stand in the back next to the drummer staring at the rest of the band like "boy, they look like they're having fun!" then yeah, no one will be impressed by you.  Are you having fun while you're on stage?  Look like it.  At a concert that attitude is contagious and if the crowd can tell that you are on stage, having a blast and not giving a fuck who knows, they will love you for it.

</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriters</b> 2012-12-27 03:25:25 ChrisMill5<br>Good style, punchy instrumentation and excellent mixing. There's a Decemberistsque quality to the entire mix. I heard somewhere in the first verse, before the harmony, where the voice misses the desired pitch just slightly ("we found adventure"). When the harmony does come in, it's spot on, but just a little boring. The lead voice is taking a fairly conservative melody, so the harmony needs to do more than follow it in such a majorly melodic way. The harmony should take a counter-melody that creates tension and resolution, which will drive your song harder than anything else you have going on right now. Again, look to the Decemberists for examples of good melody/counter-melody.

But seriously, nice work. I would buy this track.

Think of the Strings as your foundation and the other instrument families as 'coloring' that sound. You can give each family a particular task (woodwinds, help violins with that ostinato; brass, help cellos and basses with harmony; trumpets, need a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> here; horns and trombones, get in there and support the viola line). That's one way you could think of it, I suppose. 

Also, remember that your loudest section of the strings will be the violins. Your softest section will usually be violas. So, where you have important lines in the viola section while the rest of the strings are doing something else, you can really support that sound in the horns, low clarinets, and so on.

I really like the composition, melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in this track. However at times it feels a bit too cluttered, without a sense of space. I think if it evolved slowly and the new melodies and samples slowly get added, it would create more interest rather than jumping straight in. This would also let the listener focus in on a few specific elements at a time, which would help the emotional message of the track be transferred more easily.

I like the bass in this track and how it kind of acts as a kick drum in relation to the rest of the percussion. However I think you should try and give more presence to the percussion and claps, as currently they seem a bit too fluffy and light. 

I would have to disagree with broski_ here by saying that I think the flute definitely suits the vibe of this track and I dont find it irritating at all.

Overall I really like the composition, vibe, and vocal snippets in this track, but a little work on the structure and progression of the track would make it even better. Great job.

There are a lot of rules, but the basics are laid out fairly well [here.](http://alanbelkinmusic.com/bk.C/index.html) If you want an old-school approach, Johann Joesph Fux's [Gradus Ad Parnassum](http://www.opus28.co.uk/Fux_Gradus.pdf) guides you through Baroque techniques (think Bach or Handel).

No AV system could make me enjoy Red Eye or Crunked Up though.

I do enjoy listening to them in an academic way. These are from first wave of songs that used subbass as the _voice_ of the music. This is the feature of dubstep that's lasted because it's the best. Before these guys came along, bass was intermittent beats, or not higher ranges of bass like in funk, or would include symbols and all sorts of smashing percussion. Dubstep is bass that you can move and hum to.

Read the wikipedia article on [bass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_\(sound\)). It still represents the old views:

&gt;Played in a musical ensemble such as through electronic music, rap or 'drum and bass' on a computer, or via an orchestra, **such notes are frequently used to provide a counterpoint or counter-melody**, in a harmonic context **either to outline or juxtapose** the progression of the chords, or with percussion **to underline** the rhythm.

Fuck all of that. Make the bass the melody, make the treble the counterpoint!

</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriters</b> 2014-01-23 01:11:59 summerlungs<br>Because you're choosing to do rock guitar instrumentals over drum machine loops, you will have to consciously work to avoid basically making something that sounds like a stock 'rock' loop from garage band.  I think it's important for any musician to be aware of the cliches in their genre of choice.  

Edit: after having listened through KB62113, I can safely say that you have avoided the stock rock loop death trap. 

*B Walk*

I love the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  It's so sneaky and understated.

This is basically a hook, with a bit of a build in tension at the end.  When I come up with something like this, I try to figure out what feeling it evokes, and let that determine where it goes.  I would be temped to say this is a good intro riff, but I think it suggests a sort of emotional uncertainty that might make it work very well as a bridge somewhere.

*Crazy State I'm In*

So here's the thing with solos: insofar as I am concerned, they are a commentary on the song in which they occur.  Someone once said a guitar solo should be self-contained and tell a mini-story within the larger story of the song, and I guess I agree with that, but it's still depending on the entire song's context.  

So as a songwriter, I don't really know what to do with something like this.  The lead is a lot louder than the rhythm guitar, and the distortion on the rhythm guitar makes it difficult to figure out exactly what the chord progression is.  Or at least when playing through my laptop speakers. 

I think writing a song around a solo is difficult and I am unaware of any bands that do this.  Usually it's very much the other way around.  Although the idea of writing a song around a solo is intriguing, actually.

B Walk gave me lots of ideas because it just presented a mood.  I feel like a solo is more of a response to a mood, which as I make sense of songwriting means it should generally come towards the end of the process.  

*Pocco 072113*

Now this I could do something with.  The rhythm guitar has a lot more midrange, so I can hear what it's doing.  This reminds me of a Chili Peppers-kinda song.  I can hear Anthony Keidis (sp?) coming in at any second and doing that weird sing/rap thing he does.  I think this could be a very good starting point for a verse; it's interesting and has a hypnotic quality, so it could just repeat for a while and let the vocalist be responsible for melodic progression.  

As to what happens next?  This is I believe one of my weaknesses as a songwriter.  Someone might be able to take this and construct a solid verse/chorus/verse without the chord progression changing,
but I'm the kinda guy who would have a pre-chorus and then a chorus based around a different progression.  

*Trains 0613*

I was about to say that this is another idea that I don't think I could do anything with, but then you introduced a new section right around 1:24 that made me rethink my musical reference points.  I was gonna say the verse reminded me of some of Danzig's solo stuff (the Rick Rubin-produced records, not the Industrial records), but I don't think Danzig does what this song does at 1:26.  

Out of all these clips so far, this is the closest to a song, i.e. it has structure.  It's emotionally evocative.  When I was auditioning for bands, they'd send me stuff like this and tell me to come up with a vocal.  If someone had sent me this, I would have been thrilled, because I think you have almost an entire song here.  It just needs a vocal and a little structural reorganization.  Before 3:19, when the chorus bit comes in, it sounds like you're not really sure of what you want to have happen there (and suddenly, BASS!)  This is when I think the singer has to do his thing, so you can come back to this chunk of song from his perspective.

*KB62113*

EDIT: I was thinking of 'Miss You', not 'Some Girls'

Reminds me of those Rolling Stones 'vamp'-ing songs, like Miss You.  Reminds me a lot of Miss You, actually, but that's okay because this is rock and a lot of shit sounds similar to other shit.  The guitar line that starts at 1:35 is good stuff.  This is an example of taking the chord progression and taking it somewhere unexpected.  In my mind, this is an indication of talent.  

And then the guitar part gets really close to the hook from Miss you.  I don't know if this was intentional or not, but I wouldn't sweat it.  The guitar part I just mentioned is not similar to Miss You, so just go back to that.  

I used to despair when I realized I had been subconsciously getting really close to ripping off another already-existing song, but now I just make note of it and try to 'say something else' while occupying similar territory.  

The guitar part at 5:30 is very good.  This reminds me of some of those extended Neil Young jams where he seems to boldly keep soloing until he happens upon something good, and then he kinda parades it around.  

I don't have time to do any of the other ones yet, but I'll try to do so later.  Where are you at with these song pieces?  Like, are you unsure of what to do with them?  Are you wondering if they're worth a damn?  Tell me what kind of comments would be most useful to you and I'll try to oblige.  

One parting note: you are obviously very technically adept at guitar, and I want to thank you for not making a huge point of making this fact known.  In other words, thanks for not overplaying.  If these were just chord progressions with a bunch of wanky soloing on top, I would have been dismayed.  You have a very good sense of when to keep things sparse and minimal.  I don't know how much you've played with other musicians, but this is basically a gift from God.  Some of the best musicians I know (in terms of chops) are also people I will *never* be in a band with, because they have a constant agenda of needing to let everyone within earshot know that they have skills.  At this point, I think a musician basically needs psychoanalysis to progress.  You don't do this, and that is fucking awesome.

On the contrary, just about all rap beats are written on a piano (in the form of a MIDI keyboard usually) with the exception of the drums obviously. The difference between rap and most genres is that other genres use vocals for melodies whereas rap uses vocals for percussion. It sets the rhythm and the beat. Often times black metal does this too. When the singer growls, it's not because its some sort of melody, counter-melody, or anything like that. It also sets a beat. So calling rap vocal-centric is pretty inaccurate. The difference is rap puts bass and percussion at the forefront of their music rather than any treble or melody (with the exception of trap beats). This allows them to rap at a constant speed, a bit like a metronome. I mean, Layla has more treble oriented music, but I don't think Eminem would sound very good rapping over that. Although he did rap over a mixed version of Time of The Season on his latest album. If you want a rap song that you can play on piano try Part II (On The Run) by Jay-Z.

</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2014-02-02 23:47:50 Illusi<br>Constructing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is *hard* to me. I've listened to what other musicians do and tried to imitate it. These are the things I picked up:

* In pop and rock, clear counter melodies are rare, but when I hear them they always make little patterns with thirds and seconds. Common movements are II to I, V to VI and III to IV.
* In jazz, counter melodies are comparatively common. I often hear them go down the scale while the main melody goes up, but halfway the measure they go down a seventh or a sixth and go up towards the root from there.
* All counter melodies go either contrary to the main melody (up when it goes down, down when it goes up) or parallel (down when it goes down, up when it goes up). To make a decent <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, choose a pattern of alongside and contrary (such as alternating between the two), play it a few times and then vary it.
* Edit: Also, from reading Briggsby's comment, the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> should rythmically fit with the rest of the song, as any normal bass line would. Vary only in tone.
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2014-02-03 00:09:37 btbambassman<br>I don't know too much theory so I don't have the proper descriptive language, but I love writing counter-melodies. Here's generally how the writing process goes for me:

1. Find the right place and time to use a counter-melody, this is the simplest and most important step
2. Start with just the root notes, know when and where the guitar changes. Play around with different duplications of these root notes to explore tone options
3. Begin filling in the gaps between root notes with some simple root, 3rd, 4th, 5th pasterns. Realize a general motion/melody structure you want
4. Add flavour by throwing in some 2nds, 6ths and 7ths or even off-key passing notes


It's tough to generalize, but this gives you a rough idea. Best way to learn is to listen to bassists who use counter melodies and to just fuck around during the writing process. Eventually counter melodies are just a matter of thinking of a melody in your head and your fingers automatically respond with what you want
</p></li><li><p><b>happyhardcore</b> 2014-02-03 03:21:52 d4rkwolf1939<br>Overall I love it, I think its a great track and you should be proud of it!
There are a couple of things I would like to point out that I would do differently or change. 

*The synth you use to introduce the melody sounds a bit flat to me. Its great for the initial statement of the melody, and even up until the first drop, but it doesn't add much on its own. I can't really put my finger on what it needs, but it lacks a lot of depth, I think.

*The melody itself is a bit one-dimensional. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I can hear where you could have some awesome chords going on after a couple repetitions of the melody line, or even a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> (although I feel like that might make it too busy, so I might shy away from that).

*During the break, when you introduce the melody again, I might filter it so that it sounds sort of ethereal and far away, and bring it back for the build, or even during the build and have it back for the second drop.

Other than that, love the feel of it, love the flow of it, sounds like at the end you've got it moving into something else which I look forward to hearing when you've got it all finished! Hopefully I was able to give some constructive criticism and didn't come off as a pompous ninny.

Edited for format.

I've been planning on making a similar post for a while now :P I may still make my own since I have some specific questions that I'm curious about--especially to see if any patterns emerge...but, on with your question.

Music is my life. I listen to music almost constantly. It shapes my emotion, and I will often pick music that fits my mood or that will affect my mood in the way that I desire. I am also drawn to instrumental music. I've always attributed it to the fact that I grew up on classical music, but perhaps its because I'm a sensor. Never really thought about that. With music that contains vocals, I find that the instrumentation is most important to me. A song must be complex in its structure for me to enjoy it; I've noticed that all my favorite songs have strong bass and a moving bass line or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Little wonder that I cannot stand to listen to most popular music and folk music :P

I'm a big fan of ratatat and bonobo as well :) And I prefer vocals that are very musical, which is more common of female singers, I think. I recently shared my music collection with my sister, and she was really surprised at how many female-led bands I had.

My favorite groups are Radiohead, Metric, Garbage, the Gorillaz, and Cake. Cake is one of the few groups were I actually pay attention to the lyrics. 

I discovered recently that I listen to much slower, chiller music than most people. (Thanks to pandora, I discovered my "soul-mate" music genre: trip hop. My proclivity towards trip hop is actually a bit annoying. I love discovering new music, and I have many different pandora stations for different genres. But if I thumbs up all the songs I like, the stations all converge. So I have to thumbs down songs that deviate too far from my station seed to keep my stations distinct.) I think this is because I get over stimulated easily by more high energy songs--they make me feel stressed and tired.

I'd like to add some of my newly found favorite songs, but grooveshark is down at the moment, so I'll add them later if anyone is interested.

It's a really complex process, and I started to really enjoy the multi-dimensional crossword puzzle that is rhythm, riddle and rhyme. Throw in melody, harmony, counter-melody and arrangement, and I can easily get lost in the process. Getting a decent recording program, or playing them with a band is really satisfying too. You get to watch them come to life.

It just seems like a repetitive bouncing groove that loses it's flavor the second time around. I'd love to hear some "improvised" breakaways or strong variations but what's there right now just struck me as a little bit too bland for how funky/jammin the overall track is. It seemed like it sticks out in it's repetition. That's just my opinion anyway.

Basically, as i underastood it,  when Eru and the ainur sung middle earth into existence, the ainulindale, and Melkor created his <b><u>counter melody</u></b> creating evil in the world, Eru sung a final note in the creation of the world to fix everything.

The hobbits were a part of that, they have been in existence, isolated, since the beginning of the world, the elves have records of that - the hobbits are a part Erus afterthought to fix the world, which is why they are so simple, hardy, and resistant to corruption.

Just adding in a counter-melody or well placed chords can change the music completely, like blending different coloured paints together.

</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2014-02-15 19:29:58 shrediknight<br>The left hand fingering is the biggest problem here.  Watch [this guy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKSg8t4zyLg) left hand and notice how it doesn't jump around nearly as much as yours.  Your current fingering is focused simply on getting the notes to come out, you need to adjust it so that the melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> are distinct.  Bach is nearly impossible to understand from tab alone so I suggest you at least find a hybrid tab/notes version with fingering so you can see the melody more clearly.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2014-02-16 01:24:34 dunzie<br>In the meantime here are some area I feel could be worked on:

The bass at about 1:00 seems oddly dischordant for a piece like this, maybe recheck that one?

Chord at 2:12 worked perfectly.

In the quiet section you repeat the phrase before you go to a fuller texture.  Might be cool to add in a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> over it.  Same thing when it occurs at the end as well.

Other than that the piece is generally good, especially for your level.  I remember teaching the scottish equivalent to GSCEs on placement and this seems a lot better than the compositions they were producing so well done there.

You might want to add a bit more timbral variety to it IMO.  The piece works well but maybe if you replaced bass guitar with a prominent solo cello line playing a slightly more exciting variant on that line it could really come alive.  Also maybe add some other higher instruments when it comes back from the middle reduced section.

</p></li><li><p><b>explainlikeimfive</b> 2014-02-22 14:26:46 dmazzoni<br>This is all true, but let's add a bit more.

For a professional orchestra, cueing everyone at the right time (not queueing, that means waiting in line!) is not that important - professionals know exactly when to come in and don't need to wait for the conductor!

Even for pros, the conductor does help keep the beat. It isn't strictly necessary, there are "conductorless" orchestras - but it helps a lot because it can be hard for everyone to hear the whole orchestra at once.

The conductor also balances the orchestra. During the loud parts, everyone plays loud, but if the conductor hears that the brass are overpowering the woodwinds, he or she can direct the brass to soften just a bit so that the audience hears the perfect balance.

Finally, the conductor's role is to interpret the music. The music does not usually give a strict tempo; the conductor chooses exactly how fast to play the fast parts, how slow to play the slow parts, how loud, how soft, how long to pause, and even exactly how to balance all of the different parts - one composer might really bring out a counter-melody while another will let the main melody shine.

By the end of it, he was a much, much weaker force than he used to be as Melkor during the time of the Two Trees. This is because Melkor poured his very essence into Arda and corrupted it. That's why there is still persistent evil in Middle-Earth, even through the Third Age. The work of Morgoth's corruption in many parts of Arda continued on well beyond his rule. So yes, his "counter-melody" was the corruption, chaos, and evil that he weaved into the very fabric of the world, and this is something that could not be undone by the other Valar. Even after Morgoth was captured, his legacy of corruption was guaranteed to continue on.
</p></li><li><p><b>Calligraphy</b> 2014-02-24 23:52:40 elchucotografo<br>I think a point is missing in the discussion here. Sure music can convey emotions and is communicative in nature as has been expressed in this thread and argued on both sides about meeting some kind of linguistic criteria or not depending on the point of view of the person posting. 

But music is more than that. It has syntactic and grammatical elements as well as lexical elements just as common languages do, but unless you study music a lot from a more theoretical point of view, this concept might be difficult to understand. 

A lot of music theory is based on concepts that to make certain sounds and convey certain moods, certain rules must be followed. Generally speaking, the more advanced the composer, the better command of these rules. Some composers however will have complete control over these syntactical and grammatical elements and choose to stay within certain genres, within certain lexicons of the musical theory.

Here's a couple of examples in more layman's terms:

A standard blues or classic rock sounding song is in many cases going to follow what is called a 1, 4, 5 progression. Meaning the first note in a scale (also known as the song's key) played as a major chord, the 4th note in the scale followed by the 5th. Everyone from the blues greats of the past to the Beatles to Muse to Justin Bieber have used the I, IV, V chord progression. It is a standard.

Now, someone a little more advanced might come along and say, "Well, I like that chord change progression, but I want to make it more 'bluesy', so what can I do?" The answer is to play a melody or counter-melody or solo in that same key's relative minor. So, a song that is a 1,4,5 in the Key of G has a relative minor three half-steps down on the music scale. And notes played in that relative minor, especially what's called a Pentatonic scale are going to sound 'bluesy". Adding techniques like string bends (syntactical elements) are like adding jargon or dialect to a language. Depending on techniques used in the actual manipulation of the instrument, I will be able to get different sounds.

Now someone might come along and say, that's too basic. I want to change this up. I want a moodier song in a minor key. So to get the minor, I use a flat 3rd step in the scale (half step down from III in the scale) to completely change the mood. Or I might add a step from the 2 to the 3 in the pentatonic scale to make it sound more 'country". I can do this if I understand the rules. If I speak the language.

Now this is just scratching the surface. If I want that kind of latino-bluesy sound of Carlos Santana, I get into different variations of the scale, specifically a form of playing called a dorian modal. On the guitar, to get certain sounds in your music, you can choose to use these scale variations. There are the following modals: Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian. The more of these that I am familiar with, the better my playing. Think of these sort of like dialects. Depending on who I want to speak with, one of these might be most appropriate, or not appropriate at all.

Again, still just scratching the surface. All instruments have their quirks and their elements that contribute to the lexicon. For instance, the nature of brass instruments is they are designed with a starting point (so to speak) in certain keys. It is easier for average players to play them and read the music from certain points of view. So, again in layman's terms, someone like B.B. King who plays with a lot of horns is going to choose keys for his songs that suit the background accompanying sounds - for instance instead of defaulting to the more common E/A/D keys found in a lot of blues, B.B. King likes using a lot of Key of F songs because that key lends itself to the "language" of the horn players and accompanying low brass. 

Other composers have such complete command of the musical lexicon that they just write things that are in whatever key they demand, and force the musicians to adjust no matter the technical challenges.  Some have complete command but stay within their genres (Jazz, Classical, Flamenco, etc.) Each genre has different rules in the music theory that you MUST understand to be able to play them effectively.

In short, you must SPEAK those theory languages to be able to do that.

Now, most popular musicians and people who do this for fun don't study music theory. They do all of this instinctively. They may not know why the song they just wrote works, they just know that it works. But what they have actually done is come across something like a "circle of 5ths" or first position chord inversions without knowing it. Let's face it, you don't have to understand the technical grammar to be able to speak and in a lot of cases to speak effectively. Eric Clapton doesn't read music, but I guarantee that he understands enough theory to get by at a high level and the patterns for the scales and chords that he uses effectively come from repetition and innate ability.

As you get into things like classical music and jazz, the languages become more and more complicated, regimented, structured and demanding. And within these "genres" there are multiple styles and sets of rules. Baroque music was quite different for example from the music of the Renaissance. It had boundaries and rules were meant to NOT be broken. The great composers of that time are defined by how well the wrote within the confines of all those boundaries. The great composers of later eras are more defined by how they broke those rules but still found a way to keep the music within some form of acceptability to their audiences and patrons.

In short, if you want to perform classical music at a high level, you have to study for a long time. You have to put the time and the effort and dedication to learning the rules, patterns, theory in order to do it. This is why they call it "READING MUSIC".

If you want to play Jazz, you have to learn the syntax, style, lexicon, jargon and voicings of jazz. If you want to learn Rock &amp; Roll, blues or country...you have to learn those rules too, because the really great musicians you adore speak these languages. Whether their approach is academic and theoretical or practical and autodidactic makes no difference. The language they are learning to speak is the same for all those who wish to speak in those terms.

I don't think I can put it more plainly, but there are literally MILLIONS upon MILLIONS of examples that I could state to make the point that musical theory is most definitely a language. And the reason that most people can't play music is the exact same reason that they can't speak Russian, or Spanish or Chinese. Because they haven't learned how.

The arpeggiated guitar riff with the bass counter-melody supports the entire song, and the rhythm guitar in gated (?) reverb helps give depth to the mix. It was foremost the riff that stuck to me because the stylings were very similar to DIIV. Gives a heavy indie pop vibe, more so than shoegaze. But overall a really diverse set of ideas, consistent tone, and good mixing.
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2014-02-26 08:23:08 Morgoth714<br>Well, as someone who plays a lot of progressive rock/metal, my advice is probably going too far for whatever style you're going for, but i'll give it anyway. 

Start by breaking the rules. Instead of playing an Am chord for example, try substituting the C for a B, or instead of repeating the same four chords, throw one in that isn't quite in the key you're in. Instead of repeating a riff, try making a section that has 3 or 4 different riffs back to back. Repetition is great underneath vocals, but no one enjoys an instrumental part if it loops over and over again. Throw in an odd time signature, or a key signature change at the end of a section. Try writing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on keyboard or bass to the melody the guitar plays. Instrumental parts are all about keeping interest, and that requires going beyond simple chord progressions and repeated licks. 
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2014-02-28 11:07:53 Holasic<br>Pads can help with that. Especially because because it can follow the melody without be in the front of the mix.

Though you say "not just a melody and a kick". Layering can thicken your melody by accentuate certain elements within that melody. Also a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is good.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2014-02-28 11:14:11 hellarios852<br>mind elaborating on "<b><u>counter melody</u></b>" please.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-melody

http://www.ars-nova.com/Theory%20Q&amp;A/Q116.html


So if I was writing a melody in quarter notes in a certain key. I would kind of write a solo in quarter notes that is in the same key but kind of acts like a second voice to the melody and they talk to each other. (Check out the clip)

I wish I could explain in better but as I said, I'm still learning music theory. The best way to feel it out is maybe loop your melody and play a random solo in the same key over it until you find something that sounds good.

&gt;

&gt;In [music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music), **counter-melody** (often **countermelody**) is a sequence of [notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note), perceived as a melody, written to be played simultaneously with a more prominent lead [melody](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody): a secondary melody played in [counterpoint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint) with the primary melody. A counter-melody performs a subordinate role, and is typically heard in a [texture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_texture) consisting of a melody plus [accompaniment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accompaniment).

&gt;In marches, the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is often given to the [trombones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombone) or [horns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_horn) (American composer [David Wallis Reeves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wallis_Reeves) is credited with this innovation in 1876. ) The more formal term [countersubject](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countersubject) applies to a secondary or subordinate melodic idea in a [fugue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue). A countermelody differs from a [barbershop quartet-style harmony part](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbershop_music) sung by a [backup singer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_singer) in that whereas the harmony part typically lacks its own independent musical line, a countermelody is a distinct melodic line.

But the length of the notes are just so that they are a beat divided in 3. If I used whole notes it's 1 2 3 4. If it's half notes it's 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;... Eights 1 e &amp; a 2 e &amp; a 3 .. C'mon this is rudimentary. I learned it in elementary school band on snare drum. Even if you go 123 223 323 the beats still the same length in fact you can go further to prove it's 4/4 by adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> of half notes for instance and it'll line up cuz it's still 4/4.

Songs with counter melodies I think are special because you're getting two (or more) melodies for the price of one.
Also, "Happy" has an undeniable groove that makes even me want to dance.

Okay opening seems solid to me. Personally I'd go with a low pass slowly opening as well as increasing the volume on the synth but idk

Counter-Melody at 0:27 needs bass. much more. needs a big gritty bass behind it IMO

like the arp. solid.

Beat starting at 0:55 seems really out of place. Needs to either be reworked or add another element as well at this point to make it stand out less

Section starting 1:29 is good, but feels like it needs more building up to at. The change is a bit jarring.

Post drop bass is rather harsh in the highs, could do with some more movement. Modulate it a bit, use that massive range you have in that sound to your advantage to turn a huge bass into a brutal bass.  

Really really like the hats at 2:17. Need to bring them in earlier IMO  


Overall i think you have good potential with this one. The smoke weed every day at the end made me laugh! (But personally id modulate the fuck out of that to make it sound like an interesting part of the song in its own right.  

Liked and followed. Keep at it! Hope this Helps!

"Hey it's verse chorus verse chorus bridge chorus coda"  
and it's that simple, OR you also say:  
"The second verse the horns take the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>"  
and so on and so on in exponentially complicating layers until you've basically re-written the original composition.  
A composition CAN be as complicated as a full symphony orchestra OR just a melody line.  As we all know (I hope) a good *song* is good with no instruments at all and just the melody stands alone.

One of my favorite things in the world is taking a local singer-songwriter acoustic guitar knows little about music person and blowing up their tunes into huge arrangements with all kinds of crazy arrangement layers and things going on.  But the composition is theirs and that doesn't change whether or not I dropped a thunderstorm at the end of it as part of the arrangement.

The only real difference is an arranger is using some source material that is not original. Think of Ben E King's Stand by Me .... That lovely instrumental string section was done by the arranger, there's a melody that isn't the tune. It takes the same skill set to write a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> as it does a melody.  Same to do a reharmonization vs writing a chord progression. I do both depending on who is paying.

I'm not trying to play a 1-second sample of a reverse cymbal crash, or a booming electronic bass drum.  I'm trying to play a 30-second acoustic piano accompaniment to the chorus of certain songs. I want to hit a trigger on the downbeat, and have a device that plays a pre-recorded trumpet counter-melody or background vocals.  All of these devices seem like they're made for percussive purposes and not for what I want to do.

Very nice, although you do not have to repeat lines or harmonic phrases 4x, 2x is fine. The best of the three selections

Watch their hands more closely and you'll see they are directing one another.  When one singer is carrying the melody, they will tend to pace the other singers with their hands.  You'll notice also if two singers engage in a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, they will tend to face each other slightly so they can hear each other's pitch better, but also so that they can get in sync rhythmically by communicating through their eyes and hands.

These are an engineering marvel, based largely upon technology from the 1920s, when these instruments had their heyday accompanying pre-sound films. In this organ, everything is electro-mechanical/-pneumatic, save an updated computer relay (the interface between the console and the pipes, percussions and other sound effects).

The Wikipedia article on [theatre organs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_organ) is a good start. The [American Theatre Organ Society website](http://www.atos.org/about/history/theatre-organ-4) has more information. 

Basically, the organ has sets, or ranks, of pipes—one pipe for every note on the keyboard (61-note manuals, 32-note pedals). In a theatre organ, ranks can be extended up or down by octaves, so as to give a wider tonal range. Each of these ranks can be made of different materials and voiced differently, so some imitate flutes, trumpets, strings, brass and other purely organic sounds. These pipe ranks are placed in rooms, or chambers, with venetian blind-like swell shades that gradually open or close to let more or less sound out (the pipes speak at only one volume). Each rank sits on a windchest, a wooden box with individual pneumatic valves under each pipe (activated by electromagnets) that open to let the air flow and a pipe sound.

On the console, the red, white and yellow tabs are stops, that allow the player to turn on a rank at a given pitch on a given manual. Stops are given numerical pitches based on the nominal length of the pipe at the lowest note on the keyboard; an 8' stop plays unison pitch—same as a piano—while a 4' stop is an octave higher and a 16' stop an octave lower. By mixing and matching these tones, the organist can set up various sounds or ensembles on each keyboard—similar to keyboardists on Letterman, but packaged into a discrete console and with real acoustic technology instead of synthesizers.

Now for the technical side of things. Each keyboard has a set of contacts under each key—think on/off switches—the signals of which are sent to a central relay. Back in the '20s these were electropneumatic computer systems, but many have been upgraded to digital systems with MIDI and record/playback. The relay takes the notes played and, noting which stops are on, sends the appropriate electric signal to the electromagnets on the windchest. For percussions and traps, it sends a signal to those as well.

Getting even more amazing is the device called second touch, which Jelani uses here to make it sound like he has three or four hands. On certain keyboards, typically the lower few), the keys can be pressed down normally (first touch) where they encounter a set of stiff springs. Pushing harder against these bring the keys down 1/8 of an inch into a second set of contacts (second touch). In this way, he is able to solo out a melody (or counter-melody) in the left hand—which is also playing harmony—while doing trills and frills with his right hand.

Sorry this is a bit long, but these are amazing instruments, and even better live, because the sound works with the room in a way that is audible and visceral.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2014-04-15 04:39:21 KtotheLeb<br>I usually pan everything both left and right to give it a more even sound, unless there's a lot going on in the song. However, this track doesn't have an overwhelming amount of things happening in it, so I would suggest panning everything left AND right. Hopefully this will help you understand what I'm saying more:

Drums                                                                      Drums

Something along those lines. Again be sure to experiment to find out what sounds best to you. And don't stick with the same panning for every song. Always try to switch it up.

And if there's a lot going on in the song maybe try something more like this:

                                       Vocals
                                      (Center)

Something like that. And I don't mean specifically those instruments. I'm just trying to give you an idea of how to pan tracks strictly to the left or right to give them their own space instead of cluttering the song. But sometimes clutter can be good, always have an open mind.

Hope this helped.

The brass synth that comes in is a little cheesey for me though.  The line is fine, the patch is just a little detracting.  Overall cool idea though.

Percussion overall is also fairly subdued, but that may be from the above issue.  Kick seems to get muddied up.

At 1:27 the long snare roll procession is a bit too long. hella hi hat rolls I think you could flip this beat in to some avant garde shit if you worked from that angle, cause it's not your typical trap beat. I'm not sure about the low bassy synth.

The piece is built of three main materials:

* Loud clusters in the piano, always in pairs, fast, and accompanied by the silent depression of the lower register of the piano.

* Melody in the cello part, which is usually built of held tones or in some cases double-stops.

* Counter-melody in the piano, which is usually built of diads, though sometimes single tones or even three- and four-note chords.

The first element is a dividing point, or cadence, that separates sections.  Saunders uses three of them: at the beginning, at measure 14, and at measure 19.  These three elements transform.  At first, they are thickest, then they thin out and become higher as the piece progresses.  The last of them, at measure 19, is a further reduction, with only *one* cluster instead of two.  Saunders is allowing these three figures to transform and re-define themselves as the piece progresses.

But Sacred Harp music doesn't have a soprano part; it has a treble part. The distinction being that men and women both sing treble. The tenor part, which is better characterized as the lead, is also sung by men AND women. So both treble and tenor are buried in the middle, and sit on top. Remember that earlier sacred harp music did not have an alto part. The BEST way, in my opinion to characterize the parts is as a melody, counter-melody, and a bass. This might help explain why the melody doesn't seem to be where it "should" and why the treble line often sounds so much like "the melody".

I'll often try to introduce elements before they fully come into the song. Sometimes I'll reverse stuff and put a really long delay onto it, then I reverse it again and the reverb tail of the reversed sound will build into the beginning the main sound. Hard to explain, but try taking a lead and then reversing it, and putting a huge reverb and delay on it, both 100% wet. Reverse it again, then put the end of that audio chunk at the beginning of where the part actually starts.

Sometimes it helps to try thinking of your track like its being played by a band - maybe you have a guy playing a lead that comes in during both choruses/breakdowns. What's that guy doing when he's not playing during the breakdown though? Maybe he's playing little fills or playing a counter-melody really quietly. Perhaps he's slowly building in volume and complexity of what he's playing as the build approaches, to lead into his main part.

Hardly a second goes by where you don't hear the 4 note motive. Even when the second theme comes in, it's still there in the backround. If you take a look at the first movement score as a whole, there is a big attack in the beginning, a period of softness, another big attack after the second theme, more softness, big attack, more softness, and a big ending. DA DA DA DUM on a large scale.  

I enjoy the 7th quite a bit, it's in a tie with the 9th for my favorite of his symphonies. The ~~third~~  second movement melody is so simple but so emotional and moving.

to keep it simple for you, for now just play octaves or power chords with your left hand. then put the chord in your right hand up top. you can mess around with inversions and stuff to get fancy.

try and voice the chords in your right in such a way that requires small hand movement so it kind of creates a counter-melody.

</p></li><li><p><b>gamedesign</b> 2014-05-18 18:26:19 Legitamte<br>Well, here's a few:

* Standard shoot-em-up, but your gun is like an entire arsenal all-in-one--every magazine has a completely different type of ammo in it that changes the function of the gun. Maybe your first magazine has 30 assault rifle rounds, but the next one has 4 armor-piercing sniper rounds, and the next has 3 bouncing grenades, and the next has 10 seconds of fuel for a flamethrower. A little window next to your ammo indicates your current magazine and your next magazine. Using this, you have to navigate a level with a variety of enemies, against whom different magazine types will be more or less effective, constantly switching playstyle to adapt to your ever-changing weapon. Maybe to give greater control, you can press a different button to discard the next magazine and "reroll" it after a short delay. Your enemy types can be recolors of your soldier asset to indicate their weaknesses and/or which weapon they use.
* The gun shoots a little light-ball that teleports you to it wherever it lands, and the player is tasked with navigating a treacherous series of platforms, traps and obstacles--maybe a bunch of floating bits, or maybe climbing the inside of a huge tower. Enemies are defeated by "telefragging" them. Maybe instead of the ball instantly teleporting the player on contact, it can bounce a bit, and only teleports when you press a different button.
* FPS meets bullet hell--enemy attacks take the form of elaborate patterns of slow-moving energy balls, forcing you to constantly dodge and weave around bullets (possibly in three dimensions?) in order to stay alive--maybe you go whole hog and say the player dies in one hit. The player's weapon is rapid-fire, but enemies can drop powerups that give it new properties (like spread, piercing, bouncing to nearby enemies, etc; for bonus points, the powerups could also bounce around the current arena and the player has to chase them down.) Maybe the player has a super meter that lets them erect temporary shot-blocking barriers, clear out all enemy shots in an area, teleport, or whatever. The arena rebuilds itself every round--new walls, new obstacles, etc.--so the player has to constantly adapt in their maneuvers.
* Standard FPS, but there's a DDR-esque "rhythm track" across the top/bottom/wherever of the screen that's synced up to the music. Your gun does pathetic damage unless it's fired on the beats, and your reload takes longer unless you do the same. Maybe enemies have their own rhythm synced to a counter-melody that determines when they fire. Texture everything in lots of trippy color patterns that also move to the beat.
* Not an FPS at all, but a first-person dating sim set in a space marine training facility. Impress other soldiers at the shooting range, form bonds in simulated missions, and try to manage a web of intrigue and drama while keeping your drill sergeant off your back.
* Similarly deviating from the obvious, you could do a murder mystery: your squad of super-soldiers is investigating a murder at a top-secret military research space station; there are saboteurs on the station, and you have to figure out who they are before they destroy the station. You have to explore the station, interrogate suspects and deduce everyone's loyalty to figure out whodunnit. The longer you take to figure it out, the more people the saboteurs kill and the more of the station they destroy. Being that you have very limited ammo supply, it's in your best interest to not employ lethal force until you are certain that someone is a saboteur. Lots of directions you could take the gameplay on this one.

Basically, the key component is musical theory. If you break down any song, you'll see there are certain combinations (or progressions )  of chords. And chords in turn are a combination of notes. What my brother does, is listen for those chord progressions. By doing that, it's quite easy to glean how the melody fits into the whole song. 

Beyond that, a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> (basically a counterpart to the melody) can also be put into it. 

With all that in mind, he then reproduces and sometimes adds to what he hears, thus "playing by ear". 

Hope this helps :)

When you've got it good there, start building the parts piece by piece. I like to start with the rhythm section, so bass and drums. 

Then add the melody/harmony. 

Then a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>

then some effects

then tweak the arrangement to have some variation

Then spend some time mixing it. Bam, finished. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-05-25 00:02:30 Salemosophy<br>Being able to understand "the relationship" (i.e. 'why' the movement works) between any two chords, using the following framework, makes it easy to construct chord progressions in real time. So, for anyone analyzing any tonal chord progression to see how it works (so you can reproduce it in some other way), these are also things to look for:

* Function - chords in tonal music function either as Tonic, Subdominant, or Dominant. 

* Primary/Auxiliary chords - Primary chords (i.e. I, IV, V) are related to Auxiliary chords (i.e. ii, iii, vi, vii) by common tones. 

* Common tones - notes that remain the same between two chords.

* 'Leading' tones - in a single voice, the movement by half step of one pitch to another pitch between two chords.

* Melodic Extensions - extended pitches (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, 13ths) of chords that occur in a melody/counter-melody are typically more "colorful" and tend to draw more attention than structural pitches (root, 3rds, 5ths). 

* Bass intervals - Loosely applied (so this is situational), bass voice movement tends to have a "progressive" or "regressive/stasis" effect on progressions. Progressive ascending intervals (2nds, 4ths, 6ths, 7ths) and progressive descending intervals (2nds, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) mirror each other. Regressive/Stasis intervals essentially "compliment" regressive intervals so regressive/stasis ascending intervals (unisons/octaves, 3rds, 5ths) and descending intervals (unisons/octaves, 4ths, 6ths) are a little easier to remember.

*Note: Not everyone agrees with the "bass interval" idea of progression and regression/stasis. But it comes from the simple idea (assuming the first chord is tonic) that when the bass proceeds immediately to another structural pitch of tonic, this creates LESS momentum than if the bass moves to the pitch of another chord. This is the basic premise of bass intervals and has proven helpful to me.* 

* Contrapuntal motion/preserving voice independence - if one or more voices move in the same direction, at least one voice should move in a different direction, with a different contour (steps vs skips vs leaps), or a combination of both. 

* Voicing simplified - most chords contain a root, a fifth, and at least one kind of "color" tone (usually the 3rd). Voice your root and fifth first, then explore to find the color(s) that work. 

Finally, a step-by-step guide to creating a progression from a melody/melodic fragment. 

1. Construct a melody/melodic fragment.

2. Construct a bass line. Analyze for both potential/implied function and melodic extensions. 

3. Flesh out the inner voices. Analyze for common/leading tones and counterpoint/voice independence among the voices. 

4. Analyze/edit for bass progression/regression/stasis and melodic contour/color against the harmonic progression. 

5. Details - let nothing be concrete until you are satisfied that every element/voice contributes its greatest potential to the whole. The smallest edits usually have the strongest impact. Be ready to change ANYTHING. 

Figuring all of this out on my own after 2 years of college music theory and 7 cumulative years of composition lessons has made writing so much simpler for me. I hope it does the same for others.

[Here's something completely different - a improvised song where the instruments are bass, violin, and mellotron.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiJstUNFM3g)  Notice how Wetton becomes the entire accompaniment.

[And a prog rock epic called *Fracture* that was recorded live.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrB-V5pkEAQ)  I love the way this one builds, and I love the way the bass and drums carry a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> thru parts of the song.

</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriting</b> 2014-05-27 07:42:17 schnitzi<br>I think you just have to hear it in your head.  It helps to not actually be playing the riff while trying to come up with a counter-melody, so record the riff then listen to it over and over until something comes up.  Later you can learn to sing and play it simultaneously.  (Excellent examples, btw; this sort of thing is something I definitely value in a song.)
</p></li><li><p><b>songwriterscircle</b> 2014-05-28 20:16:22 summerlungs<br>alright Layman,  let's do this.

Firstly-you are an appreciably-odd dude and you are willing to wear it on your sleeve.  I respect that a ton.  Cut from mine own cloth.

Do you own a Rhodes piano?  I think there was a Rhodes on the first song you posted here.  It goes fantastically with your voice; warm and round with a slight edge.

The Casio is very nice.  I think that's a Casio anyway.  

so this is a simple song that's armed with everything a song should be packing.  Compelling progression, effortless melody (which is two bars long; atypical and indicative of your skill).  Lovely chorus that actually recontextualizes the Casio melody as its <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, which is a very cool thing to do.

This song actually reminds me quite a bit of All the Young Dudes by David Bowie.  Same emotional terrain (but getting there from a very different place), the Casio melody actually sounds like a rewrite of the All the Young Dudes melody, and the casually breathless verse reminds me of the Bowie song's verse as well.

This isn't a problem; it's not similar enough to be liable (not really even close), and more than a few pop hits began as a deliberate rewrite of an older song.  And besides, Bowie ripped off Somewhere Over the Rainbow for Life on Mars.

A few things-

The vocals aren't quite mixed right.  The reverb needs to be darker.  The Casio melody should be frosting on the top of the Rhodes and your voice.  

I also think you should flesh this one out a bit more.  This is a criticism I had of the other song of yours that I critiqued.  I'd love it if you slowed this down a bit and made a hymn of it.  Some backing vocal harmonies on the chorus and maybe a big bright gleaming organ instead of the Casio.  

I think these changes would help this song do what you want it to do a bit more effectively.  This is a depiction of mundane normality with a wisp of something greater; the ghost of JD Salinger smiles upon you for writing this one.  

And so does the future ghost of Ben Folds.  Folds has a habit of depicting normality as intrinsically epic; the changes I suggest are something I think Folds would do.  It dials up the inscrutably anthemic vibe you have going on, and heightens the contrast between the subject matter and the production.

But besides all that, this song sounds a bit too demo-ish.  This is only because the song is more than good enough to warrant a bit more ornamentation.  As it is now, you bought someone the best gift they'll ever receive, but instead of wrapping it, you stuck it in one of those hallmark gift bags and stuffed pastel tissue paper ontop. 

As soon as your friend sees the present, they will be brought to tears by it.  The hallmark bag will be forgotten. And yes, you put tremendous thought into the gift and it shows.  

But why not give it a proper gift wrap?  Only takes a bit more effort and it befits what's inside.

OOH right off the bat it was getting me pumped.  For general song composition and catchyness, I think it's great.  

Parts sound over limited or compressed.  Like, for instance, starting at around 1 min, it sounds like the lead and the bass are fighting for the sound space or something.  Same thing happens at like 1:44.  That huge bass is sweet, but it's like making everything else sound quieter, you know?  

OOH, the part starting at ~1:59 is sexy.  There's like a lower arpeggio going on that sounds cool, but I can't hear it well enough.  I feel like that should be a bit more distinct as like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something.

Anyway, these are comments from someone that doesn't really like this genre, but the track kept me interested, which I think says a lot. 

Keep up the good work!

**Centipede Hz:**


* Moonjock - Avey
* Today's Supernatural - Avey
* Rosie Oh - Panda
* Applesauce - Avey
* Wide Eyed - Deakin (only full album lead vocal)
* Father Time - Avey

* Mercury Man - Avey (through a heavier chorus filter than normal, also pretty evident when he holds long notes in the studio version)
* Pulleys - Avey
* Amanita - Avey

**Fall Be Kind**

* Graze - Avey, then Panda, then Panda low harmony/Avey high harmony during pan flutes
* What Would I Want Sky? - Avey/Panda harmonies during intro, Avey lead when melody kicks in and Panda counter-melody
* Bleed - Avey low harmony/Panda high harmony (I've heard this referred to as the My Girls redux, but I don't personally agree with that)
* On A Highway - Avey lead, Avey low harmony/Panda high harmony during chorus
* I Think I Can - Panda

* My Girls - Panda (Avey harmonies)
* Also Frightened - Basically both of them
* Summertime Clothes - Avey (panda harmonies)
* Daily Routine - Panda
* Bluish - Avey
* Guys Eyes - Panda, Avey counter-melody
* Taste - Intro is Panda, Avey during verse with Panda counter-melody, Panda during prechorus, Avey low harmony/Panda high harmony during "Am I really all the things that are outside of me?"
* Lion In a Coma - Avey
* No More Runnin' - Avey, Avey low harmony/Panda high harmony during chorus
* Brothersport - Panda lead, Avey background vocals, Avey scream during middle, Panda low harmony/Avey high harmony during ending

**Water Curses**

* Water Curses - Avey doing both high and low harmony at all parts (never performed live)
* Street Flash - Avey
* Cobwebs - Avey
* Seal Eyeing - Avey

**Strawberry Jam**

* Peacebone - Avey
* Unsolved Mysteries - Avey
* Chores - Panda, Panda lead and Avey background vocals during second half
* For Reverend Green - Avey
* Fireworks - Avey
* #1 - Avey, with one of his most heavily modified vocal tracks, is the dark growling lead, Panda is the higher and intelligible voice
* Winter Wonder Land - Avey
* Cuckoo Cuckoo - Avey
* Derek - Panda

**People**

* People - Avey is the one doing the "yeah, yeah-eh"s and the yelling
* Tikwid - Avey, Panda background vocals
* My Favorite Colors - Another heavily modified Avey vocal

**Feels**

* Did You See The Words - Avey, Panda does background vocals
* Grass - Avey
* Flesh Canoe - Avey, with the exception of Panda's "oh, ohhhhh" at the end. Panda also doing the background "oo"s
* The Purple Bottle - Avey
* Bees - Avey
* Banshee Beat - Avey
* Daffy Duck - Avey
* Loch Raven - Panda singing "I will not give up on you" while Avey does his nearly inaudible lead
* Turn Into Something - Avey

I'd continue, but suffice it to say Sung Tongs has Panda on lead in Leaf House, and then on harmonies with Avey on Who Could Win a Rabbit?, Winters Love, and College. Any other appearances are for background vocals.

After that for Panda, it's sparse appearances in **Here Comes the Indian** (Screaming toward the beginning of Hey Light), **Hollindagin** (first portions of I See You Pan and Forest Gospel, the higher voice in Lablakely Dress), and **Danse Manatee** (Higher voice in Another White Singer, last minute-ish of Meet the Light Child, more heavily modded version of high voice in Lablakely Dress. Although, I really want to believe that's him yelling the intro bits before Avey sings in the middle of In The Singing Box [sounds like "Jacob!", first at 2:09, definitely can be heard at 3:12]). I think **Spirit They've Gone, Spirit They've Vanished** was strictly Avey on vocals, but please correct me if I'm wrong and I'll edit.

::edit::

Added that Panda does background vocals on a few more songs

Try looping your melody and then taking another instrument and noodling around on a keyboard or whistling the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to it, until you find something that fits.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2014-06-17 00:55:44 fyaopo<br>I would have varied the dynamics a little bit more, especially with the flute melody. I feel that dissonant note was a bit out of place though it did add some variety to the piece. I also would have varied the strings such that they would be playing a kind of moving counter-melody or bassline. There's nothing wrong with homophonic types of compositions but I feel this piece could have been made better with more than just one melody or one idea being expressed.

EDIT: Also, I would have made the overall mix much louder. This will especially be useful when you vary dynamics.

Look up one of your favorite songs in your DAW and grab a notebook and paper. Listen to what happens in the first 8 bars.

For example; 8 bars
-volume automated melody
-filter cutoff automation hi hats
-pads
-white noise sweep to next section

Then analyze the next 8 bars
-melody
-<b><u>counter melody</u></b>
-simple drum pattern
-pads
-bongo roll to next section

Etc etc. take your time with this and then use this as a template for starting out, I wouldn't recommend copying this layout all the time but it's a good starting point to learn from. Good luck.

To me it sounds like it needs a higher melody/<b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Possibly a high synth, though not overpowering, maybe with a bit of delay and reverb. Just something to sprinkle in a few notes here and there in the vocal breaks.

Unfortunately I think it is a problem for most bassists in Thrash bands mainly because of the style of the music as you suggested. A bassy tone often gets lost in the mix due to the powerful power chords of the guitarists so you are forced to turn up the treble for a 'clicky' tone just to be able to hear yourself even! Most of the time I could not persuade the guitarists to change their bass heavy scooped tone to give me room in the mix. So I either had to accept it or I had to elbow my way to audibility with a frankly enormous gnarly distorted tone! I did this by splitting my signal, sending one to a clean amp and the other through the fuzz box. This prevented the dynamics turning to mush as the clean signal preserved some clarity. 

Songwriting wise - They always say try to build your basslines out of other notes in the chord not just the root. Kinda hard when the chords they are playing are power chords of root,fifth and octave  ;) lol

You could always try playing a counter-melody to the guitarists, rather than doubling the riff, or perhaps taking melodic/rhythmic inspiration from the vocalist or drummer instead? 


</p></li><li><p><b>composertalk</b> 2014-06-21 10:09:56 michinoku<br>One of the best ways to make a song with a limited number of chords work really well is to harmonize it in different ways. What instrument are you writing the song on? If possible, try a few different inversions of the chords on a keyboard/piano just to try some ways of harmonizing the chords.
I also feel like there is a tradition in pop music of using strings to play a melody/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> tutti or in octaves while a more traditional rock instrument is used to cover the chord changes. Jeff Buckley's album Grace has some pretty incredible string arrangements that take advantage of that, especially Last Goodbye.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2014-06-24 22:11:23 markp117<br>To be honest, I hate the fact that the piano doubles the violin the entire time. At least introduce a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or harmony. It get's very stagnant and boring. You have a beautiful melody and a fantastic harmonies, but the right hand of the piano should be more than just a doubler. Give the piano the melody at points, and have the violinist rest. Vice versa.

I understand its a duet and not a solo, but the two instruments should work as a team and contain idiomatic writing. You don't write for piano to have it be a melody, but rather harmonies and filler. Just expand on what you have!!!!! Make the piano sound like a piano!!!! 
</p></li><li><p><b>gamemusic</b> 2014-06-24 23:16:50 YoCzechIt<br>Hey, thanks for sharing!

Overall, I like it, and I definitely agree that it would be right at home as the backing track for the sleepy fishing / farming hometown of an SNES RPG hero. I'd also say it could be used effectively as any grasslands- or meadow-themed level in, say, a puzzle-platformer or pure puzzle game for mobile.

Here are my notes:

**Likes**

I primarily liked how it immediately conveys the sense of being in a place that is completely unconcerned with the affairs of the surrounding world. It definitely hearkens to the nostalgic qualities of SNES-era RPG music. Specifically, though:

* I always enjoy offbeat time signatures, so the 7/4 you used here definitely appeals to me.    
* The simple melody, major key, and instrumentation work together effectively to convey a peaceful and cheerful tone.
* It doesn't feel like there are really any gaps in instrumentation that could be filled. It feels like just the right fullness of sound for a peaceful place.
* The percussion and the string accents provide nice rhythm to complement the more static melody.

**Dislikes**

Overall, it feels a bit repetitive and becomes almost grating after several repeats of the loop. I think I have pinpointed a few of the reasons it feels that way to me:

* The flute instrument you're using feels much too robotic. The sustains are too constant and too long, which gives the listener no breathing room between the notes in the melody.
* While the melody's simplicity is one of its strengths in conveying its tone, I feel it stays too static to be interesting. You end almost every musical phrase on A, except for the points at the end of each melodic concept where you end on an E. Combine that with the mechanically unflinching quality of that flute, and it feels like that note is being burned into my brain. If you switch up the ends of your phrases a bit more, I think it will feel less fatiguing on the ears.
* Though I do appreciate the attempt to harmonize the two separate melodies near the end, the execution kind of falls apart, for me. It might be exacerbated a bit by the flute you're using, but it often feels dissonant as the melodies dance around each other as they do. The exact same wind instrument robotically squawking two separate melodies -- which are frequently only 1 or 2 steps apart -- doesn't sound great, to me. You could try putting the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on a different instrument than flute to mitigate that effect a bit, or maybe write a flute harmony part specifically to complement the main melody in that section more appropriately.

TL;DR - Change that flute!
</p></li><li><p><b>videos</b> 2014-06-28 21:19:59 ballew57<br>Seriously! Now bass players just follow a chord chart and play that with no lead line or counter-melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriting</b> 2014-07-06 13:20:01 MusicallyIdle<br>* figure out the notes in your riff

* Figure out the key using those notes

* Play riff on repeat to figure out a vocal melody, or write a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> using your instrument of choice

* Add chords if you want to by looking at a note in the riff and finding the chord with that note
</p></li><li><p><b>Accordion</b> 2014-07-06 21:26:48 michinoku<br>There's always the old joke - 
"Q:how do you keep two accordionists in time? A: Shoot one of them"
but as with any instrument that CAN do rhythm among other things, an effective duet is just a matter of finding the right roles for each player, be it the right harmony, or a counter-melody in the left hand, etc. But if  both doing oom-pah (or oom-pah-pah) rhythms and primary melodic lines, you'd start to see quickly why the above joke came about (besides general meanness to accordions...)

As for extant duets I know of few (I see a handful of free-scores.com but can't vouch for them), but there is a whole body of accordion orchestra music from the 50s and before that could give you some idea of how to make the best use of multiple accordions.

Now, of course, if you meant duet as accordion with another instrument, this is extremely common. I've done a fair amount of playing with accordion/guitar, accordion/violin, accordion/clarinet or flute, and it works really nicely because then you can usually fake an arrangement off of a decent lead-sheet...

I read somewhere that they use a lot of Nexus... I think the muted plucks and some of the dirty square presets you can recognize for sure. 

My guess is one of the layers on the lead in Fix This is just a dirty square preset (with no added distortion), and some clever sidechaining to give those 16th notes some pump. 

Gotta love that little <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in half way through the drop
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2014-07-14 13:48:27 Jeffplz<br>Hey I like this a lot! Everything sounds very nice, and I love the drop! I think you just need a counter-melody and inbetweeners, like stabs, random fx, quick swishes or reverses, subtle things like that to keep it interesting. The wobble during 2:20 was very unexpected, don't think it fits in the track. You could replace it with classical strings, and maybe throw an lfo on it to keep the wobble sound. One last thing, you should have a sub bass that doesn't stop playing at any time during the drop, make it a bit quiet so your other bassline doesn't conflict with it. Otherwise, I love this.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2014-07-16 20:03:45 Mondonater<br>I love it. Kinda sounds like a funky mix of Anamanaguchi and some Beatmania stuff. I think it could potentially benefit from something like a counter-melody or some extra harmony or a little more of a "busy" feel in the low end (to get some more of that R&amp;B feel), but it sounds great in its own right already. I'm a fan.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2014-07-19 06:51:28 kp_centi<br>I was pretty much taught this in Band. When a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or a Ostinato pattern joins in. After a few loops, you quiet down because you aren't the main part haha.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2014-07-21 07:56:01 androidjohn98<br>Yo! Plucks in the beginning are nice, but the mix sounds like its been waaay overcompressed. Bass is heavy! Awesome. Some sound design could definitely use a bit of work (specifically the one that comes in as a sorta <b><u>counter melody</u></b>?). Sound design is pretty cool! I'm not sure how I feel about the high pitched bass though. I feel like it's thrown in there just because, and it's not really complimenting the track, but rather making it sound almost generic. I like the stabs you use in the build. Drums are good but they get lost in the mix due to the over compressed master. Overall I'd suggest you really start focusing on your mixing, talk to your producer friends (start getting involved in the community if you dont have any!) about how they mix their songs, and take tips from tutorials and other artists' songs. Other than that, nice work!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2014-07-22 02:38:34 SexualMilkChocolate<br>Not a professional by a long shot just thought i'd share a quick rundown of my process. 

Scenario 2:

I start with finding a sound that i like, whether it be a piano or synth or stings. Then i try to create a melody from there. Once the melody is done, I make a counter-melody. After that I add the various drums and percussions. Then lastly i usually add the bass in. Once it's sounding like how i want it, i normally tweak it and add in other sounds to make it sound bigger and more full. Then comes the mixing last before i bounce/track it out. 
</p></li><li><p><b>drumcorps</b> 2014-07-23 09:00:01 Shredder13<br>&gt;However its hard not to just double the most busy horn book in DCI. 

I disagree with you there. Probably more due to just personal experience, but I RARELY double melody in groups past high school level. And even when I do, I busy up the parts to include <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, harmony or other stuff. And octaves as harmony aren't necessary when you have five marimbas AND amplification. 
</p></li><li><p><b>drumcorps</b> 2014-07-23 09:30:25 Shredder13<br>But there are so many options! Counter-melody! Harmony! Counter-rhythms! Heck, even try out some instrument that isn't a keyboard! But I never feel like Crown explores those. Certainly never see hand drums or anything like that. 

I think Andrew Markworth is just used to the front being the entire melodic ensemble, so if the pit doesn't play melody, it's wrong. Which is sad because I'd like to see some more colors explored by the section up front, not the instruments scattered around the field. 
</p></li><li><p><b>Christianity</b> 2014-07-25 08:44:48 HeroOfAnotherStory<br>Um, no. This needs to be a full-blown HBOesque series. 

David is on the run and a shadow of his former self. He enters a holy place and asks for food and weapons. They only have one weapon, which is now a sacred relic: the sword of the legendary enemy of Israel, Goliath. Then you play the David theme music, which during this entire season has been completely absent, or played with augmented chord progressions in the relative minor, but now is playing in massive major crescendos. As the music reaches it's peak, the camera cuts to a close-up depth of focus shot of David's face, and the priest says, "We only have this sword, a sword won years ago by the mighty hero, David, defender of Israel." You remember who David is; maybe David starts to remember who David is; the title theme enters the score as a counter-melody, and the suddenly everything cuts to black and the credits roll for the season three finale. 

Too much for a film.
</p></li><li><p><b>concertina</b> 2014-07-26 20:55:21 EarthDayYeti<br>Actually the octave range is almost the same for all three types. Basically you're looking at three and a half octaves whichever way you go.

All concertinas are capable of playing multiple notes at once, is just a matter of what style you want to play. English are capable of harmonizing with a few chords, but no good for any sort of bass accompaniment. Duets, as their name implies, are designed to play a melody with a bass accompaniment. Anglos can do a bit of both, but are limited in this respect by their push/pull mechanic.

I'd actually consider the Anglo concertina the easiest to learn. Have you ever played harmonica? The concept is incredibly similar. [If you look at an Anglo button chart](http://www.buttonbox.com/images/Anglo-FC-CG.jpg) (there are two common variations shown here) you'll see three rows of buttons: a G row on the bottom, a C row in the middle, and a row with "extra" notes on top. Pushing on the C or G row will only give you the C or G major chord respectively. Pulling will give you the notes in between to fill out the C and G major scales (this is why we refer to the must common type of Anglo as C/G, though other keys are available). An astute observer will notice that this only let's you pay in the keys of C, G, and their parallel minor keys. That's where the third row comes in, providing chromatic notes to fill in other common scales. The major drawback of this style is that you're limited to a few different keys. Fortunately, most Irish music and many other types of folk dance music are conveniently (more or less) written exclusively in the same keys. As for the push and pull, many people say it creates a rhythmic effect that is prized in the folk and [Irish dance](http://youtu.be/w0AXTiTyl_Q) music Anglos are often used to play (most of the music you'll find posted in this subreddit), whereas I've heard complaints that English and Duets can be too legato or smooth to play that type of music well. 

[English concertinas](http://www.concertina.com/fingering/images/english48-W842H736.gif) have a layout that makes a little less sense to me (full disclosure: I'm biased towards Anglos). The middle two rows correspond to C major (think white keys on a piano) and the outer two rows are either a half-step above or below the adjacent middle row button (corresponding to the black keys on the piano). You'll notice that one obvious advantage over the Anglo system is that English concertinas are fully chromatic (they contain the pitches needed to play in ANY key, though whether or not it's any easier to play in keys other than C, G, and their closely related keys is another story). You'll also notice that, unlike the Anglo and duet, the English is not organized with the low notes on left hand side and the high notes on the right. Instead, the middle two rows are organized as two circles of fifths a third apart. This means that in order to play a scale, you alternate back and forth between your left and right hands. C on the left, D on the right, E back on the left, F back in the right, etc. It's worth noting that English concertinas usually come in "treble" and "baritone", roughly corresponding to female and male vocal ranges. These are great for folk songs and ballads, [vocal accompaniment](http://youtu.be/3zArPbBNeHU), and I've even heard some [classical music](http://youtu.be/D_YC_tgZYXg) played convincingly on them. 

Duets are traditionally the hardest to learn, though that may be because there are dozens of different button layouts. The Concertina Connection duets use the [Haydn layout](http://www.concertina.com/fingering/images/hayden-W1350H480.gif), which is supposedly the most modern and easiest to learn. The basic idea behind the duet concertina, as the name suggests, is to play two melodies at once, or at least have the two hands operate independently. The button layout is a little more straightforward than the English or Anglo, though it can be a lot of buttons to get your fingers around. Basically you have the "white keys" in the middle and the "black keys" on the periphery, as in the English, but here they're arranged in a more scalar fashion. It's worth noting that, unlike the Anglo and English, duet concertinas were often played with brass instruments (their use in Salvation Army bands is a huge part of their history), and are therefore much easier to play in more brass-friendly keys like F, B-flat, and E-flat. Duets are fairly versatile; you can play a [melody and accompaniment](http://youtu.be/5PDvPkV_-TM) style, a [melody and counter-melody](http://youtu.be/v9j8YTTT6wU), or even [hymns](http://youtu.be/dmwAuWrZeLs).

Hope that was helpful.
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2014-07-27 14:14:28 god_of_all_men<br>I'll add one opinion - focus on the chords.  Understand the chords, how they relate to each other, which chords lead where (ultimately, it's all ii-V in the end), and learn arpeggios for major, minor, and 7th chords, and then altered chords (dim and aug) but if your guitarist isn't using them, I wouldn't worry about these too much for now.  Practice the chord arpeggios until you dream about them.  They should be 2nd nature.

Then after you do all that, learn the major, minor and dominant (mixolydian) scales, and understand how they relate to the chords you learned.  Ultimately, scales are just the notes in between the chord tones, so they really don't matter all that much.

Then forget it all, and play what you hear.  The key is to open your ear thru study, then get out of the way and let the notes speak for themselves.  And don't focus too hard on scales; just play notes that sound good over the chords you have studied (that's why arpeggio study is important).  People obsess over scales too much.  IMO, the only time weird scales are cool is when you juxtapose some unusual mode over a standard progression.  But that's further down the line for you.

Philosophically, I treat the bass line as a counter-melody that runs parallel to the primary melody.  Sometimes I double the melody, other times I fill in around it.  But everything revolves around the melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2014-07-28 20:08:48 Rand0mPixels<br>I like the melody, though it could benefit perhaps from some more reverb and perhaps some delay. Also maybe a higher <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. The drop could fit much better if there was a simpler version of the melody going throughout it. Apart from that, a really nice track. Oh, and the piano sound isnt great, but that sounds like FL Keys so nothing much you can do there :P
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2014-07-31 13:45:59 benthicmastadon<br>Sit down with a slow, pretty melody by one of your favorite artists. Take some time to pick out by ear the different parts of the composition (bass, rhythm, melody, and counter-melody). Pay careful attention to intervals, patterns, and key changes in the song.

Eventually, you will develop the tools these artists use. Then you can use them to express your own thoughts and feeling from a more developed, artistic approach. Mindfulness and attention are essential in this process.

I would also suggest reading Arron Shearer's "Learning the Classical Guitar, parts 1 &amp; 2." If you are serious about improving your skills, this is a great place to start. It might help to have a teacher for a few months if you have questions or difficulties with technique.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2014-08-08 20:35:45 Wakez-<br>Umm sample pack wise I think I used the ol' vengeance club essentials. Nowa days I use a lot of different sample packs. Really suggest going on beatport and having a look through there drum stuff. Along with other things. 

Umm I personally love melodic stuff soo I tend to start with a nice chord progression. I use plucks or a piano vst for starters. Just easier on the ears for me. Then build on top of it. 
Add a synth or two. Add a melody. Change the melody often. Add a hook. For that track I added a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. 
Oh! Always when adding a new synth or what ever chuck it straight into an FX channel. May be kinda obvious to some but for others not so much. 
I EQ on the fly often as well. Getting rid of frequencies I don't need. Boosting others. 

After I have a nice melody going I add the sub and mid bass. Add a nice side chain. Chuck in my drum pattern and that's pretty much it for my drop. 

I personally really enjoy working around the drop to working around a build up. If you make the build up first the drop could sound off. Or you get peeved that it doesn't sound right with the build up. 

With intros and stuff. I just piggy pack from the drop, mainly using the same chord progression as the drop but without the melody. 

Everything else I do is just ear candy in a sense. I just add little things here and there to make it sound full. A vocal effect, wind Downs, rises,  impacts. 

Wow that's a lot a woords

</p></li><li><p><b>changemyview</b> 2014-08-14 23:26:33 ExtraSmooth<br>The Beatles didn't invent a whole lot. Nothing they did that was musically interesting was 100% original, except maybe combining Indian musical styles with Western popular music. However, the Beatles did reintroduce many ideas from classical music and art music into popular music, and did it in a way that was still accessible and popular. Take for instance the melodic guitar and bass playing on [And Your Bird Can Sing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC6D2N4nylg). The guitar has its own melody, independent of the vocals (rather than just playing chords, improvising, or following the vocal line), and during the chorus the guitar plays a [counter-melody](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-melody). If you listen to the [bass part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQjbvs2HDPU) of And Your Bird Can Sing, you'll find an entirely different part (rather than just following the guitar or playing the root, which was common of popular music of the time).
   
  The Beatles also wrote in 3/4 time, as in [Long, Long, Long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyHcRlNkDFk) and briefly in [We Can Work It Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfuTDbdKoY). 3/4 time is a very common time signature in classical music, but was (and still is) quite rare for popular music. [All You Need Is Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pFAFsTFTI) also contains some odd time signatures, not to mention an entire orchestra and choir is included on the song.
        
  Classical instrumental ensembles of various sizes are also included on [Penny Lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FlQCtg96SQ), [Strawberry Fields Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nehRB1FTeTo), and a few others. Writing for orchestras and large ensembles is a lot of work, and they were rarely used except as background for popular music. In other words, many artists of the time would use orchestras, but they would just write parts as if they were a 4 piece pop act, playing chords and basic rhythms. The Beatles actually wrote individual parts for each section of the orchestra with their own countermelodies, solis, and musical ideas.
    
As far as simple chord progressions, I would point you to [Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCiG7xoEb2Y), [She's Leaving Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lG3nXyI41M), Strawberry Fields Forever, [Honey Pie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTuOAPE-LOo), and [Your Mother Should Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xycaGZtusmo). All have very interesting chord progressions. Or you could look at [Tomorrow Never Knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spjcPS4ekOA) and [Blue Jay Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNLcXj5yR68), which are interesting in that they use very few chords. 
      

The Beatles also wrote instrumental and semi-instrumental pieces, such as [Flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yTY__PKLDQ) and [Sun King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgQ8fS3o28), which maintain interest without the traditional popular device of lyrics.

Bassline : Moog Sub Phatty -&gt; run through analog guitar phaser pedal 

Various bass timbres, like the bass in the breakdowns are also from the sub phatty 

The mellow warm bass in the intro and outro groove is from a fender bass vi (just sits well in the mix and fills in some low end) meshes well with the synths. 

The arps in the breakdowns are from the sub phatty and are run through a Earthquaker Devices disaster transport SR (great pedal). 

The intro pad is something I made in massive. 

Asides from that I used some of the originals track stems for : resonant <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and some layering / "glitches" within the bassline.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2014-08-22 04:38:00 TranscodedMusic<br>The best thing you can do is spend a lot of time listening to tracks that are similar to your track, then A/B them as references for your track. 

Generally, the heart of your song has to lie with the kick drum. You need to put yourself into a mindset where you are imagining people in a club dancing to your track. The kick is what's going to keep them on the beat, so it needs to cut through. This means sidechaining your lead and bass. 

Secondly, making sure the lead and the bass aren't competing has a lot to do with song construction. If the lead and the bass are playing separate melodies, try writing them in more of a call and response style. So your lead plays some notes at the beginning of the measure and your bass 'responds' with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. I try more and more to have very few things overlapping at any given moment. Even if there are complex melodies, your track is going to sound louder and cleaner if at any given moment elements are not playing simultaneous notes, or are at least sidechained (or gated) so they duck out for a millisecond to make room for the main element.

Another thing to keep in mind is what your goal is on the drop. Do you want a super heavy bass element? That's fine, but you better make sure your kick is short and punchy. Do you want a dominant synth lead? Also cool, but choose a kick with more boom to it.

Point here is that the success of your drop is 90% song construction and 10% mixing. Don't be afraid to use the tracks you like as a template; they work for a reason.

For example, many things that may sound "cheesy" to your average western ear are seen as perfectly acceptable, while simultaneously a lot of tropes that just seem typical and normal to the western ear are perceived as "ugly". I'm not talking about specific chord progressions or whatever, more like feelings within the music. So personally, I think you can't really boil it down to a couple simple tips like "use pentatonic and be jazzy" or whatever -- you have to get an intuitive understanding of what sort of elements are valued or avoided, and that leads you towards making many subtly different choices which end up resulting in something that feels "together", self-consistent and following its own set of rules, even though no hugely obvious differences may be apparent at first sight.

Some tips/personal opinions (not exhaustive by any means, and certainly plenty of examples break each of these suggestions, but as with all music theory, you have to know the "rules" before you can break them effectively):

Do:

* "Melancholic/nostalgic" feeling rather than all out cheery or sorrowful music. Some common devices include extended harmonies in the melodies (your Mr. Lawrence link is an excellent example, which by the way [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBctM3EwPno) is a video of the composer going through it with explanations, but no translation), but you have to know which ones to avoid (e.g. dominant 7ths are often substituted for something similar that sounds "prettier"), Satie and Debussy were *hugely* influential in this area, especially the massively popular [Gymnopedie No.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU).
* <b><u>Counter melody</u></b>. There's this thing called 合いの手(ainote), which I'm not sure how to translate, but basically you "reply" to the lead, filling their spaces, [clear (if over the top) example in this mash-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-_i0Ovf9hs). Even when not this clear, there is often something in the accompaniment filling an equivalent role.
* Traditional rhythms. Mostly derived from Taiko. A common example would be [quarter, quarter, eighth, quarter, quarter, quarter, eighth, half], but there are many others. The relative lack of syncopation is mostly influenced by this.
* Sus4: This is so common I had to mention it, although it only exploded in popularity relatively recently, so perhaps the sound isn't necessarily associated with "Japanese" just yet. Using sus4 either to give cadences more power or to smoothen modulations (especially to V/vi) is all the rage right now.
* Catchy melodies. Hardly something exclusive to Japan, but here is where all the pentatonic stuff comes in. Innovation at all costs is *way* less valued here, something cliched but perfected is strongly preferred over something innovative yet mediocre.
* Modulation. Especially at the chorus, but really everywhere. Most common may be 3 semitones up, often through bVI.
* Pretty/cute/easy and pleasant to listen to stuff.

Don't:

* Heavy, over the top syncopation. Moderate syncopation is actually very common, especially in the accompaniment, but also in the lead. [Here](http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm3582943) is an early 90s Japanese educational tv show covering syncopation for context, no subtitles but perhaps followable nonetheless.
* "Sharpening" chords (i.e. putting major chords where minor ones would usually go), unless softened by a sus4 (as mentioned earlier) or done on purpose to contrast with a "prettier" section (generally the chorus). It gives the music a harsh ring which is not very popular -- flattening is ubiquitous and appropriate.
* Angry stuff. Overly aggressive/abrasive vocals or instruments.
* Highly chromatic/irregular meters/excessively technical music.
* Lydian. Other modes are actually represented I'd say about the same as they are in the west, with perhaps Dorian (and Aeolian if you want to count it as a mode) *more* represented than over here (although mostly in video game music, but keep in mind that video game music is much more influential in Japan), and maybe Phrygian a bit less (but still common in metal-inspired video game music) -- but for whatever reason, Lydian is more or less non-existent. I suspect it's that "sharpened" feel I talked about earlier, but that's just my personal speculation.

Okay, getting way too wall-of-text-y so I'll stop here.

Counter-melody and traditional rhythms are two things that I find the most common among most Japanese pop music, even though some of the other stuff you mentioned is quite common. Those two elements are almost never missing. Plenty of Western artists have catchy melodies and some of the other stuff mentioned is really vague, but there is also a fair amount of modulation in Japanese music as well. 

The "Don't"s are a little harder to get behind since there's so many variables and exceptions to those, but this was a pretty good starting point for such a vast subject.

Musically, the song draws us in by evolution throughout the song. It starts with almost nothing, and quickly establishes itself with a both the lyrical and melodic theme. The lyrics are repeated, but from another perspective and with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, giving the ear plenty to focus on. The heartbeat rhythm establishes a predictable pattern for the listener, while the sporadic percussion gives interesting surprises for the listener. The percussive hits after each chorus serve as punctuation and exuberance, making the listener more excited and involved with each repetition. 

The overarching theme of the album and this song in particular is confronting aspects of life that could once be approached with indifference. The singer belts out how he really doesn't need much in this world, only the blood in his veins. But now, with his wife and child, he has to come to terms with the fact he really does need more in this life, and the money is in fact important. The hero has spent his life in a meager existence, but it's now time to accept the need of material items. Don't forget this album came out in 2009, when the country was suffering in one of the worst recessions it's faced for generations. This spoke to directly to the struggles that many were feeling.

Honestly, Animal Collective is not anywhere near one my favorite bands, but this song in particular served a distinct need that people needed at that time. It provided solidarity for those struggling financially, and it did so while being fun and providing reprieve from greater concerns, while still addressing their reality.

Arrangement wise this is pretty solid, I just wish there was a *bit* more variation in notes in the lead melody with that bass stab.

The vocals fit well, the drums are mixed in there well,  I just wish there was a bit more to the melody. At 3:05, you have that bit-crushed high sound playing with the stabs. That sound would be wonderful to create an upper octave counter-melody to the lead stabs!

That's all I can really say, I hope it was useful!

I definitely agree with the counterpoint thing. That was one of my biggest problems before I started taking lessons - having a pretty simple form with a melody, maybe a small counter-melody and some simple accompaniment. Just take a look at the different ways you can support a melody, read some fugues, etc. etc.

In a different step, though, just try writing some short pieces. Studying is great and all, but application is what we're going for. Just little phrases and such with simple melodies like you normally write. Then go through and see in how many styles you can write the same melody with. Maybe in one it's very legato and connected, with a "flowing river" type accompaniment, then in the next the melody takes a back seat to some sort of sharp and pointillist accented ensemble movement. Writing small variations always helped me brainstorm where to go next - plus it'll help with creating a comp that has a common thread.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-09-12 00:51:47 BRNZ42<br>Big band writing is unlike voice leading in that it is top-down. The most important line is the highest sounding note, and all of the other parts work down from there. Unlike in classical voice leading, where each part is supposed to be an interesting individual part, the goal in big band writing is to have every part blend together and sound like one giant voice. 

In classical voice leading, parallel motion, especially 5ths and 8ves is heavily discouraged. In big band writing, everything is parallel motion. The basic strategy is to come up with the top line for a part, and then to have all the horns in that section play a line with the exact same contour as the top line, only on different chord tones. The effect is that it fills out the sound by playing all of the chord tones, but because it is all parallel or oblique motion, the parts blend together and sound like one giant voice, with the highest sounding note dominating the mix. 

**So basically, writing for big band is about two things: coming up with the lines themselves. Writing the melodies and counter melodies that will make up the highest sounding voices. And then learning to harmonize the voices below the top notes.** 

----
**Writing the parts**

Coming up with the parts isn't all that tough. It can be a fun creative exercise. Just think of it like a duet, or a point/counterpoint. You have a melody assigned to one section (or to a singer or a soloist), and then you use the other horns to contrast that melody. It can be a conversation or an argument. Have fun with it. But there are a few stylistic things to be aware of:

**Hits** are short loud blasts of a just a few notes at a time. They are little interjections to the melody. They are typically syncopated, staccato, and played by the trumpets and trombones. 

**Pads** are longer notes that support the melody or soloist. They are quieter and more subdued than hits, and are usually provided by saxophones. They can be as simple as whole notes that outline the chord, or more rhythmically complex and repetitive, but usually not terribly complex.

**Counter Melodies** are also common. Usually at the ends of phrases, these little melodies are like a response to the main melody. You can think of it as a call/response, or as a standalone melody. 

Let's look for these stylistic things in the example you provided (sing sing sing):

* at 00:30 we hear the saxophone section playing the melody, while the brass provide hits.
* at 1:10 there is a clarinet solo, providing the melody. But in the background the horns are playing a repetitive pad (this is a little more rhythmically involved than typical pads, but it's an energetic song). At the ends of the phrases of his solos, the brass fill in with a little <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. 
* at 1:37 we have a 3-part build up. Though all 13-15 horns end up playing, there are really just 3 parts. First the trombones start with a driving line, then the trumpets add some long notes, and the saxophones provide an 8th note heavy counterpoint. This sort of section would be composed exactly like a trio from a march. It's almost fugue like. But again, we're just thinking about the top part of each section, and we will learn how to harmonize the voices below each part in a minute. 

And it just continues on like this: sometimes the saxophones have the melody and the brass provide hits. Sometiems the brass has a melody, and the saxophones provide pads or an 8th-note countermelody. Sometimes it's a 3-part thing and each section has its own line. But throughout it all, the composer, Louis Prima, was just writing individual lines 2 or 3 interacting, and then the arranger, Fletcher Henderson, harmonized those lines with some simple strategies that follow below. 

----
**Actually voicing the damn things.**

Okay, so you've written some parts, and you know what the top voice of each section is going to do, and now it's time to harmonize it to fill out the sound. This is probably more what your question was actually about. There are several voicing schemes, but they're all pretty easy. Let's say, over a C7 chord, you have the following line in the top voice:

    C Bb E

Here are some ways to harmonize that line:

**4-way closed**. This is for 4 voices (ie 4 trumpets), and is the simplest way to voice a chord. The strategy is this: treat every chord like a 7th chord, and have every voice play the next chord tone down from the one above it. So voice out in 4-way closed, that line would look like:

    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G

By starting at the top, and working your way down, you ensure that every voice ends up following the same contour as the top voice (in this case, small move down, then leap up). Every note ends up sounding like a fully-voiced dominant seventh chord, so the underlying C7 harmony is strong. It really is that simple. We don't worry about voice leading, or keeping the common tone, or avoiding parallel fifths. Everything is determined by the top voice. 

But 4-way closed has a couple of issues. One, it is very compact. If you want a bigger sound you want to spread your voices out a bit to cover more sonic range. And two, it makes it a little hard for the top line to stand out. Look at that first voicing. The top note is on a C, but right underneath it is a Bb, just a whole step away. It is nice to give the top line some breathing room, so that takes us to our next strategy:

**Drop-2**. Drop-2 is simple, and it comes from 4-way closed. All you do is take your 4-way closed voicing, and change one thing. You take the second note down from the top (the "2") and "drop" it down an octave. So in our example we take the notes of the 2nd voice (Bb G C), and make that the lowest sounding voice, leaving a little space for the top voice. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    
    Bb G  C

We've now spread our voices out a bit, so this provides a bigger sound, and we've given the top voice some breathing room. "drop-2" is the default big band voicing, and the most common one you will use and come across. It sounds great, and tends to fall into the ranges of brass sections really well. But there are more strategies. Oh so many more:

**Drop 2-4**. What if you want an even more open sound, with all of the voices spread out? Then you drop both the 2 and the 4. For this voicing, you take the 2nd line from the top, and the 4th line from the top (otherwise known as the bottom line) and drop them an octave. This can be a good way to move into the lower register of trombones or bari sax, giving a loud and big sound, while still having high notes on the top note of the voicing. Here's what it would look like on our same example:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    
    Bb G  C
    
    E  C  G

**Applying these ideas for 5 voices.** It is common to have 5 players playing a cohesive set of parst like this, especially in the saxophone section (the standard big band is 2 alto saxes, 2 tenor saxes, and 1 bari sax. 5 total). The simplest thing to do is to find a way to double the top line an octave lower. With 4-way closed, this puts the doubled-lead as the lowest voicing. This is neat, because the melody sandwiches all of the other parts. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    C  Bb E

This happens to work out well because it means that alto sax 1 and the bari sax are playing the exact same part, and octave apart. The bari sax is an octave lower than an alto, so it amounts to them reading the same music. Convenient and cool. 

For drop-2 the double lead fills the space left between the rest of the voices and where the dropped voice ends up. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C

We basically wind up with a block of 4 voices in 4-way closed, with a gap and then a melody on top of that. Cool. 

In Drop 2-4, the doubled lead ends up sandwiched in the middle of the sound: 

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    
    E  C  G

This is a huge sound. You have a solid block of 3 voices in the middle, and a lead voice with some breathing room on top and a bass voice with some breathing room on the bottom. It's very dramatic. I'm a fan.

</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2014-09-18 06:45:49 [deleted]<br>Three general "ways" to write songs come to my mind (I am sure there are more, but this is the way I think about it).

There's "harmonic composition", where you start with the harmonies (ie, chords) and then write a melody that fits those chords. This has the advantage of giving you a framework to write melodies. On the other hand, it's harder to come up with an awesome melody this way. Close to all blues music is written this way, and I bet a lot of rock is, too.

There's "melodic composition" where you write a melody and harmonise that. This generally requires a good ear and some music theory, because there are usually a large number of chords that work for any given melody. Most pop music is written this way.

Then there's "holistic composition" where you write both together. Guys who do this often can come up with counter-melodies. This is an advanced technique, and many of the truly great song writers (Rogers and Hammerstein, David Bowie, Andrew Lloyd Webber) do this, because they can hear the melodies and harmonies together in their heads. If you could do this, you would already know.

Many really good, but not quite genius, songwriters use melodic composition, because there are many ways to harmonise a melody, and there's well understood theory of harmony. If you know music theory, harmonising a song 100 different ways isn't that hard. 

If you are writing a riff, that is probably either an instrumental melody (sometimes that ends up being the same as the vocal melody). or an ostinato or rhythmic counter-melody. That's an easier place to write a good song from then starting with the chords and trying to fit something cool to it, since you already have both a rhythmic and harmonic structure. "Seven nation Army" by White Stripes was written this way.

So my advice is to try to write riffs. Starting there, you can get some chord changes for the riffs, and you may be able to write a nice vocal melody (a good singer can usually write  vocal melodies also, and that can save you time), then lyrics.

Also, don't be the guy who says "I wrote a song" and all you have are some chord changes. That's not a song, that's harmonies to a song that doesn't exist yet.

</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2014-09-20 02:55:53 StarkyA<br>That and non-musicians vastly underestimate the sheer difficulty in writing a simple yet catchy tune.

Anyone can use one of the famous pop chord progressions, but using it well in a song where all the elements work together so fluidly to create something more than the sum of it's simplistic parts takes something extra.

After all, any schmuck with a guitar and a basic understanding of chords could play an Oasis song (to use an example with a mocking video posted somewhere in this topic), but very few songwriters can combine all the elements (vocal melody and timing, string/piano accompaniment, guitar <b><u>counter melody</u></b> etc.) In such a way that creates a melodic whole greater than the sum of any individual component.

So yeah, I tend to be a bit harsh on the kind of person who can dismiss any real songwriter as shit, with no clarifying reason or argument - because 99.9% of the time they're ignorant fools.

Take lyrics that you misheard from one of those songs and start something from that. Sing a counter-melody along with a song and turn that into your main melody line.  
  
But my advice, more than anything, would be to draw inspiration from everything you can, not just music. Books/poetry, famous speeches, the way the trees are moving outside your window, the smells coming from your kitchen at the moment, fond memories of loved ones, not-so-fond memories of people who have hurt you, your personal philosophies, the list is virtually endless. Just be inspired by everything around you. That's how "originality' is truly born; taking a bunch of unoriginal things and mashing them together into something new.

So that could be why. To be fair there are definitely some meandering sections of CHZ that could have used some counter-melody/harmony IMO, and my favorite songs by AnCo have all that glorious call and response they are so perfect at.

You need to find some more "genuine" instruments I guess I should say and use those instead of babbys first fruit loops project presets.

Also the drop is incredibly short and poorly produced. Plus at 128bpm, it doesn't really feel like it should be a dubstep track. You need to find that one signature sound that just clicks with you. Get Massive. Play around with it.

The melody just sounds like something came up with in about 5 seconds, not really any chordal structure aside from treble piano, bass piano, and bassline. You gotta have a bit of background stuff going on - maybe a counter-melody - and fill that emptiness around the track.

There's your feedback. Sorry if it comes off as a little mean, but dems da tr00th

Here's a track that's a good example [X1stance - Convicted](https://soundcloud.com/encoder-logic/convicted-v36). Listen to the intro, first the bass comes in, then 2 synths come in with different melodies, and then a third synth comes in playing yet another melody. They are all in the same key, but rhythmically and melodically distinct from each other.

If I found a record I want to sample I will chop the sample, work on the arrangement, work on drums, add bassline, add additional instruments and then start mixing.

With original compositions I normally start with my main melody. I figure out what key I want to play in and the chord progression and then I decide what sound I'm going to use. After that my process varies almost always but a lot of the time I layer that sound, add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, lay drums, bass line, add accents and then mix.

I realize after you've worked on a track for this long and consider it complete, you won't want to change any compositional elements of the track but my suggestion for any future work would be to focus a bit more on the drop. At 1:30 Bass is sounding nice, fat and angular but <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on top sounds a bit flat for 2 reasons IMO - 1) melody is a little too simplistic 2) It needs more than one synth on the top.

The way that I listen to music is that I choose one symphony and listen to it almost exclusively, many times, over the course of weeks or months. I read whatever analysis I can find for it as well. The more I understand the structure, the more I enjoy a symphony. The way themes are repeated and morphed and related to each other, the rhythmic motifs, what the composer felt about it and what story it tells for me. Also there's so much to pick up on that you can't by listening just once to one recording; I could be listening to an hour long symphony for the 10th time and finally hear and appreciate the soft counter-melody in the french horns in some part. My favorites over the years have been Mahler 5th 6th and now recently 2nd, Beethoven 5th 7th 9th, Rachmaninoff 2nd, Tchaikovsky 4th. It means my taste in music is relatively narrow, but I get a lot of depth and meaning out of what I do listen to.

My one favorite moment in a piece of music is the build up around 6:30 and the climax at 7:30:

Does anyone know what it's called when the bass/percussion line increases in pace exponentially before the bass drop? It's fucking everywhere and rather than getting me hyped up like it's supposed to do it just makes me tired of the song for being so goddamn formulaic. Good music in my opinion, at least electronic music, should subvert expectation to at least some degree. Instead I can pretty much predict an entire song once I've heard all the instruments being used.

Stop me if you've heard this one before (and please excuse my terrible terminology. I listen to a lot of music, but don't have any formal knowledge on the subject):

1. beat/bassline starts the song, for 3 measures

1. main instrument kicks in. 3 measures

1. <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is added. 3 more measures

1. everything but the beat/bassline is muted, slight, linear increase in pitch while the beats double in pace every 2 seconds, have that happen 4-5 times until it's fast enough

1. bass drop. Which is actually just the beat louder and a synth added. repeated for 6 measures

1. a cooldown period (because the music is so great, don't wanna tire yourself out) without the beat, sometimes just the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, sometimes just the melody, 3 measures.

1. Most songs will (hopefully) end by closing with a slow drum-snare fazing out the melody. But it might push its luck and go for the bass drop again repeating steps 4-7 until the artist gets bored.
</p></li><li><p><b>videos</b> 2014-10-10 04:54:29 rexanimate7<br>I actually got into an argument with the producer my band was working on our record with last month about "the bass shouldn't be playing a melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>."  He was of the thought that the bass should do what it does in all of his music that he writes and plays, play on the kick drum, ghost the root note in the chords being played, and stay in the background.  I'm a musician.  I understand theory, I place the notes in my bass lines where they fit in the structure of the chords, I play on the 5th, the 3rd, wherever it works and adds the feeling we're going for.  This guy simply couldn't understand it.  

I cited Police songs, Rush songs, the Beatles... you name it.  Guy still didn't comprehend it, and felt like a bass line that moves a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the vocals during a verse was a huge no no.  Mind you he also thought that vocal harmonies shouldn't cross the progression either, again, in some cases see the Beatles.

In the end, bass is a beautiful instrument.  You're like a lead guitar player, while also being the thing that makes the rhythm section go the other half of the time, and you can stick out or lay back and it all has its time and place.  

What this guy is doing, just really isn't all that impressive though.  Want to see tapping minus a pedal doing it all for a bass player, google Jean Baudin.

Edit:  I wanted to add a link to Jean's website.  [jeanbaudin.com](http://www.jeanbaudin.com/)
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2014-10-11 23:39:50 Kemosaabi<br>I think it's entirely contextual. I use bright strings because I'm often asked to play very rhythmically active, and/or melodic bass parts. Especially if I'm playing against a piano or keyboard player, the bass can disappear and become indistinct against their left hand. My job is not to fade into the mix in those cases. It's to make my part audible, so I use bright strings to accomplish that. And it's not like my low end goes away. It's still there just as much as when I play on half rounds, like I use on my other bass, it's just that the high end is more pronounced. It sounds terrible when played by itself, but when it's in the context of the rest of the band, it sounds really nice and clear.

You say "that's what guitars and cymbals are for", but I would argue that there's no reason a bass player can't add to that. I can provide a rhythmic attack that means the drummer doesn't need to, so they're free to do something cool with the toms that they wouldn't have been able to do before. I can play more pronounced melodies so the guitar player can play a strumming pattern that really adds to the rhythm of the song. While the piano goes low, I can move into the mid range and play <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the vocals. If my strings are too dull, that stuff all falls kind of flat.

But, as I said, it's all contextual. If I get asked to play more actively, I use my bass with an 18V preamp and round wounds. If I get asked to play more chill, I use my bass with a passive switch and half rounds. There's nothing wrong with either one. It all depends on what you, and the people you're making music with, think sounds good.
</p></li><li><p><b>audioengineering</b> 2014-10-12 12:23:45 otherwiseyep<br>(continued)....

At this stage, I recommend you print/freeze the above mult/clones, if you are working in a DAW, or if you have enough tape-tracks to do so. This is largely for purposes of sanity and workflow. You could spend forever second-guessing decisions you made above. Close the door, and force yourself to re-open it if necessary. 

So, now you have three tracks of orchestra (maybe four):

1. The main orchestra stem
2. "Orch highs", the non-mud parts of the above
3. "Orch harmonics", the artificial, distortion-created harmonics of the "mud" instruments/freqs. 
4. (Optional) "Orch overdrive", the "orchestra as guitar" track. 

Now, as stated earlier, each and any of these tracks is likely to sound much worse in some places than in others, relative to the "core" band mix. First step is to delete/mute the parts where none of the above orchestra parts sounds good. Don't argue with me, just fucking do it. I already told you we were going to piss everyone off and ruin their work. 

We could spend a million years on a theory of music debate and discussion, but that's not our job. Our job as mix-engineer is to make a good-sounding record out of the tracks recorded by the "artist" who thought it would be a good idea to mix his six-string spank-paddle with ~100 classically-trained musicians, and to somehow try and salvage something of the effort put in by the poor orchestrator who tried to accompany Johnny Rockstar's barre-chord song with something respectable. It is our job to rob the orchestrator of his self-respect, if necessary, and to make Johnny Rockstar's crazy idea sound good. 

*N.B., I actually have a lot of respect and admiration for musicians. Especially who have the guts and gall to hire an orchestra, but we still have to remember that they are musicians, and it's important to keep the judgement-making ability of musicians in perspective.*

Anyway, onto working the orch into the "band mix":

So now we have these 3~4 tracks of orchestra, all sonically different, and we have deleted the places where the orchestra just isn't working at all. This is likely to leave us with some "holes" in the arrangement, places where the orchestra disappears, in a distracting way. In fact, it's quite possible that most of the song has no orchestra, at this point. 

So what do we do about those "holes", where the orchestra disappears abruptly? 

Are you an audio-engineer, or are you a mouse? I already told you that you were going to hate yourself for what you were going to do to these orchestral tracks. Maybe you didn't believe me. Now you will learn.

- Easy option #1: Copy and paste. Auto-tune if necessary (actually, Melodyne is probably better, but use what you got). Be brutal. Crossfade "good" orchestral chords/sounds, each retuned to correct pitch, if necessary. 

- Easy Option #2: Re-work the arrangement so that the orchestral stuff is only playing where it sounds good. Remember the first three rules of mixing. Just because it was recorded, doesn't mean it belongs in the mix, or has to play all the way through it. 

- Maybe the orchestra only sounds good behind the chorus, and maybe only really behind the first chorus. Copy and paste that to all the choruses, or only to the third chorus, or whatever. 

- Do the edits sound bad? Some flute starts playing a counter-melody that won't fit unless you do a hard cutoff? Well, it's time to put your big-boy audio engineering pants on. I'm not going to tell you how to use short cross-faded loops or reverb or whatever to smooth over awkward edits. Look it up, if you don't know. 

Note that all the above is not necessarily how to make a final mix, just guidelines on dealing with an impossibly-dense track. The whole idea is to kick everyone out of the control room, and spend a day roughing out a mix that you can work with, as above. 

If you absolutely kill it on the rough mix, the band may be in love with your magic. But more likely, someone will ask why you re-arranged the song, why the orchestra isn't playing all the way through, etc, etc. 

When this happens, what you do it to mute all your hacked and mutilated orch stems, and instead play them the main band mix with the original orchestral stem. If you have done your job right, they will prefer your remix 100 times out of 100. 

Now, there may still be some discussion and feedback. In fact, there almost certainly will be. Maybe they want this or that deleted part included somewhere, or whatever. This is no problem, it's your job. The client is the boss. 

But now you have a frame of reference. You have done the work of getting their source-tracks to sound good together in a rough mix, and it's now the client's call, which aspects are musically and artistically  important. 

The mix engineer is primarily responsible for sonics and audio clarity. But it's up to the artist/producer to set the artistic and aesthetic priority. This is the stage where you bring them into the control-room, show them what you have done technically, and start the back-and-forth process of trying to make everyone happy. 

It may well be that the artist or producer wants more of the orchestral track, even if it's muddy. Or they may ask you to try a re-mix where you give more deference to the orchestra instead of the band, where there are sonic conflicts. E.g., maybe instead of a low-cut on the cellos, you mute the guitars to clean up mud, or some such. 

If the band/producer requests a remix with more focus on the orchestra, you can apply some of the above techniques to the "core" tracks, treating them as accompaniment to the orchestral stuff, up to and including cutting/pasting/re-tuning/muting based on parts that work best with the orchestral bed. 

Last but not least, some general concepts to keep in mind when engineering dense/complex mixes:

- Some instruments/sources are better at "punch" or dynamics 

- Other instruments/sources are better at rich, sustained sonic textures

- Other sources are good at melodic/musical clarity and focus

A trap that is easy to fall into, is trying to get any one track perfected in all three areas. Vocals and distorted guitars are the most common thing where audio engineers are put to a decision, in terms of what to focus on. Orchestras are ideally pre-mixed to do all three, in performance. 

Everything doing everything is a recipe for muddy, veiled, and vague recordings. A basic rule of mixing is similar to housekeeping: a place for everything, and everything in its place. You can't have huge guitars and huge vocals and huge orchestral accompaniment all at once. If something is big, then something else has to be smaller. Good sound comes from a division of roles. 

Have fun with it.

Guy had already been credited on several metal albums (he's done 2 for Maryln Manson alone) before he was 20.  He'd been working in studios since his late teens and as such was able to soak up tons of information regarding the ins and outs of mixing down records.  Couple that with hosting a radio show (i.e learning what worked in tracks getting airplay, and what didn't), so he knew from the get go what his tracks needed to sound like to be successful.  If there's ONE shortcut to making it big in music, that's it: knowing what works in a track, and what works in a mix (and how to execute both properly).  It also doesn't hurt that one of his good friends, Steve Duda, was/is an extremely seasoned and experienced studio hand as well.

**Also, remember that most of his tracks are extremely simple and sparse.  If you only have a few elements, it's easier to have a great mix.**  Go listen, for example, to "Not Exactly" - there's a kick, a snare/clap, hats, a few random sweeps and a bass that in the biggest parts of the track becomes a chord instrument.  That's it at most 10 tracks.  The arrangement is stupidly predictable and follows the standard arrangement of practically any mainstream house track out there.  

That's all you need - a catchy riff, some drums, a sweep or two, 2-3 FX, and maybe something musical such as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something to compliment your riff, and you're done.  **The more space you leave, the easier it is to mix your track.**

I think it sounds good and could feel it on some games but can see what you mean when you say there's something missing. I would try adding a background <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, either an answer to the main melody or an arpeggio kind of thing, at the moment all I can really here is melody, chords and drums. A strong bassline could really help here in terms of <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

In terms of production a little reverb goes a long way and you've probably got too much going on in the upper-mid range but then again I like my music quite bassy so it's personal preference but the mix sounds good. (listen to the super mario music bassline)

I like the melody and developments though! This would sound fine in a video game and I'm pretty sure 95% of the public wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and that of a professional.

HA^HA^HA^HA^What?!

If you can't make this beat with Nexus, then I strongly urge you watch tutorials on how to make a "West Coast" beat.  Watch alot of them.  If you still are having trouble making a beat that sounds like this, then you need ALOT more practice.

* Start by finding the BPM of this Hopsin track (guessing 92?)
* Grab a lead synth
* Record his pattern
* Grab a horn/organ
* Copy your previous pattern
* Add a dash of reverb to the horn/organ
* Now grab a bass
* Record a similar pattern
* You may even want to grab a piano for a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to add for your chorus
* Now add your drums
* Adjust your swing to about 12%

Now take what you have, and adjust accordingly.  I wrote this up without actually listening to his track for a second time, so I could be way off, but from my first listen, this is where I would begin.  Try YouTube "Making a basic west coast beat" and you'll be on your way.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-10-25 14:09:27 Salemosophy<br>It's situational, obviously, but in a huge contrapuntal setting I usually begin with the melody, then bass line, then inner voices. Here are the things I think about as I go about it:

* What is the general contour of my melodic line? I look for steps, skips, leaps, and direction upward or downward.
* How can I make the bass line independent? In relation to the melody, I try to move my bass line in opposing motion to the melody, both in direction AND in steps/skips/leaps. This way, my bass line moves independently from the melody.
* What does the melody/bass line combination imply harmonically? Here is where I consider possible progressions and just store those possibilities to utilize later in the process. This is also where I initially consider function and make adjustments to the bass line where needed.
* From here, it's a matter of filling in my inner voices. Since we have a directional line from our melody and another from our bass voice, the question becomes whether or not to move in reference to the melody or in reference to the bass. This is a purely aesthetic decision.
* Once an initial 4-part harmony is established, I go analyze for accuracy of harmonic function. Does the harmony move in a logical pattern of function of TS, TD, or TSD (where T=Tonic, S=Subdominant, and D=Dominant)? Of course, I reduce every chord down to its function (in major - I, vi, &amp; iii = Tonic; IV, ii = Subdominant; and V, vii^o = Dominant). For me, it's strictly a mental process, but if this is new, it helps to note it in your analysis. For borrowed chords (like bVI or II), I simply stick to their corresponding function in the key from which I borrowed them (so bVI would be a Tonic substitution while II would be a Subdominant Substitution). 
* From here, I tweak the voices and look for opportunities to make inner voices more fluid (or maybe even more connected to the material - like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or an imitation of another voice). If the melody moves by perfect 5th, maybe I can imitate that in the alto voice later, or maybe the bass line descends by a few steps and I can counter-act this motion with the tenor ascending by a few steps. Aesthetic decisions.
* Once I've reached this point, I have a pretty strong idea of what the passage wants to be. I've given each voice enough consideration to warrant its inclusion in the texture of the passage. It either supports what I'm doing by adding harmonic context, compliments another line with contrapuntal motion, or imitates what other voices are doing.

Here are a few simple tips:

* Learn and absorb the harmonic series for clearer results in voicing. Think of this like a "grid" upon which to assign pitches rather than guessing which voice should have which pitch of a chord. Think linearly as well about how a movement up or down could model the series. 
* If you're working with a large ensemble (especially band and orchestra), understand that you can assign harmonic fabric to a particular family of instruments and free up other instruments to compliment the fabric in other ways (gestures, unison or octave doubling of melody, driving rhythms, etc).
* Especially between Bass and Tenor voicings, one trick I've discovered is to alternate between octave and perfect fifth intervals, often resulting in a contrapuntal texture between the two voices. This saves me a lot of time in creating contrary lines because I'm already caring for the root or root &amp; fifth of the resulting harmony.
* Use chord inversions to smooth out your bass line. One example might be a bass line that moves up diatonically by step. In a I-V-I situation in C Major, for example, this might mean a C Maj, G7/D, C Maj/E or I, V4/3, I6. 
* Consider how some bass line intervals might tend to progress or regress the harmonic motion of the passage. Descending 2nds, 3rds, and 5ths along with ascending 2nds, 4ths, and 6ths might tend to progress harmonic motion while the compliment to that (descending 4ths and 6ths as well as ascending 3rds and 5ths) might tend to regress harmonic motion. As you're fleshing out your passage, start thinking about how interval motion in the bass affects your harmonic progression. 
* It's perfectly fine to move harmonically from root to root, so don't try to make it overly complicated with inverted chords right away. See what happens when you flesh out the passage with clearly voiced, root position chords first, and then find areas where it doesn't work and consider revising to an inverted chord for clearer movement of voices. 
* If the melody has the root, consider an inversion so the bass voice isn't producing the same pitch. Otherwise, try to keep the melodic line playing the structural 3rds, 5ths, or especially the color tones (basically, any chord extension of 7th or above) of any chord. This gives the melody prominence within the texture. You can work this out early by avoiding octave doubling between melody and bass lines. 
* Don't dwell on harmonic analysis until you absolutely need to. So what if you have an E in your melody and a Bb in your bass? The time to think about anything like that is much further along in the process. Focus on listening to your voices and what they "want" to be doing. You can work out the harmonic analysis later, or not at all for that matter. As long as it works, go with it. If anything, let the theorists slave away on analyzing it to death long after you're dead... or something. Sorry, that got really morbid there for a second.

Analyze works you like and see how composers voice their harmonic textures. Pick up scores/sheet music of songs and study them. Rewrite them, verbatim if you need to, and see what the voices are doing as you write them out. Are they moving in a particular way that's consistent with your ideal genre of music? Also, try to find tunes that make you think, "Man, this would be so much better if they'd done [this thing] instead," and try to implement that thing. 

Move voices around. Study how this affects the harmonic progression. Tweak things you've already heard to make them sound more like you. I guarantee this is how many of the most renowned composers learned their craft. It didn't really begin with theory for them. It began much later. Analyze for things OTHER THAN harmony. Come up with your own system of analysis for things like motifs, melodic contour, contrary motion, and so on. According to Jan La Rue, there are 5 elements of music - Sound (Timbres), Harmony, Melody, Rhythm, and Growth (Form). Try making "down and dirty" analyses of your favorite tunes by listening for these elements. See what happens from one passage of music to the next. What gets added? What gets taken away? How do these elements create impact? 

Anyway, this is my process. Give it a shot and tweak it to your style.

It seems to me that every note and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is meticulously planned to occupy the right space in the mix. Moreso than a lot of bands. 

My question is, how do you go about imagining the soundscape whilst writing a track? Or do the parts get written and the tones/effects/space all get decided during production, regardless of what's been written? 

Thank you for the AMA guys, very excited for Descensus.

</p></li><li><p><b>synthesizers</b> 2014-11-02 12:39:07 jp650<br>nice ambients soundscape. I think the keys are underrated for their bass capabilities. To me they have always sounded pretty fat. What throws me off a bit is the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the intro, kind of happy sounding for the dark vibe of the bass notes. Good work for a one synth track! I find it can be a fun exploration to make a track in that way, just for fun though. That snare sounds decent for coming from the keys especially 
</p></li><li><p><b>LetsTalkMusic</b> 2014-11-03 08:31:29 MLein97<br>&gt;That said, I've never been very good with lyrics. I can pick out or play all of the subtle instrumental nuances, yet I don't know many of the words to some of my favourite songs. I'm not quite sure why that is. 

Let me guess you play an instrument or at least are involved with something on the creation side of things like production?

I do the same and it's normally because I'm trying to figure out how I can replicate it by picking out everything that makes the song the song and figuring what idea is making me like the song. As a result when I sing a song in my head I normally will pay more attention to the overall "feel"  and how the melodies work with the rhythms and everything instead of just the words because for many songs they don't really do anything for the song other than just singing a melody. 
 
I also will occasionally try and make my own bit for a song that works with the current song (similar to <b><u>counter melody</u></b> bass line usually) I like instead of actually playing or singing the current song by the original arrangement. 
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2014-11-04 12:42:19 mokedawg<br>Pretty dope song, sounds pretty well mixed. I think if you added a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> somewhere in the middle it could take it to the next level. Keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2014-11-05 02:20:27 asphyxiate<br>Couple of tips for chord voicings (and composition):  
* Thirds and sixths are awesome and sound great when moving in parallel    
* Small intervals do not belong in the bass registers. I only use octaves and fifths when I get low.  
* When transitioning chords, try to use the same number of voices, otherwise it may sound weird (gets suddenly softer / louder from chord to chord)  
* Don't be afraid to have a fuckton of voices, but use your MIDI velocity to make sure to let the ones you want to come through do come through.  
* If you've sung in a choir before or are familiar with that kind of music, try composing in a 4-part harmony style: bass, tenor, alto, soprano.  If you're not familiar with the style, think of each voice as a different person and think about its role in the composition.  Lead? Harmony?  Supporting the lead?  Counter-melody?  Supporting the rhythm?
  
Edit:  
* Another important one, you don't have to play all the notes of the chord all the time!  Sometimes your melody + progression will just suggest certain chords, and often your progression will sound better with certain notes removed.
</p></li><li><p><b>songwriterscircle</b> 2014-11-05 21:40:11 summerlungs<br>Sounds like a less-hoarse mark lanegan fronting RHCP circa blood sugar sex magic.  I say mark lanegan because the verse reminds me of the kind of melody he favors.  These are compliments, dammit!

I know this isn't a final mix, but if it was, I'd say the acoustic winds up arm-wrestling with the vocal.  Which is bad;  the most intriguing aspect of this song is the vocal.  The harmonies, especially on the second chorus, are lovely.  

I'm not sure I would say this has two choruses.  I think what you're referring to as the first chorus is more of a second verse.  It doesn't deviate enough from the first verse to be a proper chorus.  I only say this because I think you'll find yourself in songwriting quicksand if you think of it as a chorus.  As I hear it the structure is A A B A (kinda) C 

Here's what I would do:

After the B (time spent alone),  cut out the return of the opening chords and go right to the start of the build at 1:19 with the drums.  Then the chorus suddenly becomes well epic-er.

I don't think the stuff after the chorus works.  Or rather, I think something could work better than what you've got.  I myself would repeat the chor progression of the chorus but without the vocals, and have a lead guitar play some kinda counter-melody to the sung chorus vocal.  Then you could pull a Neil young and go into a very very long solo from here, or just a short kinda solo.  I think of guitar solos as the Greek chorus of rock n roll:  they should provide another perspective on the song, a kind of commentary.  

After the guitar bit, I'd repeat the chorus, but drop everything out once you sing "along" and sing the "before you're gone" a Capella.  And boom, end of song.  

Very compelling stuff here.

&gt;

&gt;A __chord chart__ (or __chart__) is a form of [musical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation) that describes [harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony) and [rhythmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythmic) information. It is the most common form of notation used by professional [session musicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician) playing [jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz) or [popular music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music). It is intended primarily for a [rhythm section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_section) (usually consisting of [piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano), [guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar), [drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit) and [bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar)). In these genres the musicians are expected to be able to [improvise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_improvisation) the actual notes used to represent the [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music\)) and the appropriate [ornamentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornament_(music\)) or [<b><u>counter melody</u></b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_melody).

&gt;The harmony is given as a series of [chord symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_symbol) above a traditional [musical staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_staff). The rhythmic information can be very specific and written using a form of traditional notation, sometimes called __rhythmic notation__, or it can be completely unspecified using __slash notation__, allowing the musician to fill the bar any way he sees fit (called "[comping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comping)"). In __Nashville notation__ the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music\)) is left unspecified by substituting numbers for chord names.

</p></li><li><p><b>community</b> 2014-11-14 03:17:25 [deleted]<br>&gt; How about you actually look it up? It seems you're clinging to your own literal definition of it and have your head so far up your own ass you can't see anything else.

How about you point out a definition of melody that supports your claim, and explain how it does, and we'll go from there.  For now I'll point out that I know what a melody is, due to three decades of musical training.  Telling me to look up the definition of melody is like telling a computer programmer at the top of his field to look up the definition of a variable.

&gt; Vocals are what makes up a melody? And nothing besides them can be considered one? I don't even know what to say to that.

In a song like this that has a vocal melody, then yes, 99.9% of the time, the lead vocal is the melody.  You can have a counter-melody played by an instrument, but if you play a hundred pop/folk/rock songs (ie. songs like this with a vocal melody) to a hundred musicians, all of those musicians will identify the lead vocal as the melody in all of those songs. I guarantee it.

&gt; You said the FEEL, is what was similar. And then implied it was because every reggae song was structured that way, completely missing my point.

What I said is this: "the feel of the song, ***chords***, etc. are all the same."  What that means in this arrangement is that the percussion, the guitar rhythm, the guitar chords, AND the bass parts are the same.  The bass is part of the chord.  It's the bottom of the chord.

And yes, most reggae songs use those same three chords, and they use that same syncopated guitar rhythm, and a lot of the percussion tracks sounds like that too.  What's particularly unique to these two songs is the bassline.  You got that one part right.  But the bassline in this song is NOT the melody.  [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEC8nqT6Rrk) an example of a song where the bassline takes the melody.  

&gt; Compare the two songs and the basslines used in them at the parts I linked rather than getting your jimmies rustled over the definition of melody.

Uh yeah, I did.  Not sure why you'd even bother writing this sentence, since calling a supporting bassline "the melody" is what got my jimmies rustled in the first place.

EDIT: Hey, guess what? I listened again to both songs, and in the specific spots that you linked the melody is actually very similar as well.  So, you're correct right at that spot.  But that's just one line right at the end of Britta's a B, and that's actually the only spot where the Marley bassline occurs as well.  So when you say "they basically jacked the melody," a more accurate description would be "the ending of this song is an homage to Bob Marley's Stir It Up," rather than making it sound like they just ripped him off and put minimal effort into the song.
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2014-11-14 04:01:06 MLein97<br>The thing about learning new styles is that you should also learn how to use them right, and this style is fantastic because it opens up a lot of new territory if you learn it right.

For example he doesn't understand what drone is (see Tanpura) or doesn't focus on it as much, it's very important in Indian music, because it works as a really solid foundation so that you can get away with almost anything and it'll still sound good and full. Like you can play your soul into your instrument with more focus on color than actual notes and as long something touches the drone note in some way every so often it'll work (fifths, roots, octave, whatever) if it's a constant one.  

The Blues also works the same of way at times, as long as that drone is there you can do what ever you want to and it'll be the blues as long as you pay attention to your rhythm as well (like your drone is being sent through a tremolo now). They normally do this by droning 1 string, switching the drone with the chord (you can do this look into harmonium playing), or they'll make it really repetitive. In terms of the blues these concepts are derived from Banjo playing which has a drone string. 

So now you're wondering how you use these with the guitar and nothing else, either an Open tuning if you're going blues or Dadgad if you're going sitar. If you want both at the same time look into John Fahey or American Primitism.

The idea also show up elsewhere as well like in John Cale era Velvet Underground songs (which is coming off of using electronic hum like fridge hum as your drone and emulating it with a Viola, Bass, or piano).

Then if you're really pro you take the bit you wrote with the drone and you write a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or structure that makes it work without the drone.
</p></li><li><p><b>gamemusic</b> 2014-11-17 07:03:03 streichorchester<br>Very nice. As an arranger myself I have a few suggestions for the score:

1. Add some slurs for the horn part for phrasing. You can also put them in the piano part, but it takes a bit of work to make it look clean.

2. Big chords in the piano such as in measure 10 need a "rolled chord" articulation. This way you can add more notes to the chord.

3. Beginning in m. 11 the piano's bass part should be playing octaves, sometimes with added 5ths. This is just how most pianists would play this type of music given its chordal nature.

4. The final arpeggiation in the piano in m. 19 should not come back down, but just reach its way to the top note, maybe even going to the higher C.

5. If you continue with the B part of the theme it would be neat to switch it up so the piano plays the theme and the horn does some counter-melody, thus making it a true duet.
</p></li><li><p><b>pokemon</b> 2014-11-20 22:22:28 Noaxzl<br>The legendary themes for Groudon/Kyogre were always my least favorite. I know they were supposed to sound epic, but the percussion was super reptitive and the melody barely had any support. These versions sound *much* better. The percussion is actually interesting and the melody has a nice counter-melody underneath to balance it out.

In short, Game Freak made this track sound good! :D
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-11-29 08:03:07 las5h4<br>I was just listening to this song, [I Want To Be Well by Sufjan Stevens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO17WyaU2mE) earlier today.  Now I've listened to this song a million times because I'm a huge Sufjan fan, so there's several things about this song that I've noticed and find fascinating and which pertain to this discussion. So the whole climax of the song is built off of a descending D-flat Major scale.  The first time we hear it at 0:26, it's veiled in some pretty complex harmonies and it isn't repeated, not to mention it's tonally out-of context (the song has been in A-flat Major-ish so far).  We hear it in this context again at 0:58.  At 1:44, we have our modulation into D-flat Major, but there's still borrowed chords and modal extensions all over the place.  At 2:27, he says "remember that descending  D-flat Major scale from earlier that made no sense?" and at 2:34 he says "Let me strip that down for you and repeat it a thousand times."  At 3:16, he finally brings in a counter-melody, but the entire time in the background he is layering more and more background vocals which are just repetitive diatonic scales.  So we're growing in intensity, and by 3:58 we pretty much have a round of diatonic descending D-flat Major scales, but it's still interesting because it's all being framed by this harmonic progression.  But hey, look at the harmonic progression - the bass goes G-flat, F, E-flat, D-flat, B-flat, A-flat.  If you start the rotation with B-flat, you have the last six notes of a descending D-flat Major scale.  So that scale is pretty much the  only thing going on, and this all repeats and intensifies until this end of the song, and it's pretty sweet.

Sufjan probably stole this device from [Arvo Pärt's Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-xbhfNR2g) [(wiki page)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantus_in_Memoriam_Benjamin_Britten) which is just a desending A Minor scale repeated at various speeds.  It comes across as a very dynamic piece though.

The synth lines in [this Animal Collective song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogm80UNfKr8) wouldn't be that interesting if they weren't doing such weird polyrhythms, but AnCo makes it interesting.  That's the thing about scales, they really can easily sound lazy or boring, but it's about the context you put it in.  John Coltrane used scales to death, but it still sounds insane and amazing.  I'm sure Philip Glass, Steve Reich, John Adams all have examples sort of like these, but whether it's minimalism or bebop or indie rock, there has to be some ingenuity to make it work, in my opinion.

That's just the style they chose this time, right? It's much more complex than anything they've ever done, both in terms of sampling and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and other stuff. Geo really pulled no punches when it came to making a sample for every split second of the song that also reflects the mood and atmosphere of the music itself. Listening to it is like gorging yourself on candy. I can't get enough of it. So far I haven't heard any criticism of Hz that is accurate, in my mind. But I've heard a LOT of criticism.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-12-09 22:48:00 Indosay<br>Not sure of any resources, but I think the best thing to do would be to listen to some bands or songs that you like and see what they do.  Learn what chords they're using and how they get from verse to chorus, etc.  

Another point on actually working out other parts is something I picked up from some metal guitar player.  Can't remember who, but it was some video I watched years ago.  He was discussing how he writes riffs and says that he'll just start playing something, some random riff.  He may hate almost all of it after a few play throughs, but if there's one part he likes, he'll keep that part and discard the rest and try to write another riff centered around the original part that he liked.  If he finds some more parts that he likes, he'll add those and discard the new sections he doesn't like and write a 3rd riff doing the same thing.  He just follows this pattern, keeping bits that he really likes and discarding bits he doesn't, until he has a cohesive riff that he really likes.  I do the same when writing chords a lot of the time.  Write a verse progression and maybe I'll end up liking 2 of the 4 or 6 chords and keep those two and try to find new chords to fill in.  Or maybe it just needs different voiceings for some of the chords, or a different octave or whatever.  But even if you only find one chord you really like the first time around, keep that chord and try to find a 2nd, then a 3rd, etc.  Or heck, maybe your verse just needs two chords, or even one with a fun melody / <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  

Hope that makes sense and isn't too rambly.  
</p></li><li><p><b>LetsTalkMusic</b> 2014-12-11 13:56:42 MLein97<br>I don't mind them when the person actually knows what makes the original song work. For example if you have song that built around a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> intertwined with the melody you should have both if you're going to use the original melody because otherwise you lose half the song musically and it falls apart. This being an issue when someone tries to strip down a track too much, which is occasionally an issue, especially with the ones that will do a song because it is popular and they kind of like it, instead of when they love it.

Rehearsed heavily during the Twickenham Get Back sessions and performed during the *"rooftop concert"*, the song marks the last distinct Lennon/McCartney collaboration.  Paul McCartney wrote the verses and bridge for his new girlfriend, Linda Eastman, and John Lennon the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> (*"Everybody had a hard year"*) which was originally a song by itself.  The main guitar line from John's song came from a January 14th, 1969 demo entitled *"Watching Rainbows."*

I really doubt there is a title. It could be a "soundalike" as realnoyb has suggested, or they pulled this from a sound/music library. Pizzicato strings are a distinctive sound. Try playing them both at the same time in different windows. Kinda sounds fine.

Also, you've asked someone who makes a living as a violinist, so at the risk of going too in depth...this is what my ear can hear.

**Sims Shopping Theme:**

* Tempo/time signature: fast 4
* Primary key: C
* Harmony: jazz-y ostinato staccato bowed strings rhythmic pattern, with plucked even eighth notes moving down and up chromatic-ish scales/arpeggios
* Melody: longer, legato, slurred-- sort of "soaring" over, played by either winds or strings. Also, modulation.
* Orchestration: bowed upper strings &amp; pizzicato (plucked) strings, harp, flute, clarinet, possibly bassoon towards the end.

**Purina Ad:**

* Tempo/time signature: moderately fast 4
* Primary key: C
* Harmony: mostly just a syncopated drum beat ("off beats"). Everything else is either melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.
* Melody: Jazzy, staccato plucked eighth notes moving up and down in a scalewise/arpeggio-ey sort of way, chromatically around the key of C, modulates / visits other key areas.
* Orchestration: pizzicato violins, either glockenspiel or metallophone, (some kind of percussion), flute
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2014-12-18 13:07:45 Creedelback<br>Anything but arpeggios. So much new agey, emo piano music all sounds the same because the bass is just a series of arpeggios.

Since these are your first compositions, maybe stick with 2 voices. Try coming up with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that complements the right hand melody. Or a single bass line that hits the roots and inversions of the suggested harmonies.

You could also take a page from Chopin's waltzes and play a bass note followed by the rest of the chord.

Anything but arpeggios.
</p></li><li><p><b>gamemusic</b> 2014-12-23 23:28:05 YoCzechIt<br>Phantasy Star III did a similar thing with its world map theme. The number of characters you had in your party at any given time would affect the fullness of the instrumentation.

[One Party Member](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwxKHST_I68&amp;t=14m43s) only happens at the beginning of the game, and just has a melody and bass line.    
[Two Party Members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwxKHST_I68&amp;t=16m31s) adds in a percussive-attack harmony line to accompany the melody.    
[Three Party Members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwxKHST_I68&amp;t=18m20s), and there's a high-pitched, chime-like ornamentation line added in.    
[Four Party Members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwxKHST_I68&amp;t=20m9s) adds in a horn-like <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and a left-to-right panning answer at the end of the main melodic phrases.    
[A Full Party of Five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwxKHST_I68&amp;t=21m58s) turns the whole thing into a sort of march, with a triplet timpani line and downbeat snare hits.

It's a pretty minor thing that I actually didn't notice for a long time (even though I grew up playing the game), but it adds a nice touch to complement your adventure. Generally, you only get your fifth party member shortly before the climax of a generation, so the march style lends some extra gravitas to that lead-up.
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2014-12-24 02:55:03 yellow_edge<br>Bernadette by The Four Tops (James Jamerson). He's basically playing a counter-melody that I think is even prettier than the main melody line.
</p></li><li><p><b>marchingband</b> 2014-12-29 12:44:24 Zashiony<br>The way I formatted this was weird, so here is my example answer (which is a shitty example)

1) Most of my friends are scattered about in random sections, so it's not a clear cut decision for me to make. It really could go six ways, but I would probably go with the alto saxes or mellophone. 

2) This would definitely be the alto sax section. I already own an alto and know how to play it, so this would be the easiest switch. Then again, I can always borrow a Bari sax and learn to play that fairly quickly. It just came down to personal preference. 

3) If you haven't already guessed, I would switch to alto sax. It's just way too convenient for me. What stopped me from saying low brass (on the Bari sax) was the melodic lines the altos usually play. Tenor saxes usually play anything from the melody, harmony, or sometimes <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. The melody is (naturally) always more fun for me to play.

Well of course it wasn't necessary, but it's a nice part of the song not many people get to hear (because it's really muddy and off to the distance in the actual song), and I wanted to bring it out.

Sure it was a bit loud, and I could have potentially lowered the volume for that specific part, but due to the limitations of putting songs into the game and because of the fact that I'm mixing 2 of the 3 parts for MML reasons, it would have been too much of a hassle. Pardon the confusion!

In the end, I'm content with the end result. It is one of my favorite of all the songs I've recreated into the game. Thank you for the feedback!

The lead guitar comes back in with the pre-chorus riff that mimic's the "My Mama she told me don't worry about your size" line, but the guitar lick is left to itself - I would have had those vocals drop in at this point as well, to finish out the song with this <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

I think a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> of some sort with an instrument in the mids, maybe a piano of some sort playing a fast melody would make the beat even better and a pad playing quietly in the background. Or even you could use the bassy notes on the piano as a counter bass so theres a bit of variation compared to the 808. Other than that everything sounds cool and legit man. Future would love a beat like this. Just need a Young Metro adlib and you're gold lol.

Good work. What DAW do you use?
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-01-03 03:05:10 xavierthemutant<br>yo the thing with sound choice is it always feels corny to you, but 99% of the time other people will not care. as far as composition goes, everything is in the same key, following the chord progression nicely. I'd try a longer chord progression instead of a two chord, try something along 4 bars. Like i-ii-i-v is one I use a lot in minor keys, sounds very dissonant and spooky.

don't be afraid to change the melody up, or add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. for counter melodies, i like to change the sound to something a bit lighter, and just harmonize with your main melody. Like keep the root note of each bar, and then go to the third, then the fifth, or something along those lines...

If you don't get what I'm saying at all, please please please go study some music theory. there's so many tutorials out there and it makes everything so much easier. 

disclaimer: i'm trash at producing. and i like this. so maybe don't listen to me too much.

I loved all the hat rolls, they added a lot to the atmosphere and kept it interesting. The melody loop was also cool, and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on the left complemented it really well.

Main gripe was the 808, it was really muddy and overpowered a lot of the track. The track could have also used some more variation.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2018-01-03 16:53:37 MonksMoodStabilizer<br>Pretty much all night I've been reading about stride and rag techniques out of this book I got called Jazz Piano: The Left Hand. Let me tell you some of the things I read about you might like to hear.

Seemingly in every example, but not all the time, there is some movement in the midrange chord in the left hand the second time each measure.

A great set of techniques I learned about in the book are how to use tenths. I overlook tenths because I can't practically stretch them, but you can roll them and arpeggiate them. They say a G major 10 can be a G major or E chord, and a G minor 10 can be a G minor, G diminished, E half diminished, Eb major, or Eb dominant seventh. You can use them as the bass.

You can also do tenth triads, usually the fifth, minor or major sixth, or minor or major seventh. The book says tenth triads are very frequent and important.

You can do rollled or backwards tenths, octaves, or other intervals. A roll in this sense  would be like an eight note tie leading into a tenth or octave, backwards or fowards. So at the last eight of a measure you can hit a D, then go F# for the first quarter of the next measure, sustaining the D in the bass. Backwards or forwards. The book says this is often played only on the first beat or in passing on three and four.

If rag were all oompah all the time, it would sound bad, which your composition gets toward. Breaking it up with octaves or tenth triads would be good. Another thing to mix it up is with is to repeat or anticipate the bass octave. Instead of bass-chord-bass-chord, it could be bass-chord/bass-bass-chord/bass-bass where the chord/bass is the chord moving to the bass or a leading tone of the bass in eights. You can anticipate it by doing the backward roll mentioned above.

The song Charleston Rag demonstrates a technique better than I can explain. It's essentially anticipated octaves scaling up and down the bass. You can do this with an added fifth on each high note.

Probably my favorite artist they used as an example of technique in this book is Donald Lambert. One of the things he did was maintain a single note as the bass note for several measures, like it would keep coming back to B even though the midrange chord was changing. He used it in Anitra's Dance, which is a great song. The book says no one else really used it at the time, although it was later used by Ellington and Monk.

You can use tenth triads as a walking bass, but the book recommends huge hands. That's not the composer's problem. 😉

The book says Donald Lambert had smaller hands and couldn't reach a tenth like many stride guys, but with the above rolling technique, he would reach twelfths and above. The book pairs this rolling example with a contrapuntal bass demonstration, where you hit the bass note on one, the twelfth or above on two, a contrapuntal development on three, and the bass again on four.

Simplified bass stride consists of a bass note (root, fifth, or flat fifth), and some kind of combination of third, fifth, and seventh, within two octaves.

Something you did in the song that you could have done more of were back beats. Back beasts are basically deviations from bass-chord-bass-chord to stuff like bass-bass-chord-bass or chord-bass-bass-chord. The book says the only rule is not to do the same midrange chord twice. The book says it acts as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the bass. Octaves and tenths apply heat too. You can also have the bass walk when doing this.

The most challenging thing the book has described so far or so it says is interrupted stride. Stride is just 1 2 3 4 at its root. Interrupted stride is doing what ought to be happening on those beats, except an eighth note early, then sustaining it for the next beat. You can offset the whole measure like this. It's hard to describe, but the book recommends the songs The Baltimore Todolo by Eubie Blake (bars 65-67) and Concentratin by Willie "The Lion" Smith (1939, bars 91-94 and 118-121) for examples.

A simpler technique is the reverse stride. It's just chord-bass-chord-bass.

That's all I've read so far. I hope you've gotten something out of my comment.

Definitely something spacey, what I would suggest is keeping the synths you have right now, use that as a chorus, then alternate them, generally speaking, you could create a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to start off the verse of the track. It does sound a bit hollow on the low end though, I think fixing those 808s should be the aim if you wanna continue with this beat, tons of tutorials on how to get a crisp sounding 808 out there. Great concept though!

i dig you're little sampled beat too. i think that when you get that initial idea going, it's good to listen to some tunes that inspire you and use some techniques they do in your tune. im talking structure wise here because it did get a little repetitive since there was no section change or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

hope this helps in some way 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-01-06 15:10:28 ApexShaman<br>Keep it simple. Make a melody that isnt basic but isn't too crazy, make a top line melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> over it. Add the other melody every 8 bars or what have you depending on BPM. Use enough drums so you can take from the verse without it being too empty and there you go. That's the most useful formula and what most producers use
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-01-06 19:54:17 TheToppa<br>I'm feeling that drop my dude! Could have hit a bit harder but it was definitely doing work the way it is!

One thing I would have liked to hear is a drop out of the melody. For like 8 bars you could drop it out, maybe add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, or just half of the original melody to make some chorus room. It would split out the track nicely and added some breathing room. The joint in the middle was nice but I was feeling that as more of a bridge of such rather then some chorus room. 

Regardless, this beat is pretty heavy and carries heat with it! I think the repetitive nature wouldn't be picked up on if you laid some vocals on top of it! Good stuff homie!

Dropped this recently, looking for any feedback you have to offer, give it a listen if you got time!

A theme, though, is a developed version of a motif. So Rey's Theme is a full theme containing a few distinct motifs within it (a primary theme, a bridge section, a counter-melody, etc). Rose's is probably more of a theme because it's developed as the film progresses, and is used to signify a lot of major character/action beats.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-08 06:48:33 broodfood<br>I understand what they mean by it having compositional problems, but it's not the chord progression in particular. It has to do with how the melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> are arranged over it. There's a lot of times when the two melodies play the same or almost the same notes, and it blends them together and it's hard to follow one or the other. Or the melody emphasizes non chord tones in a way that doesn't really pay off or feel deliberate.

Since most of theory is concerned with harmony, what chords lead where and what to call such and such scale, I don't think you'll find the answers there. 

That said, I'm not sure exactly where you would find the answers. A song production blog or something? And in the end, your song isn't terrible or anything, it's just hard to listen with an outsiders ear when you've been living inside a track for however long you've worked on it. Besides, art is subjective and etc etc.

I use LMMS to write the parts for the songs -melody, chords, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, etc- and export them to Traction. In traction, I can arrange, edit, and tinker with each individual part. It also allows for good control over samples, so I use it to add &amp; edit beats and other samples. Lastly, I use audacity to make final changes and to polish the song how I want it before I upload it anywhere, like amplification, filters, and volume control.

The progression of the beat was dope but it gets repetitive, I would use a break somewhere within the beat, specifically for the percussion. The wind flute <b><u>counter melody</u></b> was working super nice, I think maybe if you dropped out some of the percussion and added that wind flute melody, it would create a dope chorus room and keep the beat progressing even further!

Apart from that, you seem to have it on lock!

You have the right idea. The vibe is good, that guitar loop is nice. Drums need a lot of work, the kick especially. They are really getting lost in the track. Research how to mix/eq your drums to have them cut through the mix. Experiment with layering your drum sounds. Look into sidechain compression. Your drums are also very bland. From what I could tell 1 kick sound, 1 snare sound, and 1 hi hat that comes in part way through. Adding things like little percussion sounds, open hi hats, hats with different volume/panning/patterns, will give variation and make your beat more full. A little goes a long way. 

Secondly, the loop needs variation. Change it up somehow, either by chopping and rearranging the pattern, or adding effects or other instruments. I could easily see a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> being played by a different instrument to compliment your guitar loop. If you have no musical background, look for samples that could compliment.


Keep practicing. Drums and variation is probably the biggest issue with 90% of the posts on this sub, so you're not alone. You've got the right idea. Keep at it.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-01-20 17:48:27 BlankFace45<br>Your drums are on point,  the mix is good, and the melody is good, I just think it could benefit from a higher quality sound selection.

The melody is really dope, reminds me of a Hollywood Undead type of beat for some reason. It also progresses nicely! The 808's are really clean. My only critique would be that it's pretty basic in nature you feel? Nothing really stood out to me, maybe if you added a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something to make it more memorable it would stick to the listener more? It would also come off as more professional.

Jokes aside, this is pretty lit, you definitely got that classic trap vibe (though I would advise for you to make your tracks more memorable, make something unique about it).

The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in at 0:38 is completely off flow my dude, doesn't mesh at all. I would go back and look into that personally. Mix is sounding solid, master needs to be louder!

Just dropped my weekly track! I was sick so my voice sounds a little weird, aside from that, let me know what I could have improved!

Only critique would be variation, I know that's the most annoying feedback but I feel that if you were to add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> it would just sound more professional you feel? Apart from that though it's some heat!

Dropped this track yesterday even though I was sick so excuse the voice hah! Let me know if you fw it!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-01-23 02:27:49 kanemezzmerr<br>Thanks I will deffo give some <b><u>counter melody</u></b> ago again. I tried writing melodys over it and some did work but I changed the vibe completely and I didn't like it. I guess I just need to keep working on it. Yes there is a sub that follows the pads and glides with it, just on the root notes; I could try and accentuate it or add another 'mid sub' low in mix for them kind of speakers! Good to know it wasn't coming through on your speakers. Maybe it was though and it just blends with the pads and doesn't have its own bassline to stand out. 

You are right that there is a slight low pass on the master. As well as more so on a lot of the instruments. I was working towards keeping the track warm and not too bright and lo fi but I will try other methods if the low pass on the master is hurting the track. 

This is amazing feedback thank you. Gives me something to work towards as I struggle and just keep using trial and error to make stuff. 


</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-01-23 03:57:18 kanemezzmerr<br>I don't feel the vocals are too loud, I think there is some frequencies clashing in the low end that creates a bit of mud in the low just! Volume wise I think it sounds good.  There is something about the amount of low end I really like though. I think it could just be cleaned up a little bit! I really like the female vocals in the background. It goes so well. The track is very chill and the vocals and vocal mix is damn good!

If you could give me feed back on https://soundcloud.com/kane-jordan-2/lofi-18   that would be amazing! It's a chill/lofi mix sort of vibe. I'm afraid there isn't enough because of lack of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and using the same two chords through out but I struggle to imagine what could go over it?
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-01-24 01:44:00 TheToppa<br>Really digging this, I've been enjoying beats with guitars incorporated into them quite a bit lately! Personally, at the beginning I was definitely vibing to this, but as the track progressed it got really simple you feel? I honestly think a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or some chorus room would do this beat justice. It's got a solid foundation, everything in terms of the technicalities is on lock, it's just the monotone nature of it that gets to me. Hope that helps!

Dropped this track on Sunday even though I was sick so excuse the voice! Let me know any improvements I can make.

</p></li><li><p><b>Jazz</b> 2018-01-24 12:44:11 m0rk54<br>Listen to lots of jazz.  Don’t be the type of musician who only learns tunes from the book, listen to a couple a different versions of each tune you play for inspiration.  You mentioned Autumn Leaves; perhaps the most famous jazz recording of this is from Cannonball Adderly’s Something Else record, Bill Evans’ Trio has a great version as well (both of these are in Gm which is the usual key this song is played in, not Em like in the real book).  Try learning the intro from Cannonball’s record.  

Don’t be like a jazz combo I saw at a cafe a few years back.  The first tune they called was Freddie Freeloader, everyone pulled out their books and the piano player never played Wynton Kelly’s <b><u>counter melody</u></b> which is essential to the tune but not notated in the lead sheet.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-01-24 17:10:13 TheToppa<br>I was wondering where you disappeared to! It's definitely something different than what I've previously heard from you. I think the melodies are really well made, as you said they are a bit generic but most trap beats are. What I really enjoyed about this one was the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, definitely helps it progress nicely!

One thing I didn't really enjoy were those claps, they seemed pretty stock to me and I though they weren't really processed at all. Just something I picked up on! Glad you're back dude, excited to see more from you!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-01-26 02:42:10 alexmjjohson<br>The drum variance is really good, but I think the song needs a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. The main piano line is fine, but it becomes a bit stale after a while.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-26 14:14:26 blueyeswhiteprivlege<br>I love the music from this game (imo it's one of the best video game soundtracks ever written and basically my childhood), so I'll try to analyze and explain the piece as best as I can (sorry if I go a little too heavy on the jargon or get a little obtuse, I tend geek out about this stuff lol):

You can essentially break the actual composition down into four parts: the bassline, the arpeggiated accompaniment, the melody, and a single <b><u>counter melody</u></b> part (if you can even call it that, it's basically just the melody a third above). There's also a tambourine I think, but that's not important. I'll tackle the accompaniment first.

The accompaniment is based on a repeating chord 8-bar chord progression (F: I | iii V7/vi | vi V+/vi** | I viiø7/V*** | IV | ii | V7sus4 | V7 :||). The only time it ever deviates from this progression is in the bar-and-a-half pick-up, which is just a simple I64 - V65 to lead into the main part of it. The accompaniment pattern is also constant. It ascends up the chord for one beat, then "accents" the second beat by adding an interval, and then the last note descends back down to lead into the next chord on the 3rd beat of the measure or the 1st beat of the next measure. That's the typical pattern, but it does mix it up a little bit for some added flavor.

The bassline's even simpler. The rhythm's a constant:

♩ , ♪ ♪ ♩ ♪ | ♩ , ♪ ♪ ♩ ♪ | ♩ , ♪ ♪ ♩ ♪ | ♩ , ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ :||

with the commas (,) representing 8th rests. It never deviates from this rhythm (not counting the pick-up, obviously). Ever. 99% of the time, the bass part is just playing chord tones, and it's usually just the root and 5th of the chord. The range is usually within C2-C3 centering around F, but it does drop down to B♭1 a couple of times and hits C4 a few times too. Interestingly, the rests on the start of the second beat and the quarter note getting "tied" into the 4th beat both happen when the accompaniment part is adding those intervals in for emphasis. Basically, the bass takes a break twice a measure so as not to distract from the accompaniment. I think that's a really clever little detail!

Ok, so, one of the most important things about the bass and accompaniment is how simple it is. There's two reasons for this: 1) it's good for looping the track endlessly, and b) the unconvential (by VGM standards at least) chord-progression provides enough interest so as to not be boring, and the constant rhythm and accompaniment pattern lets the melody (the mainy focus here) take center stage and doesn't distract from it. It also establishes a nice little groove in there too, which is a bonus. Finally, the lack of any sort of complex counterpoint lends to the "homely" or "folksy" vibe of the piece, which I think fits well with Littleroot. 

Now, obviously, the melody is what really creates a lot of the "charm" here. There's really only one melody here, and then two variations on it before it loops again. It's an 8-bar period, divided into two 4-bar phrases. The first phrase is rhytmically more exciting (it uses a lot more dotted quarter notes and eighth notes), and the second is more "lax" (relying more on half notes). This gives a good contrast between the two phrases to keep it more interesting. The rhythm is also kept incredibly simple, and it doesn't use a lot of unusual or fast-paced rhythms or long-winded scale runs.

Melodically, it sticks mainly to steps and skips and other intervals that are easy to sing.  Most of the larger leaps are confined to the start of motives in the melody, and usually come after longer notes. This makes the melody more singeable, since those simple steps fit nicely in the human voice and it allows a little time to breathe before tackling those larger leaps. The overall choice of notes is also important. Outside of those grace notes, the only chromatically altered tone in the melody is a single C#, which only occurs on the second part of the 4th beat of the measure and is obviously part of a cadence. It also doesn't throw much weight into the leading tone, which I think also adds to the folksy charm of it. A lot of Folk melodies just flat out avoid the leading tone (and, usually, the 4th), and most of the E's here are passing tones or neighbor tones. There's one (one!) exception to it, and it occurs at the end of the period. Ditto with the 4th of the scale. Also, side note: the first phrase tends to hover around the 3rd (A), while the second focuses more on the tonic (F).

It's also important to note that the melody is mostly made up of reoccuring and varied motives. Those grace notes are one: they always occur on the strong beat and are always a half-step below the target note. They also frequently come right before the higher notes of the piece, which makes it a little easier to "slide in" to those high notes and makes it more singeable imo. The first phrase regularly plays around with that three note ascending motive that shows up in the pick-up a lot. The second phrase also has some blatant motives too: it regularly hits the tonic F with those long notes and has that two-beat descending pattern.

The two variations mostly play around with timing and adding a bit of spice to the melody. There's a lot more syncopation (usually by delaying the first beat by an eighth note by shortening the first note of a measure and adding an eighth note on the first beat), and the first variation adds a few more grace notes and doubles the melody in parallel thirds. The second variation is a lot more different and focuses more on playing with the slower second phrase, which creates a sort-of contrasting middle section. It's playing with that sense of "there, and back again" that forms the basis for pretty much all music. It progressively gets farther and farther from the initial melody (home), before taking advantage of the medium restrains and using the loop to return "home". But, the whole time there's this "sense of home" buried within the more out-there variations on the melody. You can always pick out the motives that make up the melody in that second variation, no matter how "out there" it gets. I think that's fitting for the home town theme.

Also, instrumentation! Trading the melody and accompaniment parts off between different instruments creates a feeling of a folk band jamming and playing around with a melody, passing it back and forth between different members who all put their own spin on it. There's even a total unnecessary tambourine part! It also adds a lot of color to the melody and accompaniment and makes it even more interesting.

Hopefully that's enough detail! Go Ichinose is a mad genius.

Notes:

**  This is mostly just some good ol' fashioned Late Romantic voice leading here. The chord is better analyzed as moving chromatically from D - C# - C with the other two voices just being lazy bums and staying put. It's not really a strong function, but it sure sounds pretty!

*** It's a bø7 in the key of F, which is followed by a B♭ chord. You could label this as a viiø7/V, moving deceptively to IV - ii before going back to V (which could work I guess). But, again, I think it's just a Late Romantic Chromatic Voice Leading Chord (TM), with chromatic lines from C - B - B♭, the A remaining constant to keep that close chromatic relationship to B♭, and the C moving to D. There's also a random G on the last note of the measure in the accompaniment (the only NCT in the accompaniment part!), but that's just spice if you ask me.
</p></li><li><p><b>AboveandBeyond</b> 2018-01-28 07:03:06 filamint<br>The album is overall pretty great, for what it is! Really like Cold Feet, Sahara Love,Bittersweet &amp; Blue, Common ground, and the Inconsistency Principle. Always is gorgeous. Love A&amp;B theough and through, but I still have a few thoughts:
- The second break in 'Naked is... unbelievable. If A&amp;B could harness that layered complexity of melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in more of their clubby tracks I think they'd get the old vibe back with their modern sounds. "Northern Soul' is amazing as well, although my below comments apply
- I wish A&amp;B would pull back some of the subtle buildups from back in the day for the club tracks. A lot of these tracks just drop a heavy beat with virtually no buildup at all.
- When the drops hit, they seem to me, disjointed. This applies to nearly all of newer Anjunabeats records. Instead of layers, complexity of the building, subtle changes, it's just, 'boom, boom, (pause) boom boom boom boom'. (reminds me of banging my head against the wall). It's not that complex, super simple, and very predictable. This comment is for 'Alright Now' in particular. Another examples is the first drop of '7L&amp;JR - Higher Love' vs the second. Arty is doing it now too. Bayer does too, but then sometimes his more trancey records have gorgeous layers &amp; buildup. It's instant gratification vs. delayed!!!!
- I listened to group therapy right after CG and it reinforced what I'm missing. Still lovely music, but the club music could use a 'hot trance injection' from the past. I feel like 'Myon - Omen in the Rain' is a good example. Modern sounds but very complex, takes you there slowly...

I definitely think it's a clean mix, progressed nicely and with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> synths towards, it definitely didn't get repetitive. In terms of critique, only thing I would possibly change is making the hi hats just slightly louder, they are kind of back in the mix. Aside from that my dude, this is really heat!

The strange, daemonic flutists that surround him play their strange notes, disrupting the Music of the Ainur, but Iluvatar plays a counter-melody and incorporates them into the world - to be manifest as strange creatures and spirits like the Dweller in the Pool, and the great spider Ungoliant that is destined to drink the light of the Two Trees.

...or so the Valar told the Eldar, when they dwelt in Valinor. For Morgoth sought vainly for the Secret Fire by which Iluvatar crafted the world, and Morgoth was of an order with Shub-Niggurath, Yog-Sothoth, Bal-Sagoth, and the other spirits that had accompanied Azathoth, and in truth the world of Arda was but the prison of the Daemon Sultan, who is the Secret Fire; Iluvatar had but bent that power back upon itself to trap the interloper...for there is not power greater than Azathoth's own. So long as the Music of the Ainur continues, so shall Azathoth be imprisoned, but when the stars are right the music shall imprison him no more, and he will burst free from his prison, and all the works of Man, Dwarf, Eldar, and Valar shall be as naught.

Until then, only the dreams of Azathoth trouble the world - and few can hear them as clearly as Olórin, whose name means Dreamer, known to Men as Gandalf. For while Saruman and Sauron play their lesser games for dominion of Middle Earth, he is a servant of the Secret Fire, who works to hasten his coming...

...and Eru Iluvatar can only look with dread upon his creation, as his children play through their roles, and the melodies and Iluvatar and Azathoth play out in the minds and destinies of all creatures, so even the Valar know not that the song of Azathoth is in them as well, and that what they do has been foreordained. In the fullness of time, Azathoth will wake, and the world will burst, and Iluvatar is powerless against what may come after.

Great hi hats, the introduction to the beat was solid and overall I definitely enjoyed the vibe! In terms of improving, I would definitely boost that bass up, it's lacking quite heavy in comparison to the synths for instance. Speaking of the synths, I would turn them down, though they are really cool in concept, they get repetitive towards the end, either incorporate a break or maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Hope that helps!

 I like the pads and the drums are tasteful. The shakers might be too loud.

 Also, maybe a counter-melody could take place. Very subtly, though. 

Great job!
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-02-03 05:01:54 plasticide<br>Thank you! I like the idea of a counter-melody. I'll see if I can think of something...
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-02-03 07:18:55 johnumbaugh<br>- 0:00 - very compelling intro
- 0:09 - when the vocals came in, I thought, hmmmmm I don't think that this song will really be my cup of tea... but read on
- 0:36 - I immediately recognized and vibed on the time signature variation... almost like a 6/4 coexisting with a 5/4... this sounds really hot.
- 1:27 - by now I'm enjoying the vocals... much more ethereal... and feels more appropriate to the song, or maybe just more in line with what I'm used to.
- 1:42 - excellent.  The bass heaviness, as well as the medium-attack sine wave <b><u>counter melody</u></b> coming in through the middle (I'm sure you know what I mean :) )

Near the end of the song, once again vibing on the funky time signature.  Good job.  And good job overall on the song!

On a subsequent listen... I don't think I dislike the vocals as much as before... but I'm wondering if you've considered bringing them in a little bit more gradually at the beginning?  Maybe like a volume like you have at 1:26 and then crescendoing up to the current volume... or even a little softer.  It's just a little jarring at that volume initially... also it sounds like almost like there's a plosive at the beginning of when the vocals comes in... I'm sure it's a weird artifact but it was pretty jarring.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-02-03 09:34:19 johnumbaugh<br>- 0:13 - the contrasting themes are so contrasting but work so well together... great job
- 0:50 - I don't think I'm a fan of the vocals
- 1:03 and elsewhere - I don't think I'm a fan of that dissonant bass note... feels out of place... dissonance doesn't seem to be the theme in this piece... interesting counter-melody is the theme I think.  Go with that.
- 2:02 - kind a of like a funky wah thing going on here... really like this.  Still not sure about those vocals coming in later though
- 2:27 - Ugh, that dissonant bass note again... I would reconsider that pitch

Definitely well put together and some tremendous ideas here - I already knew this but it's clear that you have a lot of talent!  Well done.

I know my genre isn't really your thing but I'd definitely value your input: https://soundcloud.com/edgetriggered/hybrid-ambition .  It's an early work in progress but I'd appreciate any sort of input.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-02-04 06:01:53 thesego_211<br>Try listening critically to the big bands that you enjoy and want to emulate. See if you can chart out the form with as much detail as possible as to what the band is doing. Train your ear (or look at a score) to hear what each section is playing and how they are playing it, eg. unison/octaves/chords(4-way close, drop-2, etc).

Something like this:

Intro - 8 bars, rhythm section only, guitar Freddie Greene, piano fills

Head 

A - two altos in thirds, brass play a fill at the turnaround

A2 - altos again on melody, trumpets (at least 2 in unison, maybe all 4) add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, bones start comping in short staccato punches with spread voicings

Bridge - full band in brick shithouse Basie-style block chords

A - like A2, 2-bar lead in to a brass shout for next chorus

etc.

Really pay attention to how the composer/arranger handles the transitions between sections to keep the music flowing.


</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-05 18:16:45 TheToppa<br>Definitely appreciate when producers go the extra mile and actually pay attention to the visuals of the video as well!

The mix is on point, everything is clearly distinguished, I'm fucking heavy with the percussion on this but I gotta agree with the user below, the beat is so long, the strings get really repetitive, I would definitely try and use them less or just create a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

</p></li><li><p><b>Bedroom_Producers</b> 2018-02-05 18:50:23 Traktor1234<br>Some Feedback if youre interested:
First of all musically the track is really good, main melody, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, sound selection all works together pretty well. But these elements are way too loud in the mix. Your clap is way too soft you could push your 808 and kick a little and you gotta push your Hi hats you can bearly even hear them. All over make your drums stand out way more and youll be fine, because the Beat got potential. Keep Going!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-07 15:13:45 Shibo7<br>Wasn't ready for that <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, was thinking it was a reversed beat with drums over it. Nice work, my friends.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-08 00:22:08 TheToppa<br>I'm really feeling this beat to be honest! You got an awesome melody going on but the keys sound very thin you feel? I would definitely experiment with layering them. Also, reduce the reverb on the counter-melody that comes in later (the keys). The percussion sounds panned, I would make both the bongo-sounding drum and the snare mono. Hope that helps!

Dropped this on Sunday, I would classify it as "Indie Rap". Let me know if you feel it!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-08 07:36:54 Amangiechsin<br>This is a poor imitation of metro boomin. it's too skeletal when it needs to be full. the introduction of that one synth about a third into the beat was a nice <b><u>counter melody</u></b> but you should have incorporated it earlier in the chorus. your hi hats are over reverbed and way too loud and repetitive. I think you tried to do like a goosebumps thing with the 808 (I'm fairly positive they used a sub bass) but it failed because you used the spinz 808 so it sounded like there were quieter kicks going on. Work on your sound selection, mixing and variation.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-02-08 11:06:10 TheRNGuy<br>For me music theory is bunch of abstract concepts that you can intepret how you want. Just being aware those abstract ideas exist, and not see it as strict instruction to follow.

Many people who dont know theory for example, dont use contrasts or call/responce, counter-melody, or dissonance/consonance, polyrhythms. Different forms of progressions other than chords in intro or bridge. Different scales than Major.

Some of that stuff can be learned by reverse engineering projects or trying to analyze favorite music, and theory then will be "confirmation" or you will know how these ideas are called.

Theory allows to rely less on conventions of genre and improve it. Because theory concepts are used in most genres, in some form or another. And to "customize" your style, because everyone interpret theory different.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-02-08 12:31:49 VexxinVega<br>While there is no “one size fits all” approach, try following your bass drum. 

Bass is either felt or heard. Usually can’t do both. Maybe try solid sustained tones that just round out the bottom and build from there if you don’t want a moving part or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-02-09 03:32:20 ItsLewisC<br>I’m referring to the underlying harmony and not a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> of a main melody. So the verse goes C#(6/9), Eb(7/9), F#add9 etc... I wrote the chords underneath the melody. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-09 05:29:02 flower-fam<br>I like yours too. It has a spacey vibe to it that makes me feel like empowered and shit. I will say though that the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is a bit quiet when it comes in and it makes the track seem a bit repetitive. Other than that I loved it, keep up the good work!
</p></li><li><p><b>JazzPiano</b> 2018-02-09 05:32:30 robthesoundbank<br>One thing that is tough in solo piano contexts is you can often have 3 or 4 or even more roles to fill across your two hands:

1. Melody

2. Bass
3. Harmony

4. <b><u>Counter melody</u></b> or fills between the melodic phrases.

I find it especially tough to accomplish 2 and 3 together and adding in 4 is some real beast mode type shit.

You can work on techniques like stride to accomplish 2 and 3 together in the left hand or you could try doing mostly bass in the LH and using your RH to play block chords with the melody on top (or a mixture of both). Of course those are only a couple of the multitude of possibilities. But your choice of approach might inform your voicings (for example whether they are rootless or not).

...lol

Now that that's out of my system, thanks for the info!

I'm starting to see there is typically a specific inversion in mind which you can see based on the way the chords in the lead sheet are written. For example, in the key of C minor the lead sheet might say "Ebdim7" in one place and "Cdim7" in another. They're the same chord, so that tells me where the bass should be. From there, I can look at the chords before and after to see what notes move from one to the next. I'm seeing an unspoken rule of motion as I go that basically says "only move one or two notes at a time if you can help it." So you go from, say, F minor to D-7b5. You either just add the D or move the C to D (creating a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> like you mentioned in point 4) and move to the next chord. 

Anyways, I'm just writing out my observations because that helps me internalize them. This stuff is fun!

It’s a really reverb heavy track. To the point that I’m not sure it would be friendly to vocals. Would say to experiment more with counter melodies I’m addition to chord progressions. The bass line and the chords feel a little too barebones on themselves. 

I mean you’re relatively sound with the fundamentals of structure, snare placement, you clearly can make a decent <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with that guitar but that would be my sugggestion. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-10 06:12:39 SoFloDAntonio<br>I had a VERY quite <b><u>counter melody</u></b> going during the "verses" but they were meant to be subtle, I could definitely tweak on that!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-10 06:30:22 holyholy_suitcase<br>I thought I heard a water fall or some sort of FX running but I would definitely say that the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> should be quite noticeable. If you have your layer of chords, you'll have a melody, and in a way you want the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to be more distinct cause when it enters you want people to be like "fuck that shit hard/fire/lit/turnt/nice" 

granted I'm running on three hours of sleep so i may have missed your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> simple out of inattentiveness lol. 
</p></li><li><p><b>hiphopheads</b> 2018-02-10 11:50:22 WordsAreSomething<br>It's too reliant on the sample. You need a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or just some more layers there. Like it didn't even sound like it had a bass line. Without some more layers that sample would get super annoying very fast.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-11 22:03:55 TheToppa<br>Oh I'm rocking to this no doubt! Those 808's are doing work and the percussion on this is creating the right back bone to this! Only thing I would change on this is the clap, it feels like it's a bit too far upfront in the mix you feel? Maybe play around with the compressor or just lower the overall volume of it! I also would have liked to hear some variation on that melody, the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in later doesn't really last long enough for me to feel "refreshed". Try creating some chorus room with a different melody in the future, it's gonna help you with the progression of your track for sure!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-11 22:17:58 TheToppa<br>Wasn't sure what I was in for when I heard that intro but it definitely came together nicely. With that being said, I think most of your elements sound "thin", you feel? I would layer them and definitely play around with the compressor to really make your melodies "pop".

The percussion on this sounds "muffled" (precisely that snare). I would also bring up the bass on this, the low end is lacking pretty heavy.

Experiment with some variation to that melody, towards the end it was getting quite repetitive, maybe input some chorus room where you create a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to help things progress? Just a general tip!

Hope that helps!

Boom first element done, practice a similar motif, find something that compliments the first element (like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>) &amp; record that. Throw a Rhythm in their like a baseline or some drums &amp; the hard part is over.
The rest is just fills, rinse wash and repeat the first steps until you feel like the frequency field is full or to taste.
Takes me like five or ten minutes to get started, twenty minutes maximum to get all my ideas out &amp; recorded. 
Set up a pomodoro clock for twenty five minute intervals &amp; organize when to start &amp; stop in a song &amp; knock em out! 
My first 25 minutes I spend making it then I’ll put it to the side &amp; start another track in the next 25 minutes &amp; do the same. I’ll do it a third time for another twenty five before I take a twenty minute break &amp; then I move on to the mixing stage for those songs. Spend twenty five minutes mixing each one individually then I break for another twenty &amp; move on to the mastering stage. 
Know this isn’t a long time per track but it keeps me in my creative flow &amp; helps me put out 5-10 songs a day in about a 6-12 hour period &amp; this is a very competitive field if your starting any where from the bottom &amp; trying to make it a reliable revenue stream like I was. 
(Lil Jonny’s gonna have a hard time keeping up doing one song a day to your ten, &amp; the more you do the better you get! That why we get the big bucks, I can be in an artist email with a fresh pack of ten songs in a day compared to everybody else’s one song on YouTube every other week expecting people to come to them.. I feel like it’s helped me pay my bills to say the least.)
It also helps I have somebody in my production team double check my mix &amp; master but you sure can ask around to find a friend! 
It’s not perfect but hopefully it’ll get some ideas flowing! Good luck!

</p></li><li><p><b>Xenoblade_Chronicles</b> 2018-02-13 14:53:28 Gyakuten<br>I love everything I've heard so far (currently at Chapter 6), but there are 3 songs in particular that I keep coming back to. (Un)surprisingly, they're all Mitsuda tracks.

* [Elysium, in the Blue Sky](https://youtu.be/XOpammDfQjc). There are so many reasons why I'm in love with this song that I don't even know where to start. Hearing it at the end of the first trailer — and *immediately* recognizing Mitsuda's style — was what sold me on the game. The bassoon at the beginning is fucking *godlike*, the melody is simultaneously majestic, nostalgic, and mournful (and beautifully contrasted with the more hopeful counter-melody during the midsection), and overall it conjures up many of the same feelings as another legendary Mitsuda track, [The Scars of Time](https://youtu.be/fvs-L5Bufg8). I  wholeheartedly believe this will go down as one of the best main themes he's ever composed. If I have one complaint, it's that this song is criminally underused in-game (though the different variations kind of make up for it).
* [Shadow of the Lowlands](https://youtu.be/Gv5CifO4KtA). You know this one will be godly when it gets its own music video. I haven't actually heard this one in-game yet (just made it to Tantal), but I'm bracing myself for the moment it happens. The reason this song sticks out to me is because it conjures up memories of early SNES and PS1 JRPGs, when BGM was allowed to take center stage because voice acting hadn't taken over yet. A prime example would be [On the Shores of a Dream](https://youtu.be/OdFaE1ft1Lw) from Chrono Cross, which the game uses to signal a huge tonal shift that normally would've been done with a cutscene. Instead, the song just plays out of nowhere as soon as you hit the world map, and the emotional impact of it is staggering. I'm expecting Shadow of the Lowlands to have just as much of an atmospheric punch when I step foot into Theosoir.
* [Fonsett Village (Night)](https://youtu.be/r4t_j8GvSyE). There are songs that make you feel at home, like the Day version of this song. There are songs that relax and refresh you, like the Garfont theme. But I don't think I've heard another piece of music that so brilliantly captures the idea of "homecoming" as much as Fonsett Night. The opening flute sounds like an old friend calling out to you from the distance. Things settle down after the initial greeting, so he chats with you in a jolly voice, not unlike a bouncy flute melody. From there, the swelling strings capture the waves of nostalgia as you wander back into your hometown. And just when you think you've seen all the old locales, relived all your old memories, you catch sight of your old home, and suddenly a deep, bellowing sob erupts from your throat — like a cello that was waiting for just the right moment to join in and cleft the listener's heart in twain. *Mitsuda, you've done it again.*
</p></li><li><p><b>videos</b> 2018-02-13 15:43:58 AmateurHero<br>If you can write it for the instrument you're most comfortable with, it's pretty easy with notation software to transpose the parts.

Start by diving the music into basic parts like melody, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, supporting parts, and bass line. Make the entire arrangement this way. Then divvy it up. The instruments that plays a given part (like main melody) in the original piece will get that part by default.

Group similar sounding instruments together like flutes, clarinets, and alto saxophones. Unless it's a solo where that instrument's sound is the focal point of that part, let the instruments play in unison.

Keep dividing the parts until each instrument has an assignment. Make sure not to shoehorn an instrument into a given part for the sake of fairness. Bass instruments like the tuba will carry a bass line for 95% of pieces with nothing specifically remarkable about most of their part. Don't throw the main melody that was played on an oboe to the tuba just so that the tuba can have a moment in the limelight. You're doing the whole arrangement a disservice.

And there you have it - basic tips for arranging a piece. 
</p></li><li><p><b>TheStrokes</b> 2018-02-13 16:09:46 lastseptember20<br>Fuck, I'm so tired, but I'll do my best.

Basically, each of the tracks shows a development, and you can find traces of what will eventually coalesce and evolve into the Voidz aesthetic.

Is This It (the song), for example - This has a use of counterpoint harmony (the bassline against the vocals - also see TIOLI with the guitar against the vocals in the verse), which ends up playing a crucial part in much, if not all, of Julian's later songwriting. He starts off very simply, but effectively, as a composer, with it in this song. By the time of FIOE &amp; Phrazes, there is an absolute *mastery* present on Julian's part (think Ize, 11th Dimension, Glass). But, by Tyranny, he demonstrates a desire to push even further by moving beyond the conventional Minor/Major scales that were prevalent in the early Strokes albums; the songs become modal by way of incorporating strains of world music via just enough conflation with the conventional to entice Western audiences. You can identify something similar with LISITM, where there's what he called a 'brazillian thing' going on in the verse. In essence, he dipped his toe in with the solo in Vision of Division and Tourist with regard to this, but then allowed himself to go *all out* with Tyranny, where he was completely uninhibited by the expectations imposed upon the Strokes, a very commercial act. 

And, more importantly, with the Voidz, he is extremely interested with bizarre dissonance, unheard of chord progressions, and atonality in order to explore harmonies that simply did not exist before he wrote them; he's like fucking Coltrane or Brian Wilson. I once read someone compare it to sex; once you've done the normal stuff for ages, you become disinterested, because there's no novelty or exploration, so you start to get kinkier. On Is This It, he showed a fundamental understanding of the rules of music. Throughout the next decade, he mastered them. And on Tyranny, he pushes past them.  This was a *major* feature of Phrazes, but especially River of Brakelights, which is just insane from a harmonic standpoint. Basically, he's gone from arranging things/harmonies well, but somewhat traditionally and conventionally with Is This It, to somewhat more complex (think the chorus of Reptilia with Albert's part), to FIOE &amp; Phrazes &amp; Angles where he's starting to go batshit but still working towards a palatable/accessible result, to Tyranny, where his songwriting and arranging is utterly idiosyncratic and groundbreaking.

And through all this, he mixes and balances beautiful melodies &amp; arrangements with sheer aggression, deceptive control, homages to punk &amp; avant-garde rock albums like White Light/White Heat, and unhinged, breakneck rhythms that sound like the song is a runaway train that might just derail at any moment. Think of it like this, Take it or Leave it --&gt; The Way It Is --&gt; Vision of Division --&gt; River of Brakelights --&gt; Metabolism --&gt; 50/50 -------&gt; MAD/Crunch Punch/Where No Eagles Fly/Business Dog. With Tyranny, as opposed to something like 'The Way It Is' which sounds tame by comparison, the difference is that the train pretty much does fucking derail in the most abrasive moments of the album. 

And it's in more ways than one - think the bizarre 'Qualia' section in Father Electricity or, Xerox, or the high-pitched outro of Nintendo Blood; they all push past melodic/harmonic conventions by warping the musical elements found all the way back in the Strokes' debut - that's why so many of his fans couldn't comprehend or stomach the album. Casablancas pushes everything single fucking aesthetic element that he has been utilising/deploying/pursuing throughout his entire career - incorporation of counter-melody/bizarre harmonies, aggression, etc. to their breaking point, which is also their *ultimate* point. He had to follow his vision/progression, no matter how alienating the results were ('this is for nobody'). In so doing, he attained originality, a personal style that his wholly *his*.

Now, all that he did with this experimentation and exploration has been distilled into something that is much more recognisable with the Virtue songs, but it's coming from the same place. It's just that he wants to tame down his results/findings in a more neatly presented package so that other people can enjoy what he discovered in his musical exploration as much as he and his fellow Voidz-brothers did. 
</p></li><li><p><b>videos</b> 2018-02-13 21:02:57 rab7<br>This is anecdotal, but I've made small ensemble arrangements before. I start by breaking down the song into Bass, Melody, Harmony/counter-melody, and what I call "driving engine in between" because I'm not sure what the right term is.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-15 09:11:36 yungxcowboy<br>Overall it's a pretty good track. I would add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the main melody. Add an 808 to make the track pop. It needs a heartbeat. It needs more work. Keep at it man.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-02-16 06:14:23 tyleremeritus<br>Maybe try writing some counter melodies for one of them. Like follow the chords and try to write some simple melodies to fill in the gaps. 

Maybe for the verses the piano plays chords and guitar plays some single note melodies. Then they switch roles for the chorus. Big, full guitar chords to make the chorus in your face.  While the piano plays some <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that responds to vocal lines.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-02-21 04:51:14 OrganicChemistrysux<br>Generally, your bass melody should play a note that's in the chord and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> should play  a note in the chord or the same one as the lead. 

I suggest learning more music theory. Understanding the pentatonic scale will help you a lot.


</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-02-21 05:26:49 FLgang4life<br>Thanks for your response but when I said "base" melody it wasn't a typo I didn't mean bass cuz i usually use 808's and use the root note of the chords. But my issue is harmonizing like I said even when I stay in key it still sounds like it doesn't make any sense when the chord progression, lead melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> are all playing together
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-02-21 06:12:30 OrganicChemistrysux<br>Most notes of the melody will be in pentatonic scale. They won't cause that much tension generally. The two other notes that make up the minor scale will cause tension generally.

Too many different rhythms will often cause chaos as well. <b><u>Counter melody</u></b> rhythm is generally pretty simple and repetitive. 

Lead melody rhythms are often over 2 or 4 bars. The ladder would have bar 1 and 3 have the same rhythm. 2 and 4 would be similar

 Trap beats often have triplet rhythms on the high hats. Try having the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or lead follow it
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-21 23:33:42 spookymilkspills<br>Improve the first melody you have playing. The sound feels off compared to what u have going on.

</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2018-02-22 03:52:37 JimGerm<br>From RTM:

Math rock is a genre that developed in the late 1980s to early 1990s via the influence of bands such as Slint, Drive Like Jehu and Shellac who added to the already established sounds of Noise Rock and Post-Hardcore a sense of rhythmic variety and complexity that was claimed by many critics to sound almost mathematical, eventually being coined "math rock". It became a large influence on some underground movements in the US and became a common instrumental style of certain genres including many bands of the Midwest Emo and Indie Rock scene. 

By the dawn of the 21st century the sound of math rock was even more riff focused. Emphasised by polyrhythmic and winding yet consonant guitar riffs with the bass often used as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, vocals were usually used as a secondary instrument to the guitar or not at all. The genre took further influences from Jazz-Rock and Post-Rock often sounding both accessible and experimental with the dissonance of earlier math rock groups being far less dominant. Modern math rock groups include Don Caballero, Hella, 65daysofstatic and Tera Melos. Some modern groups have also acquired mainstream success whilst using math rock influences. These bands include Battles, Minus the Bear and Foals that further show math rock's gradual divergence from the underground.

I like your song. Good vocal samples. I like the vinyl 70s popping sound you got going through the whole song and that lowpassing you did in the middle of the song. I would personally get a higher piano/harp instrument in the register and play that as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, like a couple arpeggios after the first piano. This is a bit like a mid-2000s Jay Z kinda joint. 

Joints hot though. I always find it interesting that people can make songs out of sampling loops and chopping them through the song.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2018-02-25 04:03:13 S1GNL<br>9 of 10 times I start with exploring sounds - synth presets or any kind of sample bank and improvise for fun. If a sound "matches" a melody then I check the scale/key I'm in and write down the chords (triads) to each note. From there on it's a wild exploration aligned with the music theory rules.
The other time I play around with a basic piano preset until I get something useful and continue to write melodies for the bass, leads and accompanying/counter melodies with the piano.
Later I'll just use other sounds for each melody - or just keep the piano e.g. for the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

What I've experienced is that deciding what tempo to use before hitting a single note is the best way to get creative fast and stay on track.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-02-26 03:09:03 Fox1jd<br>Thanks man. Drums sounded good in your mix. Everything was super balanced well mixed. I would’ve maybe tossed in a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for variation. Either way cool track
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-02-27 03:24:02 MitzeMitchell<br>Good afternoon, Genialx!

I remember this feeling.  I primarily composed for solo instrument until my Monday night band director saw one of my WIPs.

My advice: think about it the same way you approach composing for string orchestra/smaller ensemble.  The core musical material (melody, harmony, bass line, and counterpoint/<b><u>counter melody</u></b>) should remain (essentially) the same either way.  The difference is how you approach the instrumentation.

What helped me the most with instrumentation/orchestration is thinking about entire groups rather than individual instruments.  Think woodwind texture or brass texture.  Think sopranos or tenors.  Whatever works best for you.  Once you have this general group, you can narrow it down to the specific instruments much easier.

Hopefully, this helps.  If you'd like, shoot me a message [here](http://www.mitchellmakesmusic.com/ask-mitchell).  I'd be more than happy to take a listen and give feedback.

Cheers!
</p></li><li><p><b>AskReddit</b> 2018-02-27 22:07:28 Bad-Brains<br>I think from a technical standpoint, Odd Soul by Mutemath is one of my favorite *produced* albums. The mixes for every song are absolutely perfect, even down to the tone of the instruments themselves. Paul Meany's vocals are perfect for this music and it just works for Mutemath. To me, this album is prime Mutemath.

Take [Heads Up](https://youtu.be/2ENHcPnrBSo) - the guitar and bass do the same lick, but you can tell that each has their own distinct sound. The way it's mixed is incredible to me - they blend and are yet distinct. Like two people in a relationship together that have decided, "No more fooling around, we're committed, let's get serious about this," and then move forward acting as a team comprised of individuals working toward a common goal (which I think ties in to the lyrics).

Then there's [Blood Pressure](https://youtu.be/cv2mjAgFTaI) whose thumping bass line is reminiscent of a pulse. Each part is mixed so well that they are distinct, full of life and character, yet cohesive. It reminds me of the mix for The Distance by Cake - tons of distinct parts all doing something different to turn into something cohesive called a song; melody + <b><u>counter melody</u></b> + <b><u>counter melody</u></b> + some more counter melodies = song. It shouldn't work but somehow it does. This is a shadow of that Cake song, but it's still there in its own way.

[One More](https://youtu.be/1AGldIFNgfg) evokes feelings of a heist to me. Listen to it and imagine Danny Ocean, and all of the moving pieces working in tandem to get that painting. The drums - specifically the snare - have a perfect tone to me. Subdued, yet punchy and present at the same time. The bass has this deep round tone just on the edge of breaking up into distortion, and yet trods along like there's nothing wrong. This might be sappy, but it sounds triumphant - this is who I am, this is who I'm meant to be.

The album ends on [In No Time](https://youtu.be/GkT9VX0-jDM). The frenzy of the previous songs is behind us now. You know that feeling of well earned rest? Like you've been working in the yard all day to clear out underbrush or overgrown bushes or even mowing the grass? You lay down after a relaxing shower, slip into a deep sleep with no alarm set - that's what this song feels like for me. The experience is complete, and you are gently eased back into reality. That's what this song feels like to me.

I like how the bass line creates a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the main voice, and how you switched up the drum patterns through out. I'd maybe re-examine the piano line at the end, and try to make it either fit in the key of the whole beat, or switch up the progression underneath to fit what the piano is doing.

1. You can start with anything. Melody can be a good start, but so can a bass line, a drum pattern, a horn refrain, a chord progression! Mix up the focal point of the song to keep it fresh. 

2. I like to build out. So from the focal point I expand the circle with other instruments. A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> / harmony / chord comping / drum pattern -- I try to add them around what I have.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-03-02 06:17:52 Tingzorz<br>what a vibe! loving the main sample and the whole sound selection overall. maybe you could play around a bit more with the hi-hats by panning them in the stereo field. you can also add a counter-melody to the second half of the track to make it more interesting. other than that, I really enjoyed this, keep up the good work!

We basically wrote a bunch of two-part songs and expanded them where we felt like we could.

</p></li><li><p><b>tango</b> 2018-03-07 02:39:13 bandoneonista<br>I can’t resist adding more, since I just finished a bandoneon lesson. You have 3 strong rhythmic instruments ( bass, piano, bandoneon), you might think in terms of dividing “jobs”: so bandoneon or piano is either doing rhythm or melody, *but not both at once*, if you know what I mean. Bass is always rhythm. That’s a given. Dedicate one of the three remaining instruments to the function of rhythm, one to melody, one to counter-melody or harmony, then switch functions in the next section... much cleaner sounding, and more variety of color. Violin can play a long note that floats over the melody, that’s typical. Or he can chug along rhythmically, playing double stops (2 strings at once). Or, he can play melody, of course! It’s good to have either bandoneon or piano always on the rhythm with the bassist, as just violin and bass holding down rhythm is a bit anemic for dancing. And sounds weird. But otherwise you can really mix up functionality; just don’t make one instrument do two things at once. You can also double the melody, or if you’re feeling feisty, all three can play in unison for a measure or two! Yeeeee haaawwww! ;-)
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-03-07 06:28:47 Kirby64Crystal<br>If it looks as though a B flat belongs there, then put it there. If it looks like an A# goes there, then put that there. The few times I see B flat though, I think it works. Perhaps try both and see which looks better?

Another suggestion I just thought of...

Have you thought about an introduction? I think it could help solidify the bass line and help the other instruments be heard (at least at the beginning). 

Also, another aspect that needs improvement is the counterpoint between the bandoneon and the violin. It is jaunting hearing the violin have the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the beginning when it is the higher instrument. I wish musescore sounds weren't so terrible so I could hear what this sounds like live and help you even more...

Take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. I'm not a professional at the tango but I will use my compositional knowledge to help you as best as I can anyways :)

Take that riff and expand upon it. Base the whole song around that riff. After the first 15 seconds,you lose it all sense of a melody. Starting around 1:40 you have a brief moment of "melody/<b><u>counter melody</u></b>", a call and response, a classic musical trope. That was good.

I have a question for you: What is music to you? To most people, music is organized sound. A really convenient way to organize sound is to use the concepts we know as musical theory. You need to learn about those concepts if you want to make music that people will want to listen to.

I hope you keep it up and improve from here
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2018-03-07 10:50:29 awkwardlylong<br>Hey man,

I really like this, progression is great!

I agree with the other commenter, during the future bass saw chords section some impact is lost due to having no sub frequencies, a nice 808, or a simple reese bass following the chords should help with that. Love the structure of it, going from rock towards the chord sections though! It is very creative, and doesn't feel like you just smashed two genres together, it really comes together. 

Other things that may be nice to add:
 For your second half of each drop 1:10 and 2:20, I think a more aggressive top lead would help drive it up a bit, that second higher pitch lead layer could have some distortion thrown on it and maybe not follow so closely with your main lead, with maybe a few licks on it.

I would generally double up that lead melody you have with some more interactive layers, since it gets a bit static throughout the drop. I like your drop chord progression and volume automation though, the chords have a nice rhythm and sway to them.

One thing that is quiet but pokes out to my ear due to some sort of dissonance occurring, Is when you add this second <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that is fairly quiet at 1:43, i like it from 1:43 to 1:56, but then when the next main buildup guitar melody is added at 1:56, i dont think that backing melody is so great anymore, it adds some dissonance that is distracting, and a think the rise would be more impactful if this backing melody is dropped right at 1:56. But I do like it in the previous section. Hopefully you can get what I am saying. It also happens at 0:40, I just think something sound too dissonant, and slightly out of time with the delay you have on that guitar.

But yo man this song is dope, I really like the direction it is headed! Keep up with this one
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-03-07 11:20:19 InterstellarSounds<br>What's up man I really liked the track, especially the switch up in the middle! The drums sound pretty crisp for the most part in my opinion. This might just be me but the swell synth/strings in the second half sound a little off. I would put in a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> of some kind in the song as it gets kind of repetitive. I also really liked the echo ending.

Your beat's pretty dope. You really get that "shit's about to go down" vibe every trap producer tries making. All the elements work very well. Some people might say turn up those 808s, but I think you did good by letting the synths and main melody shine through. The melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> work perfectly. Drums are good too. Dope shit, keep at it!

</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2018-03-08 06:51:08 beangardener<br>Work on basic chord shapes and strumming folk songs. Simple melodies are a good suggestion too. Sectionals are also helpful - try to find pieces with simple melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and have small group performances. And make sure students are actively evaluating one another and their own performances with constructive feedback 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-09 20:47:40 4plus1<br>Here's a crazy theory: It's both. But not the way you think.

So you have this chord progression:

&gt; Bm - D - F♯m - E

Which works great both as a dorian and an aeolian progression:

&gt; i - ♭III - v - IV (dorian)

&gt; v - ♭VI - i - ♭VII (aeolian)

But compared to something like *'I - IV - V^7 - I'*, it doesn't hit you over the head with a *Perfect authentic cadence* to make sure there's really only one way to hear it. It could go both ways.

Which means that the other elements of the song decide what the tonal center is, by accenting different notes.

The vocal melody is probably the most influential one, but there's also a faint little (counter-?) melody in the background for certain parts of the song.

In the intro and verse, the vocal melody reinforces the notes **F♯** and **A**, by ending phrases on these notes, respectively. The faint melody in the background (only really present in the intro and connecting sections) ends on **F♯**, **C♯**, **A** and **B**.

So, that little reinforcement tips the progression over into *F♯ minor/aeolian*.

The the bridge/pre-chorus arrives and the vocal melody starts to move around, accenting **D**, **F♯**, **A**, **G♯**, until it finally ends on a strong **B** ("...our cups to the  **stars**"). The tonal center gets more ambiguous.

Then the chorus kicks in and **D**, **C♯**, **B** end up being accented. *F♯* isn't even part of the melody anymore. The tonal center is morphing into **B** (which means *B dorian*).

The the second (more repetitive) part of the chorus hits and suddenly the melody is all about that **B**. The other two notes being used are *A* and *C♯*, which draws even more attention to the note between them (*B*).

Now we're in dorian territory. At least until the end of the chorus, then the small connecting section re-introduces the faint guitar melody from before that hints at *F♯*, then the next verse starts, the tonal center shifts back to *F♯* and the cycle continues.

---

At least, that's how I've always heard it. 

In the end, it probably depends on your cultural upbringing, the music you normally listen to and other factors that have nothing to do with the piece of music itself.

I don't make future bass but it's super common to use major 7th chords using supersaws which aren't continuously going but just accenting certain beats. The layout seems to be verse-build up-drop repeat with slight variations or adding a bridge. A well composed future bass song might have a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> too which will be ducked when the chords hit. Pads are common too. 

It's going to be harder to stand out using the major 7th supersaw but it's a key part of the future bass sound. 
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-03-12 07:35:13 jake0400<br>yes towards the end, a deeper <b><u>counter melody</u></b> could work nice, or maybe just some deep oohs if that makes sense

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-03-13 20:04:17 MagnesiaClub<br>If I understand you correctly you are trying to block out an orchestral piece using only a piano patch and are wondering how to get more distinct differences between the parts while they are being played by the same instrument?

In this situation I would use EQ. Taking the top end off a piano sound gives it a very woody (cinematic) feel probably use that for the main motif. Raising the EQ with a wide Q in the highs and high mids gives more presence, this would distinct enough from the woody tone to present an ‘alternate’ sound to the ear. I would probably use this for the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and depending on melodic range I would take down some of the lower frequencies where the woody piano is now playing. 

For an ostinato assuming it stays in the same octave I’d chop everything north and south of the sound leaving a pocketed probably quite eery tone. 

Three options. Hope that helps.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-03-15 00:58:15 Hitwelve<br>Thanks man! I appreciate it a lot. Everyone I've gotten feedback on has commented on the vocal mixing, I'm definitely gonna work on that in the future and try to learn how to mix vocals. 

I'm feeling the vibe from your beat, but it feels like it's missing something. Maybe that something is the vocals, not really sure, but it's feeling really wide open and like it's got a lot of space in it to me. It's a little repetitive too imo, but the idea is solid and the mixing is on point. Maybe some synth or strings chords or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is what I want in it?
</p></li><li><p><b>LinkinPark</b> 2018-03-15 03:48:16 appleappleappleman<br>This is a great start. The low-fi drums and piano vibe works really well for the intro and outro, and even the first verse, but you need to build on it afterwards to give the song some momentum so it doesn't stagnate. The main things you need are:

* **Some chords.** All of your instruments are playing only one note at a time, which works for the simple quiet parts, but when the chorus hits, it feels empty. If you're going for an electronic sound, play around with some pads. If you want to focus on the piano, add some right-hand chords. If you play guitar, throw in some chords that way. At the very least, beef up the choruses and bridge. 

* **Stronger drums.** Again, the beat works just fine in the verse. But the track would benefit from adding a layer of bigger, boomier drums in the choruses and bridge. It's about the momentum of the song. The beat/percussion should match the intensity of the melody and vocals.

* **Something to make the second verse different from the first.** This helps keep listeners engaged. You don't want to just repeat the whole time. You could add some quiet, high synth chords, or a counter-melody, or anything that you think works. Play around, put something fun in there. 

* **Velocity changes.** When you have those repeated piano notes in the chorus and bridge (the ones that just hit on every 8th note), it sounds very robotic when you have piano notes repeat at the exact same volume. Changing the MIDI note volume around (the "velocity") gives a much more authentic feel.

This is a great base track. Now just have some fun adding more stuff to it!

</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2018-03-17 01:45:42 hwqqlll<br>OP, I do half-sympathize with what you're saying. I too find that playing along to songs is better than practicing scales. Exercises have their place, but they're not music. To make music, you need to actually sit down and make music.

However...

&gt; theory can really get in the way of creativity

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.

Theory exists whether you're thinking about it or not. If something sounds good, it's because of the harmonic, rhythmic, etc. properties of the music. Theory is the way that we describe the properties of music; it's the way we talk about and explain why something sounds good.

Take [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35TAeugKpdY). It's a pretty basic 3-chord song. The transition into the pre-chorus ("where do you go when it gets dark...") sounds really cool and makes the song unique. Why is that? There's a specific way to describe what's happening there: the band plays the V chord while starting the melody on the same note as the previous lines (in this case, the 3rd scale degree, which is one of the chord tones earlier in the verse). Together with the V chord, it sounds like an add6 chord. Now, if you want to make something that sounds like that, you have it in the back of your mind; it's part of your musical vocabulary, so to speak.

Now, something like that is pretty simple, and it's easy enough to come across on your own if you're just fiddling with the guitar with no musical training. Now let's look at a song like [Someone Will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDBtFuWuzX4) by Dawes. There are two interesting things going on in the first verse. First of all, there's a counter-melody being played with the guitar arpeggios after each vocal line (going from F-G-A the first time and G-A-Bb the second time). Next, the melody changes on the third vocal line ("...and how they all seem to get the best of you...") in a way that sounds interesting and unique. Why? Because the chord in that line (A major) is a secondary dominant that resolves to Dm. There are theory terms to describe what's going on here. These are things that you won't necessarily find just noodling around. You *might* come up with the idea to play a non-diatonic major chord and resolve it to just the right chord, and you might just happen to play arpeggios that fit perfectly within the scale, but you probably won't, or it will at least take you a long time, and you won't know how to apply it in other circumstances.

Learning theory is basically learning to organize these principles and ideas. Sure, you can not learn theory and keep all these ideas about how music works as a jumbled mess in your mind. But why? That's an unreasonable handicap you're putting on yourself.

That said, I would suggest taking a different approach to learning theory. Don't look at theory on its own, as a set of exercises or rules in a book. Listen to music and figure out how to describe that music with theory. What scales are they using? Are they using dissonant chords? Is there chromaticism? How is tension resolved in the song? The more you know, the more musical vocabulary you have. When you hear something cool or soulful, you know why it's cool and soulful and you know how to incorporate it in your own music.

What would be your approach to keep the guitar on the side and the synth in the center, without compromising the synth's width?  :D
I'm working on a track struggling with that.
</p></li><li><p><b>AudioPost</b> 2018-03-23 06:19:18 BeaverStun<br>Have you ever shot ADR? The sync should always be straight-forward but it seldom is, and that's just using one source from the same actor, who's a professional (supposedly).

Getting one actor who's on-screen to mimic a non-actor from a phone recording that they're being fed from an earbud is likely going to need some finessing in editorial to sound in sync, let alone appear in sync visually, and sync is the most important thing that's going to sell both lines coming from one mouth.

What I mean by "weaving the mix" is that you're not going to just want to put up two tracks at unity and call it done. There will need to be some work EQing, compressing, distressing, even pitch shifting and riding faders on both tracks to get the optimal sound the way you think you want it.

Think of it as a duet. If a tenor and a soprano sing the same melody in perfect time with one another, the two individuals become a different sound. This is probably a close parallel to what you're envisioning. But the timbre of their own voices, or the breath force that they put into their voice is going to cause one to appear more forward in the mix, masking the other at times if the fader is at a singular level throughout. Then, the moment that one sings a counter-melody or plays with the rhythm differently than the another, suddenly you identify that there are two people singing.

By having a compromised (phone) and a clean recording (actor), you're going to have to work even more to achieve the balance that you want. By having one recorded after the fact, you're going to need an actor with either an impeccable ear for timing, or you'll need a bit of editing on the back end to pull it all into sync. Once they're "on the beat" so to speak, then you'll have to deal with whether the sonic result of the harmony is what you're looking for. Maybe the pitch of the interviewee's voice goes up a minor third at the end of the question and the actor's voice goes up a major third. Why does it sound weird? All of a sudden you've lost the sadness that the interviewee had. Are you going to pitch down the actor, pitch up the interviewee, or simply mix the interviewee a little hotter and duck the actor down to retain the emotion of the question without the tonal conflict? There will be hundreds of decisions to make even in a short.

This all falls under the consideration of "weaving the mix".

EQ-wise, my first starting point would probably be to clean the phone recording. What frequencies in the phone recording aren't helping you out? Is there a hum or line noise? Kill it. Is there a honkiness to the voice that's distracting? Reduce it. Make that track pleasant to listen to. Then find the predominant, intelligible frequencies in the phone recording and reduce those frequencies in the actor's track. Most phone recordings are band-limited from 200-4kHz with intelligibility living in the 1-4k range. Be precise, but don't notch filter. Probably no more than a Q of 7-12. Those offending frequencies that you reduced in the phone record? Give them a subtle boost in the actor with a wide, gentle Q.

Now, drop in another EQ and try to futz the actor's track to match the sound of the phone recording. Depending on the phone record, you might need a convolution reverb, or subtle distortion, or sample reduction (remember, phones are basically mid-quality mp3 encoder/decoders). This will either help to create a blended whole (in sync) or will sound like a mushy mess (out of sync) at a certain point you will have gone too far, identify what you did and back it off. How's that sound? Why do you think that? Work towards identifying why it doesn't work for you. Do you miss the fullness of the clean record? Change the slope of your high and low pass. Is the phone too pointed? Try a De-esser, or reduce with EQ and a broad Q of 1-2. Listen, tweak, repeat until you have what you want.

</p></li><li><p><b>Clarinet</b> 2018-03-31 04:52:07 cprenaissanceman<br>I tried to keep my list to things with important clarinet "tunes" (as OP asked for).  I did come across other passages that were mentioned as being "frequently asked for" in wind band auditions which I did not think exactly fit OP's request.  The Makris definitely falls in that category, but I welcome additions to my list (in an effort to make it more comprehensive and complete!)

Overall, I am kind of surprised that there is not a more standard list of clarinet excerpts for wind band.  Since there is a large amount of literature out there for wind band, it is surprising to me that so many auditions still ask for only (or primarily) orchestral excerpts.  Now, I do understand that doing this is prudent as it allows for players to demonstrate their abilities on a long tested set of standards and that it can allow for players who have (for whatever reason) never played in a wind band to demonstrate their skills with familiar repertoire.

Still, I think a wind band audition should have at least half of its excerpts come from the repertoire the player will be playing (i.e. at least half should be wind band pieces).  For one, many wind band pieces include styles that are rarely found in standard orchestral excerpts.  Jazz, marches, world music, pop/modern-genres inspired pieces: wind band players must be a lot more versatile than standard orchestral excerpts would suggest.  Also, playing in a wind band versus playing in a symphony are quite different activities.  In a section of 6+ (probably 9-12+ for most ensembles), you have a completely different role in the ensemble than the typical clarinet or even woodwind section of a orchestra.  Plus, you may have 3, 4, or 5+ clarinet parts which may be similar or may not be.  The typical hierarchy (i.e. 1st violins/clarinets have the melody and hardest parts, 2nd violins/clarinets have the harmony or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, etc.) may apply or it may not.  As such, it is not always as simple as giving your best players the first part and your worst the last.  Hell, I probably should have some 2nd and 3rd clarinet parts on the excerpt list (I really don't mean this to be rude, but I am just not familiar enough with these parts). Sometimes these parts are harder than the 1st or solo parts!

Finally, I think continuing to stand (only) by orchestral excerpts (for auditions) deprives wind band literature of the artistic and technical merit it deserves.  While I am not advocating for dumping all orchestral excerpts, I think wind band music ought to be elevated such that it is considered part of the standard repertoire that a musician should at least know about.  By using more wind band excerpts, we essentially say "this music represents a test of a top player's skill and musicality" and that it is a good measure for judging that player's abilities.  If we do this, I think we can get wind band players to recognize that there is a lot of interesting work going on in wind band composition and that it is not necessarily below orchestral composition in terms of its technical difficulty and artistic merit.  After that, hopefully we can get the public interested as well.  And perhaps sometime in the distant future, wind band excerpts will show up on orchestral auditions.

I tend to time shift the snare so when the snare and clap hit, it sounds more crisp, i also time shift and put 15-30 swing on the hi hats and kick, the hi hats make the beat feel fast so time shifting them will make a big difference, i roll kicks alot and putting swing on anything that rolls makes it more human, also time shifting the kick will make it so when the 808 and kick hit at the same time, they sound very distinct (this doesn't always work). a trick to making swing work for only a few instruments is clicking the wrench tool on the plugin and turning down the swing parameter. As for melodies i usually stay away from swing unless it is a flute or something of that type. The main melody is usually a chord progression so it always gets strum in the piano roll and i manually time shift the notes in the piano roll, never in the wrench tool tab. As for the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> i always turn up timeshift so it sticks out over the chord progression. That is about it...
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2018-04-02 04:31:11 matchbirnloof<br>A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> usually uses generally a different rhythm, so make sure its just not a copy rhythm wise, also make sure that the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> isnt dissonant on the beats. 

You are probably able to find more information theory wise when looking at baroque music.
</p></li><li><p><b>Unity3D</b> 2018-04-02 04:50:05 toinfiniityandbeyond<br>Thanks :) I'd be happy to share the process. 

Each phrase consists of 4 bars and so for each phrase a random starting note is chosen. Then a major chord is generated from this starting note, as well as a scale. Each bar has a 'root' note which is selected by using the chord generated earlier. So first bar uses the first note of the chord, second bar uses the next note, and so on; with the last bar going back to the first note of the chord. 

*  **Bass** - Plays the root note. Always plays on the first beat of a bar, other times are random.
*  **Arpeggio** - An arpeggio is generated each bar based off the root note. It is played in triplets every beat. Sometimes it randomly skips or goes up an octave.
*  **Melody** - This is the biggest con. It just randomly goes up the scale in random increments every beat sometimes skipping a beat or two. However, it does kind of sound like a pianist improvising.
*  **<b><u>Counter Melody</u></b>** - This plays a random note from the chord a few octaves higher. It randomly adds in embellishments and generally follows the melody. It is supposed to harmonise with the melody.

Generating chord and scales is actually very easy. I learned a lot from [this](http://teoria.com/en/tutorials/) website which is about general music theory. With a bit of practice I think great sounding procedural music is possible but this was just an experiment.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-04-03 07:47:54 unorthodoxbeatz<br>Not bad! I really liked how you added the snare midway through the intro. I also really liked how the melodies were dynamic.

You had some good ideas with the counter-melody, but the bass and overblown hats really drowned it out. I recommend finding a mixing tutorial on Youtube or this sub for trap music. Also I would recommend going over to r/drumkits and downloading some stuff that sounds interesting and sampling it, because whatever drumkits you are using now are either distorted beyond recognition or clipping like crazy.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-04-07 01:57:34 AndrewT81<br>In this case the melody is in the strings and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> uses a brass section sample for a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. 

Strings are very versatile, but the sound tends to be homogenous, so a lot of different colors in orchestral arrangements come from other instruments interacting with the strings. 

A common way to make a melody softer is to have it played by both strings and flute, or you can make it more adventurous by adding mallets like glockenspiel or vibraphone. 

A common arrangement in rpg soundtracks is to have bass guitar and simple percussion on the bottom, strings in the middle, and a solo instrument like trumpet on top. Some harp arpeggios can be added for that old school final fantasy feel. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-04-08 00:48:56 65TwinReverbRI<br>Form.

As u/tasker_morris said:

&gt;Music is linear. Composing is not.

The idea of starting at note 1, then writing note 2, or starting on measure 1, then writing measure 2, and so on is often a dead end.

I always use the analogy, most authors don't just sit down and type "It was a dark and stormy night..." then just keep on adding words until they have a novel.

Instead, they think about a plot line, then the characters, then the setting, any plot twists - is it a murder mystery or a romance, coming of age or reflections on life, a moral dilemma or slice of life, etc. All this is usually decided before they write word one.

And they make outlines, rough drafts, move things around, write, and re-write, and so on.

So one of the biggest problems I see with composers - and it's the common reason they can get 8 or 16 bars but then get stuck - is that they're thinking from the inside out, rather than the outside in.

What are you writing? Piano Solo. Great.

What kind of piece is is going to be - prelude-like, song-like, is it like a Nocturne, a Waltz, a Fantasy, an Album Leaf, a programmatic piece, etc.

What form is it going to be in? Binary? Ternary? Sonata-Form? Rondo? Through-Composed? Is it going to be Home - Store - Home, or is it going to be a Journey? Will material repeat, will ideas come back? Will they appear the same, or be modified? Is it a Theme and Variations? A Theme and Various Presentations?

How long will it be - a couple of minutes - 15 minutes?

What "mood" will it be? Lively, grave, bouncy, jazzy, poppy, etc.?

None of these have to be written in stone and can evolve as the piece evolves.

Then you can start working with your musical ideas - take your initial idea and make some variations of it. Try setting it as a melody against chords, then a melody against a counter-melody, then a melody against just a bass line that implies chords. Try different accompaniment patterns - I've written pieces where the main melody in 4/4 comes back in the end for a "maestoso" section in 3/4 (I was so proud of myself when I did that!).

There are so many possible variations and ways to set things - think of it like a character in a book - they can show up in different settings, different clothes, different positions, and even different ages.

I get the whole "this sounds like something else" thing - I have a real problem with that myself. A huge problem.

But one thing that can help is to just go ahead an use an idea you know is from somewhere else. Like if I were to write something like a "13 bar blues" (I have) I would not feel like I had to come up with some completely new chord progression - I'd just use a standard 12 bar form and add a measure. Because if I don't use the standard 12 bar, I'm not really writing a "based on 12 bar blues" piece.

And look, I'm sorry but you're already doing all stuff that's all been done before.

Piano solo? Yeah, that's really original. Yawn.

Chord progression? Yawn.

Chord progression that's not only sequential, but super common, yawn.

Minor scale? How original.

See - nothing you do is original, so don't get hung up on it - and don't fall into the trap of "I've got to come up with an original chord progression" or "I've got to use a scale no one else has ever used before" - that's silly and an exercise in futility.

It's OK to use the English Alphabet and English Language Vocabulary and Grammar to write your novel.

That's a moot issue - it's a non issue. It is what it is. You're going to use pitch, timbre, and volume, and melody, harmony, and rhythm (to simplify).

Coming up with gobbledygook words and Yoda Speak for your novel, or writing it in some new Alien language isn't going to make it "original" (at least in any meritorious way besides singularity) or even good.

But put your character John Smith into a though-provoking situation and develop that character throughout the story - that's where the goods are.

Your chord progression and melody is just a character in a setting.

Now, what do you want them to do? Go exploring? Sit on the porch in a rocking chair watching the world go by? Engage in self reflection?

It's up to you, but you need to make some "big decisions" as Bob Ross says and think about how you want this musical material to "live" within the piece.

The buildup that starts at 2:00 (this is just my opinion) but I felt like some of the energy was lost. You brought the majority of the elements to the back which I thought was a good choice. So if you wanted to continue with that path starting that riser a bit earlier or add some closer/stereo sfx elements for distance contrast and to build tension.

</p></li><li><p><b>WritingPrompts</b> 2018-04-11 04:10:53 JohannesVerne<br>I ran my eyes over the paperwork again. Two bedroom, one and a half bath, one car attached garage, total floor space at just under a thousand square feet... The funny thing is, I can remember when I bought the house that there were two bedrooms. Only when I focus on it though, if I let it slip back into my memory I completely forget, and it's harder to recall each time.

&amp;nbsp;

As a young bachelor, I didn't really need a second room, but I wanted it for a music room, and I had put my guitar in there when I was moving in. I can barely even remember that guitar, I had to buy another because I thought it must have been lost in the move, but sometimes I feel like I can hear it being played, almost, at the edge of my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

I never would have thought anything about it, but the lease papers in front of me clearly state that my house has two bedrooms, even though I know for a fact that there is only one. Maybe it's a typo? Surely I would have caught it when I first viewed the house, but apparently neither I nor the realtor noticed. I probably shouldn't sign until I get it cleared up, maybe they listed the wrong house on the renewal papers. I feel the whispers of a melody tugging at the back of my mind, and cant focus on the papers now anyways.

&amp;nbsp;

Soon enough, My guitar is in my hands, and I'm strumming out a harmony to the song floating through my head. It's an old beat up acoustic that I bought when my old one got misplaced by the movers, but the sounds that it plays... It's something more beautiful than I can describe. I know it didn't sound that good in the store, but I'm not complaining. Raw emotion and longing fill the room as the last chords hang in the air. I've never been what most people would call emotional, but music does that to me sometimes, makes me feel like there is something, something more to life, and all I have to do is close my eyes and everything is perfect.

&amp;nbsp;

In the morning I get up like usual, to the sound of my buzzing alarm, and barely drag myself out of bed. I don't remember prepping my coffee maker last night, but apparently I did. The smell as it brews at least starts to wake me up, at least until I see the mail I left on the table last night. The rent needs paid, and I guess I forgot to sign the lease renewal form, so I whip a quick signature to it. I can't find any envelopes, so I toss it back on the table while I search.

&amp;nbsp;

"Where are those stupid envelopes!" I've been in the habit of talking to myself for as long as I can remember, And while it makes for a one sided conversation it helps jog my memory sometimes. Sure enough, as soon as I say it out loud, I remember setting them on the shelf by the door. A nice out of the way place where I should easily remember, so of course I forget where they are.

&amp;nbsp;

I almost forget my coffee too, as I head out for work. I barely remember as I step out the door, and I rush back in to grab it. Then it's back out the door and off to another boring day at the office. Still, IT for a small shop is better than retail. The pay is better at least, and it's what I went to school for. I'm still not looking forward to it, and I think the stress is getting to me. I have a hard time focusing at home, and my memory feels like it has holes in it, like things are there and I just cant remember them even when it's right in front of me.

&amp;nbsp;

When I finally get home I just want to relax, but I need to make dinner. The song running through my head isn't helping; it feels like a variation of what I was playing last night, and I just want to grab my guitar and play along. I try to rush through cooking some boxed pasta mix. I didn't even bother looking at what flavor I grabbed, I just threw it on the stove once the water started boiling. I didn't remember setting the timer either, but it beeped at me anyways, so hopefully I set it for the right amount of time. I don't remember looking at the box to check.

&amp;nbsp;

The food was probably too hot to eat yet, but i ate anyways. I think I may be going crazy, all I can focus on is the music.

&amp;nbsp;

"What is wrong with me? I feel like I'm missing something..."

&amp;nbsp;

"You're fine, just play the song."

&amp;nbsp;

"I just need to play, maybe I can focus then."

&amp;nbsp;

My fingers glide across the strings, and a counter-melody rings though my mind, almost real, like a distant memory. Everything seems to slow down, I can finally relax. My eyes close, and I let the music sweep over me.

&amp;nbsp;

"I feel so close, to something... Like something I lost a long time ago..."

&amp;nbsp;

"Open your eyes, I'm right here... Please..."

&amp;nbsp;

It was like echoes of an echo, something that was real but wasn't there. I saw a memory of a girl I knew, or thought I did. My eyes opened, and the memory faded.

&amp;nbsp;

"Maybe I really am going crazy..."

&amp;nbsp;

I dropped the guitar and went back to the kitchen. I still needed to put away the leftovers, and pack some up for tomorrow's lunch. Except that everything was put away already. I looked in the fridge and sure enough, the pasta was in a container for lunch tomorrow, and I could have sworn there was a note on it. I went over to my coffee maker, and it was already prepped for tomorrow morning. I know for a fact that I didn't do that. The note in the fridge, I had to get to it before I forgot about it. Well, forgot again.

&amp;nbsp;

It was there. A note. One that I didn't write.

&amp;nbsp;

"I Love you, Alex. Please, remember me." 
signed "Your little sister, Emily"

&amp;nbsp;

Sister? I would know if I had a sister, like the one that got mixed up with some weird kids playing at witchcraft back in school, but they did something, and it killed her. 

&amp;nbsp;

"That cant be right."

&amp;nbsp;

I would remember if I had a sister, if she had been killed. The details had always been hazy, the police weren't sure what happened. No body was ever found, and things drifted off from there...

&amp;nbsp;

I heard crying. It wasn't me, either. At least, I don't think it was. I tried following it, to the door in the middle of the hall. Had that door always been there? I can't remember. I can't even remember what it is that I am trying to remember. I open the door quietly, and there she is, holding my old guitar, sobbing her eyes out.

&amp;nbsp;

"Emmy?"

&amp;nbsp;

Her head whipped around, and she looked as surprised as I felt. The next thing I remember is her arms wrapped around me, head in my shoulder, with tears pouring out. 

&amp;nbsp;

"You remembered me!"

&amp;nbsp;

"I don't know how I forgot, I think I'm going crazy. What's happening to me?"

&amp;nbsp;

"I was cursed," she said, and I could barely make it out with her face pressed into my shoulder. "The other kids were just playing at it, but I found out how to be a real witch. I just didn't know what would happen."

&amp;nbsp;

"What are you talking about? A witch? You?"

&amp;nbsp;

"Everyone forgot me. They couldn't see me, or hear me, or notice anything about me. I can still do things, but nobody notices me. I thought you might... You always liked music, and you taught me to play..."

&amp;nbsp;

The memories flooded back, me teasing little Emily for playing the wrong chord, her teasing back that I was a bad teacher. Memory after memory hit me, her sitting up with me playing guitar, late at night, when I thought I was alone. Helping me, filling in my one sided conversations. I was never really talking to myself.

&amp;nbsp;

"Please don't let go, I don't want you to forget. I don't want to be alone again."

&amp;nbsp;


"Don't worry Emmy, We'll find a way to fix this. I remember you. You aren't alone anymore."

&amp;nbsp;

LOL the Curtiss King tag. I think the beat the ambience in the beat is cool. Im not sure I like the pitched down clap. I think the beat could use some more multiband compression to bring the whole mix solidly together, it feels a little loose and not fully present. I would introduce a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or move the high hats up to lead the track forward, keep it from being stagnant to the listener. Good work.
</p></li><li><p><b>notesandchords</b> 2018-04-24 00:59:40 Lofse<br>This is p nice. 

The highlight for me would be the interesting melody cuz you didn't do the most obvious notes all the time. 

On the other side of things i think it gets a bit harsh at times, esp when those vocal chops come in around 1:05 it gets pretty ear rapey. 

The other thing that stood out to me negatively was the supersaw, its so reverbed out and far, no punch or warmth in it, it kinda works when the arp/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> and the vocal chops come in but when its just drums, melody and chords i would really like some more presence from those chords.

I've been saying the exact same thing this whole time! You can really hear it in the instrumentals. Take for example [Knock Knock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VWT8aaOlA&amp;t=40s). You can really hear the sort of wistful nature it brought with the guitar and those bells in the chorus with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Even when I listened to it for the first time, I felt nostalgic for... something. The chord progressions are never the most complicated but it's more the instrumental choices that . Another example: the bridge of [Likey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Ce5FuUZkk&amp;t=2m25s)

&gt; I don't know JYPE, but do you have any ideas as to why they keep this concept? Besides it working out.

Well, I mean it's gotta be that right? If it's consistently working, there's no reason to change it. If you look at Wonder Girls for example, when JYP sent them to the US, it didn't exactly go so well. I'm thinking they've learned their lesson in trying to switch things up when they're already successful.

You should read [this article](https://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/21904618.html) by a JYPE Japan Director on their Japanese promotions. They know their target demographic very well, and the way JYPE's handled them is actually a master class in marketing.

The only thing I might suggest is adding a countermelody to the chime/xylophones during the second loop of the chime chorus.  I hope that makes sense, what I mean is essentially throw in some counter-melody arpeggios to help keep the beat fresh in the second half.

Like, if you have a DM chord progression, throw in a countermelody of like Fm or Am (diminished 3rd, diminished 5th)
</p></li><li><p><b>AskReddit</b> 2018-04-26 04:13:40 wannabesq<br>IMO it's the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that makes the piece perfect.  Too many composers skimp out on decent counter melodies, but I think they add so much depth.  It's one reason why I think John Williams is so popular, cause everything he does has counter melodies.  
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-04-26 11:01:37 littledragon306<br>It’s dope, wouldn’t mind spitting something on that tbh. One thing I would say is the main loop could use a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and the drum transition at 00:00:20 is a little rough but not too bad. Real nice samples.
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2018-04-26 20:49:46 Kyuuga<br>I mean, there's Royal Blood who technically does that in a lot of songs \(check out Out of The Black for instance\).

But honestly the bass doubling a guitar solo can be weird for many reasons. For one, usually the solo is played in a higher register which the bass has no acess to \(unless you play the lower notes OR you have a 6/7 string bass\). And it'd just sound...weird, maybe? It'd leave the music empty.

Now, on the other hand, the bass playing counter\-melodies while the guitar solos is a whole other thing. And there's plenty of examples of that. One I'd recommend is "Scar Tissue" by Red Hot Chili Peppers. Flea plays a beautiful counter\-melody during Frusciante's mini\-solos and it's a great example of that.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-04-27 17:25:03 caterix<br>Thanks guys, lots of great insight here. The thing I'm still unclear about is hearing what is written. Here's an example process:

1) Write a four bar melody for the flute.
2) Have the horn play a counter-melody or harmony notes.

At this point, I could play these two lines on the piano simultaneously to make sure it adds up to what I imagined.

3) I then add some notes for the oboe, then something by the bassoon, low in its register.

At this point, especially if the ranges are the instuments are quite far apart, it might become impractical to try to play the phrase on the piano. Inputting everything into Sibelius to hear how the lines interact is an idea, but there must be other ways it is traditionally done!

Acreator1 - when you write your 6 staves for an orchestral piece, how do you hear that interaction? The missing link in my understanding is how you can hear the result of your 6 staves of writing without using midi playback? With that being said, you did say you do use Sibelius playback.. so how was this done before computers?


</p></li><li><p><b>AskReddit</b> 2018-04-28 05:51:19 aDuggie<br>You can think of it as playing two parts of the same rhythm. The left hand usually keeps a steady beat or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> sych as a base drum, while the right plays the main rhythm complimented by the beat.

But I feel like I kept expecting a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to pop up as the beat went on, but it just kept riding the flanged bells. I'd think about something to break up the melody (even if it's just a pause or chop at the end of a 4-8 bar section. Maybe a similar change up with the snare. Overall different, I dig it. 
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-04-30 02:30:45 lawnchairsthelazy<br>Seems like you should try experimenting with your sounds. Try something different and see if it sounds bad. Try to figure out why you think it sounds bad. Maybe you want to add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Try working in different octaves. All my stuff is terrible, but if I only made what sounded just alright, I would just keep on making the same stuff. 
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-04-30 06:32:53 Blaze_Beats<br>From reading the previous comments and also a few of my own suggestions
1. That piano is kinda plain and could definitely use something, like layering, a new sound entirely and/or some fun effects like a reverb. maybe some delay(I also personally like to lowpass pianos for that underwater sound), get spicey with it
2. The beat doesn't have much depth and feels kinda empty and flat. Try to add a melody and possibly also a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Along with this you could also layer the piano like I said earlier. An arp could also be nice. Finally the major thing to help is to use stereo, not everything needs to be centered. I usually use nexus for my leads/melodies, so I always turn the spread knob up a little. Also you could add more percussive elements and pan them to opposite sides to keep the track balanced.
3. The percussion could use some work. One issue I had with the beat is that the snare was not consistent. I always like to leave a snare in and keep it consistent, because it it allows you to bob your head to it. You could add some more swag to the snare by adding a shorter, punchy snare in between to add some bounce. I also like to use open hats, toms, tambs, or just random sfx to fill up empty/boring/repetitive space in my rhythms

[“And I wear the same face as well…”](https://imgur.com/M9fHut6) It's funny, Nunnally is the only one of Charles's kids that actually resembles him. 

"I wanted to use it to cure her blindness." I never thought about this but I guess it would have worked. Is there a fanfiction of this or something? I really want to see how that would have played out

["No, I have to take responsibility for starting this"](https://imgur.com/ugi9dIX) Callback to Zero telling Tohdoh he has to take responsibility for the miracle he created?

["Are you saying we would have been better off to remain in hiding? Did you want a future of living in constant fear of assassination? This was for your future too, Nunnally"](https://imgur.com/n9MuVp4) I think Lelouch idealized Nunnally so much he never really knew her. Creating a better future? Nunnally never wanted that. That was Lelouch's dream, not hers. Stop using your sister as justification for your own actions Lulu.

Kallen and Suzaku still fighting about the system even after everything that's changed. They each respect each other so much on the battlefield despite everything that happened off it.

I love how that speech fits so well together but also into individual character arcs. Xingke fought to protect his country and empress. Cornelia fought out of duty and dignity. Villetta wanted to belong somewhere. Ohgi was vicariously fulfilling a dead friend's dream. Rakshata wanted to invent. Even Tamaki just wanted respect. And Lelouch and Nunnally? They both wanted to move into the future.

&gt;Cecile: It's through repeated successes and failures that we advance. That not only goes for science, but people as well.
&gt;Lloyd: But that's evolution.
&gt;Rakshata: You mean progress, don't you, Earl of Pudding?
Compare [Charles's speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du2mLuK9edk) from the beginning of the series. 

[Lelouch finally gets it.](https://imgur.com/uT8uZaL) Nunnally isn't the perfect angel he wanted to see. She was putting on a mask for him just as he was for her. They really are more alike than Lelouch would like to admit. I think this is the first time he really understands her. Ironic he starts respecting her by taking her willpower. But I think in that moment, he just sees a reflection of himself. 

God I wish I could take off my contacts like Lelouch. 

[This is so ridiculous.](https://imgur.com/H6pmFby)

[wtf Schneizel stairs why](https://imgur.com/lDU1SGp)

[The music. The voice acting. Amazing.](https://imgur.com/qAT1Qfo) Also, anyone notice how Lelouch's accent changes over the series? He sounds much rougher as Lelouch Lamperouge than as Lelouch vi Britannia. Like even compare how he sounds speaking to Kallen on the student council in R1 with him speaking to Suzaku. He sounds so much more posh with Suzaku. Mad respect for Johnny Yong Bosch.

[I love Milly and Rivalz.](https://imgur.com/uOQNlAg) They might be one of my favorite parts of the show. They don't do much but they add so much humanity. Like, imagine what Rivalz is feeling right now. Last time he saw his best friend they were talking about setting off fireworks and now he controls the world.

[This map bothers me so much.](https://imgur.com/eo9enlo) Indonesia and the Philippines are off.

"Imperial Crown Colony of Japan" I guess he kept his promise. He did give them Japan.

You can see even here he was preparing for Japanese independence by getting rid of the name Area 11. I've seen a lot of people say Zero Requiem would fail because of the power vacuum left behind but Lelouch had literally months of absolute authority to sort all the kinks out. He's got Schneizel and he has complete access to every political leader. He can geass them into honesty, if they won't strive for world peace after he's gone, he can kill them. And he has complete access to the media too. He doesn't even need to create a bloodbath to wipe Euphemia's memory clean. He just needs to fake one. And his reign was so short no one would suspect anything when all his political prisoners end up being unharmed after his Red Terror.

lol Lelouch has almost as many titles as Daenerys Targaryen. ^(but Lelouch actually earned his(sorry Daenerys I love you too) Actually, purple-eyed exile royalty bent on liberation? They have a lot in common actually.

[This gave me chills when I first saw it.](https://imgur.com/N9qckbA)
Also, this is the first time Nunnally can see what Zero looks like. Wonder what she thinks of her brother's choice of outfits.

[I think Lelouch is genuinely terrified here.](https://imgur.com/TUnQSmV) It's what makes his death so hard. He's not Suzaku. He doesn't want to die. He cares too much to be suicidal. Sure there were a few times in the series he fell pretty hard but not now. He'd found his purpose and cares too much about the world, its people, and its future to not want to see it.

[Aw C.C. believes in something. She’s finally living.](https://imgur.com/fE8dThD)

[This music. The violin <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is just fantastic.](https://imgur.com/jgVPvd1)

[The only ones who should kill are those prepared to be killed.](https://imgur.com/rjXIRjC) Lelouch, you are many things but you are not a hypocrite or a coward.

[Nunnally's screams are absolutely heartbreaking](https://imgur.com/krWTpLv)

[The juxtaposition of the almost cheerful music, the chanting, and the anguished screams hits hard. Also, cross/crucifix symbolism](https://imgur.com/Z4ujFvA)

For a show that never stops to breathe the finale tied off all its character arcs perfectly. Suzaku got his atonement. C.C. stopped simply accumulating experiences. Kallen got accepted as Japanese. And Lelouch made the world a better place. 

Overall, one of the best finales to anything ever. There is a reason Lelouch is almost universally loved.

The part at 0:38 in Ants of the Sky has the guitars playing the same thing 4 times.  The drums play the same thing twice (snare on every downbeat), the third he hints at the syncopation that is coming fourth time with the bass (the snare hits are not on every downbeat), then the fourth time we have that syncopated part with the bass that is counter to what the guitars are playing (and have been playing the whole time).  This branching off thing is one of my favorite things that they do.

My favorite example of this is at 4:09 in Sun of Nothing.  Both guitars and bass play the same thing twice; the third time the bass plays a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, one guitar keeps playing the original riff, and the other guitar plays in harmony with the original riff; the fourth time the guitars still play the riff and harmony, while the bass plays a fucking solo over the whole thing (side note: I'm a bassist, so I'm contractually obligated to love this part).
</p></li><li><p><b>TameImpala</b> 2018-05-03 08:53:42 Hershiekopper<br>(1) Listen to artists that Kevin listens to --&gt; you will be sourcing inspiration from the same sources he got his from
(2) Learn a bunch of classic melodic basslines (I'd say focus on Beatles --&gt; White album, Mystery tour and Sgt Peppers are key)
(3) Guitar chords dont have to be crazy but use them as the scaffolding for your melodic bassline --&gt; Bassline is what drives the song and make sure its something u urself get caught humming i.e. catchy
(4) use the drums solely to solidify the groove (at a minimum)
(5) use synths to either add pads to support the guitar chords or as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the bassline 
(6) If it doesnt turn into something you are craving to listen to yourself (e.g. walking to class and finding yourself craving to listen to your song on the way to class) then its obviously a shit song and you need to re-evaluate and either change some shit or start fresh. But you need to be wanting to listen to your song (Think of it as you making something that you wished kevin made to fill a musical craving of yours). 
(7) dont listen to everyone saying "dont copy tame impala, make your own thing" The first step to originality is copying, in my opinion.
My Band's first EP was me trying to create songs I wish I heard and I drew a ton of inspiration from Tame impala. It wasn't completely original but It pushed me to start furthering my sound from the tame impala sound and solidified my basis for songwriting. Think about this "copying" of Kevin as copying a tried and true method of psychedelic rock song writing. You need to perfect the human form before you can mess with it. and I definitely think that using Tame impala as a basis to reference your songs allows you to gauge where your songwriting/composition is at and once its at the point where you feel like you are craving to hear your songs as much as or even more than Kevin's songs then you should start finding your own sound! (Cause you have the foundation set). 
(8) Finally, BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF!!! meaning, be honest when your song is shit and be honest when you think its good. If you yourself are not craving listening to your song than you know its a piece of crap. This is the key to improvement

You've got the tuba provided the oopahs (the bass guitar in most modern music), and you've got the trumpets playing a melody line (guitar). In between, doing a little of both, you've got your trombones.

Thinking of it this way really changed what I used it for compositionally. Choosing to accent rhythms or provide <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or all the other things you might use trombones for really opened up my mind from a "play chords, leads, or bass lines" mentality.

If you want to make it slightly less repetitive, add another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that fits the track for the chorus, or lowpass the entire beat in sections\(I know that's not an obvious NY thing, but Joey Bada$$ been doing that in some of his beats\). I'm not the biggest fan of the hi hats, too distorted and low pitched for me\(assuming you did parallel compression on the drums as this is a NY beat\). 

Its a pretty good beat though, with the repetitive point as well, when people rap on it they don't care about the repetitiveness.

CPE theory rules are for theory classes and analysis mostly and once you learn the rules you can use them.. but nearly any pop tune you hear today throws Parallel 5th rules out the window and plenty of writing after the classical era of music moved away from CPE lets not talk about quartal harmonies and bitonality.  I feel like from a theorists point of view this comment could be helpful and if it were a CPE piece of sorts.. but as it exists it could be nice played out.. I would say try and use 3 part voice writing to add texture and color to your chords and find ways to make the lower voices more interesting. Try adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and flushing out the main melody a bit more? maybe add some fugal bits to really spice it up. I think it is an interesting start. If you find that you really want to abide by CPE rules and the stuff you learn in theory class then go for it as well cant go wrong with CPE stuff.. but even the guys that were composing in the CPE werent really thinking about how to follow the CPE rules we just made them to understand music better. You think Bach was sitting around composing the Clavier saying to himself "gosh darn I could finish this key but this dang parallel fifth keeps screwing up the voice leading"

The Guardian - 

- Production is pretty nice, some of the sample libraries could do with upgrading, but that's something that comes with money and time. 
- Maybe pop a little more reverb on some of the melodies just to get them sounding a little more fluid.
- The writing is solid, compositionally this is pretty nice, definitely up to scratch of some library music.
- I 100% had tracks worse than this signed in my early days, so i'd say this track is ready to at least send to some libraries to see if you can get it signed. Not everywhere will accept it, but some should do. 

Son Of War 
- The expression of the strings is a little sloppy at the start, try and get it a bit smoother. 
- melody and harmony is pretty solid, a little repeated, but it's decent for some early library work for sure. 
- Though its fine for a few tracks, i wouldn't rely on the step up key change on every track. It can get a little tiring, and it can be hard for editors to make smaller edits of your track. 
- The ending of this track is a little messy, it just seems to sort of stumble into that last note, maybe get the harmonic tension up a bit with some dissonance before that note


Both of these tracks are really good starting points, and i'd 100% start to think about sending these to libraries. You may not get everyone wanting it, and may get some feedback notes, but it's a start for sure. 

As a bit of structure advice, a bit of a standard structure for trailer tracks is a 3 minute piece split into 3 sections.

- Section 1 is the quiet intro. Introduce us to ideas of the main melody, keep it sparse, and slowly build instrumentation. 

- Section 2 is a building section, growing tension, get some 'hit points' in here, and introduce a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> maybe. 

- Section 3 is the release.. everything comes back at it's fullest, loudest and most epic. i'm talking percussion, choirs, risers, spicatto strings, huge french horn melodies. Build this to one final Sting ending (one note that is a definite ending)

That structure helps a lot of editors when using trailers, especially for TV use, which is what you'll get initially probably. It's not a fool proof plan, and don't stick to it all the time 100%, but it's a good guide to getting tracks placed. 

keep practicing and get that production value up, watch youtube vids, get new plugins, sample libraries.. and you'll be killing it soon!

G'luck!

I got less mileage out of the sound redesign vs. what I wanted, because I realized the mix/composition changes a ton when you start with thinner sounds. I.e. you might have a lead, counter\-melody, a hook in the arrangement, a pad, and bass \-\- then you redo one of those sounds with diva or p900 and you won't have room for all the others.

I love the P900, currently my go\-to, though it played a limited role in the sound redesign.  I want to add some real hardware, and modular is my favorite but also the most cost\-prohibitive \(what's holding me back from that right now\). Outside of that friends are pressuring me toward either the Behringer cheaper almost\-as\-good path, or DSA OB\-6 path.

It seems like everything you have in there fits together very well and all of the sounds compliment each other very well.  Maybe for the second drop change up the notes of the lead? Or just add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with them so it gives it that "second drop intensity".  I feel like chopping the volume and using it as fills (like a stop-go vibe) could really benefit you as well, but that's just a suggestion.  The buildup could definitely use a bit of work, maybe a rising sub and high-passed drums.  During the bridge, maybe cut the drums a tad so that they aren't as hard as those in the drop - it makes the drop sound much more special.  Also, that riser you use.. I've been looking for it for sooo long but can't seem to find it :-(

Great work!
</p></li><li><p><b>tipofmytongue</b> 2018-05-17 21:02:52 ShiggieSmalls<br>Are you talking about a counter-melody?
</p></li><li><p><b>TheRedditSymphony</b> 2018-05-18 05:38:38 CasuallyNothing<br>Alright, let's get started:

In all honesty, I almost stopped reading your post when you said, 

&gt; "Even if the community gets their crap together and chooses the song that objectively sounds the coolest..."

Objectively sounds the coolest? How can something objectively sound cool? What chord progression, what counter-melody, what dynamics make something undeniably and indisputably sound cool? With how well thought out your post is, I don't think you worded it as such by accident.

&amp;nbsp;

Another thing you mentioned was a composer being **_commissioned._**  This would be entirely for fun, there will be **no commission** and **no incentive** other than recognition. If you think that composers would find this a complete waste of time, ask them how many compositions they've written in their free time, no expectation to be shown to the light of day. If they only ever wrote pieces on commission, they would never make it as a composer. We're **not** going to require every composer to submit a work history and three professional references and do background checks on everyone, that's ridiculous. 

&amp;nbsp;

Will there be a judging panel? Most likely to make a 'top 10' or similar. Is it going to be a popularity contest? Doubt it. Are people going to vote for the song that **_they think_** sounds the coolest? Probably. That's the whole point. We want the community, the ones who would be playing the piece, to think it's interesting and _want_ to play it.

&amp;nbsp;

As for songs being boring for musicians to play, trust me I've played a fair share of whole notes in my time. It's not always about having the fun parts or a solo. It's about being part of the band, being part of something bigger and being able to hear it all come together. THAT'S why _I_ play, but I won't speak for everyone.

&amp;nbsp;

So just remember, this entire project is for fun.
</p></li><li><p><b>Tabs</b> 2018-05-18 15:51:34 Geromusic<br>Fun little tune!  Here's my arrangement for guitar.  

h=hammer-on  
p=pull-off  

Standard tuning.  I assume you know how the song goes, so I'll tab each section once and then it just repeats.  Whenever possible fret the whole chord and just pluck the strings you need.  

Dbm  9-11-11-9-9-9  
Gbm  X-9-11-11-10-9  
Ab7  X-11-10-11-9-X  

It starts on a Dbm chord with a root-fourth-fifth bass line accenting 1 and 3 the rest of the chord on 2 and 4.    

      Dbm  
    |------9-----------9----|  
    |------9-----------9----|  
    |------9-----------9----|  
    |------11----------11---|  
    |------11---9h11---11---|  
    |--9--------------------|  
This is played 3x for the intro, then each verse is the above pattern 4x, with the 4th time instead of doing the bass line thing he just strums the whole chord on quarter notes.  

At 0:16 for the "chorus" it moves to Gbm, then back to Ddm with a little counter-melody on the thin strings, followed Ab7:  


       Gbm                 Dbm                Ab7                    Dbm
    |----------9-------------------9---------------------------------------9-----------9----|  
    |------10-----10------------9-----9-------------9---------9------------9-----------9----|  
    |------11-------------------9-------------------11--------11-----------9-----------9----|  
    |------11-------------------11------------------10--------10-----------11----------11---|  
    |--9---------------------------------------11---------11---------------11---9h11---11---|  
    |----------------------11-----------------------------------------11--------------------|  

After each chorus there's an extra measure of the Dbm pattern setting up the next verse.  


That's pretty much it.  It's just verse-chorus six times with two choruses in a row the last time, then the verse riff fades out for an outro.  


In the last chorus on the Dbm chord at 1:56 he does a different fill:  

    |-----------12p9--|  
    |------9----------|  
    |------9----------|  
    |------11---------|  
    |-----------------|  
    |--9--------------|  

There's a couple other little fills I skipped, but they're very similar to what I did above and it should be easy enough to figure out using this as as starting point.  

Have fun!

 Maybe the second part of the chorus could use some change. Maybe some extra pad or synth bass would sound good.

 If you got some female vocals to do some counter-melody on the chorus that would sound so epic, but that's a big IF.

&gt; I just played it the way Busoni would've played it if he ... altered Liszt's version

So, [Busoni and Liszt both independently have a lot of Bach transcriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transcriptions_of_compositions_by_Johann_Sebastian_Bach), but we have no example of Busoni "altering" Liszt's versions of Bach.

Let's look at Liszt first. Liszt did transcribe a lot of organ music for piano. He also transcribed some choral stuff but I've never heard it.

* [Liszt F&amp;F in g minor BWV 542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXkCY0HUadg) - the transcription is nearly identical to the organ music. The pedal is treated as left hand octaves, and the organ manuals are cleverly distributed between the two hands as well. This is not a particularly successful transcription, in part because the (first movement) fantasy relies so much on the harsh, suspended Long Note sonorities only an organ has. [Take this passage on the piano](https://youtu.be/dXkCY0HUadg?t=189). The left hand has to keep striking bass notes because they die on the piano, creating a plodding "beat". The organ however, can just sit on the notes, and [the whole passage on organ](https://youtu.be/7qHWdlkgosQ?t=117) slowly creeps up chromatically, building tension and harsh intervals much more effectively. An unfortunate by-product of Liszt's transcription technique is that most pianists play the bass just crushingly loud the entire time, because, well, when all you have is octaves, you can't help but hammer them.

* [Liszt's P&amp;F a minor transcription](https://youtu.be/FboiWpTRTDI?t=291) is a pretty good transcription but again here's the octaves in the left hand which results in pretty heavy writing.

Now I'm not saying Busoni didn't do the pedal=left-hand-octaves thing, but I do think Liszt phoned it in with his transcriptions and it's clear he just wanted to play organ music on the piano, because he always resorts to the same thing. Busoni went beyond that. Busoni has the rare honor of putting Liszt in second place, as far as technique goes. While Liszt typically transcribed organ music to be merely playable on the piano, Busoni basically composed something new from Bach's music: he took the music to piano, added harmony and counterpoint (no small feat on top of Bach's music), and in most cases elaborated the music to fit a virtuosic pianistic idiom. Busoni also drew from a wider variety of Bach's music and transcribed to and from other things than just piano/organ. For example he transcribed the Chromatic fantasy and fugue (originally for keyboard) to, somehow, cello and piano. 

The most impressive and exciting is the transcription from the Violin chaconne to the piano. Saying this is a transcription from violin to piano is like saying "China has a lot of people". This is a radically new piece with exciting, demanding textures and techniques that push the pianist hard. Organ transcription to piano presents one type of challenge, that is putting three staffs of the organ (foot-hand-hand) to two staffs on piano (hand-hand). Violin transcription presents a harder challenge, that is putting one staff of the violin to the two staffs on piano. Why should that be harder? Rather than choosing what to omit and squeeze to fit 3 on 2, you have to *add* and actively expand the implied harmony to fill the space. But enough of me, let the music speak for itself.

* [Busoni's chaconne](https://youtu.be/Fu-9frVpssg?t=219) introduces breathtaking runs that are surely present in the original, but the compass of the piano both allows and demands brilliant runs like this, on *both* hands. Compare to [the original on violin](https://youtu.be/5bVRTtcWmXI?t=253). Sure, the runs are there and exciting, but you have to admit that Busoni took something large on the violin, and made it HUGE on the piano. You may protest he merely embellishes Bach original runs. Sure, but throughout the rest of the "first movement" of the Chaconne, there are instances of his elaborate texture, a falling chromatic run where there can be none on the violin, a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> here and there. 

* Honorable mention goes to [the cadenza in Busoni's piano transcription of Concerto for two harpsichords BWV 1052](https://youtu.be/tFxskSWto5I?t=244), which burns my eyebrows clean off. Amazing.

Busoni is indeed known to have transcribed *Liszt's transcriptions*, but for other music: [Busoni adapted Liszt's adaptation of Paganini, in La Campanella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aLKPtF6uc). This example is interesting because it shows that Busoni did not always believe transcription means "more notes" It is not more stunningly virtuosic, it is just different. (If you want the virtuosic-on-virtuosic, [Hamelin's Etude on La Campenella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-E921umnRw) fits that bill, and how!) But in any case. It is clear whatever is played in this clip resembles neither Liszt's heavy-handedness, Busoni's virtuosic work, nor tasteful music.

Some people have different opinions on how to handle it. A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> if you will. Get over it.  Oh, and you'll read the book and end up with the same conclusion everyone else does a few weeks/months after reading it when they acknowledge that it's just semantics and some behaviors (bravery/cowardice) exist on a spectrum inherent in many species that exist outside a societal structure.

The thing about the album version that I like so much is the dark mood of the verses and of course the incredibly uplifting chorus 

Cobain wrote some amazing melodies but I do think Lithium is his best one. The way the guitar riff intertwined with the verse phrase is such a beautiful melody topped off with that genius bass <b><u>counter melody</u></b> 

When you hear piano renditions of this song, the brilliant melodies of this tunes stands out most imo and is a testament to how great Nirvana songs are in general. 


I prefer the album version most because it was recorded in D which lends to that darker feel. However it sounds massive at the Live and Loud show in E Flat as well

Make a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and play it over your main melody whenever you like.

Make varied drum sounds, for example switch up the hi-hats/snares every now and again to keep it interesting. 

Transition into just having your main melody play in the middle of the song, then slowly create another drop from that. 

If you don’t know how to do any of this, just search it up on YouTube there will be videos explaining it better than I am.

Instead, you need to think what emotions the music is specifically making you feel and add elements that further that emotion. The music make you feel like your drifting around and longing for something? Add legato strings. It makes you feel like your content with everything around you? Add a second guitar part playing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that develops on the first ones ideas. It makes you feel driven ready to act? Add drums playing a rhythm that pushes the music along. Just don't add things for the sake of it, because they will feel contrived and won't fit (especially a sung melody, cos you run the risk of lyrics that sound really contrive).
Other than that, regarding drums I was actually baft as to where the strong beats were other than in that chorus at 1:22 so I can't help you there...

2\) Experience and intuition \- This looks like the second voice in the right hand is still part of the accompaniment, so it doesn't appear to be an entirely separate melody from the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

3\) The pedal is a tool to make things happen. The question is which pedal is going to make the sound you want to make. The damper pedal would certainly do the trick, but it will smear the articulation in the upper voices. You could potentially half pedal instead of full pedal if you don't want the voice to mix so much.

  
Alternatively, you can hold the bottom notes with the sostenuto \(middle\) pedal. Press down the notes, the immediately press down the pedal. The sostenuto pedal holds down any notes which pressed when the pedal was pressed, but won't hold any notes that are pressed after the pedal is down. What you do depends entirely on the sound you want to make.

4\) Those are duplets. These are like triplets, but instead it means to fit two notes over the course of 3 counts. 

5\) Not sure on the coding, but music playing in the video does not match the articulations being played.

This is an incredibly challenging piece for a beginner, and the timing is incredibly advanced. To play this piece well, you need to not only play all three voices distinctly, you need to be able to count them distinctly. I know it's disappointing to be told to not play something, but find something easier to play first, or get a much easier arrangement of this piece that drops the second voice in the left hand, and doesn't require as many hand jumps.

Slugging through pieces far above your difficulty level turns you into a key pressing monkey. It'll take months to slug through pieces, and you'll never get faster at learning music, and you'll never get good at sight reading. You'll play piano for years and only have 5\-10 songs to show for it, and you'll be completely sick of the current pieces you are working on by the time you get anywhere near finishing them. If you won't table this piece for later, at least make sure you aren't spending much time on it. Spend your time honing your skills, and you'll be able to play a much wider range of enjoyable music.

- Ernie Ball VP Junior: Sturdy, trusty, and volume-y. It does what it says it will and it does it well. What more can I ask?

- TC Electronic Polytune 2: Quick, clear, and percise. Probably the only tuner I'll need until it breaks, and going off of the construction of the thing, I don't think that's happening for a while. (Note: I also own a D'Addario clip on tuner that I use when I don't have a need for my pedalboard (i.e.: my school's jazz band))

- Keeley Compressor Plus: This thing is always on. It just gives that little bit of "fatness" to whatever I'm doing. It also has the nicest switch of any pedal on my board. Only complaint is that the light is blinding, but that isn't a unique problem

- Electro-Harmonix Little Big Muff: Picked it up from Guitar Center's online used section for $40. What can I say about a Muff that hasn't already been said?

- Boss SD-1 Super-Overdrive: My first pedal. I bought it out of necessity, because my band has a song that changed from clean to dirty in the middle, and I didn't have time to switch my amp. But, overall, this pedal is great, it's got great tone. I might switch it up a bit and buy an OCD or something, just to try new things.

- DOD Gunslinger Distortion: For $30, this is the best distortion you can buy. It's a cliche, but it can go from a boost to an insane metal tone just by playing harder. I generally have it as a grungey, DS-1-type-thing, but I like it's dynamicisity over my DS-1 (is that a word?)

- TC Electronic Spark Mini Boost: This is the smallest thing that could do what I needed it to. It pops me out from counter-melody, to melody. A great feature on it is it's momentary switch that intuitively knows to be momentary. No switching or knob turning required just hold it down, play a fill, let go, and go back to regular volume. I use it as a Solo/Fill boost, which it is great at.

- Boss PH-3 Phase Shifter: TBH, I don't use this much. But I do enjoy the step mode. I just don't like phasers all that much.

- Walrus Audio Julia Chorus/Vibrato: I haven't had enough time to give an in depth review on it but I like what I'm hearing so far.

- Fulltone Supa-Trem: This is the best tremolo pedal I have ever played. It's a no-frills sorta thing. I generally use it as a kind of "throb", keeping it low and slow. The double/half speed button is something more tremolos should have.

- TC Electronic Flashback Delay: It's not the best thing in the world, but I don't use delay enough to complain about it. I'm thinking of maybe getting a Strymon El Capistan, because I like the sound of delay, I just dont ever turn it on "spontaneously" because it's out of time. I just need something with a tap tempo.

Additions in the future: Like I mentioned before, replace the SD-1 with an OCD or something, replace the Flashback with an El Capistan, or maybe a Memory Man? But I think what's next is either the OD, or possibly a Micro POG.

Karmaworks is too busy. I think it's a weak song at a skeletal level, but the guitar leads make it even worse.

I agree that the distorted keyboard melody in the chorus of Head For A Breakdown is too loud in the mix. It's a grating noise that doesn't quite mesh with the guitar. It took me a long time to listen past that.

I wish the bass were more distinct on the Phoenix overall. I enjoyed how clear it was in the mix on AACBF. The most prominent sounding bass on the Phoenix, unfortunately, is on Replaceable and Wiping Off The Dead, where it's just following the rhythm guitar. Hearing the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> bass lines of Head For A Breakdown for the first time from YouTube bootlegs of live performances is a shame. They're buried on the album version.

This is not an uncommon scenario for the player to end up in. One of the biggest challenges in writing a good track for a game is making sure it won't drive your player crazy if they're listening to it for a long time \(I have no doubt that anyone who grew up playing a lot of JRPG's has had this experience at least once. Even great tracks get tiring eventually.\) Having said that:

The overall feel of the song is quite nice, and fits an upbeat, slightly quirky town well, but the track is very repetitive. Mix it up some. Change the bass line rhythm, throw in harmonies in a few spots, take the chord progression to a slightly less familiar area, create a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, change up the instrumentation. To put it bluntly, the track is too simple to hold a listener's interest for an extended period of time, or even to act as comfortable background music for a long time.   


That being said, there's a great foundation to build on here. Good luck!

To be honest it sounds like you just started making beats. The melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> don’t have any variation except when you transpose them up an octave. The drum loop is the same 8 bar loop throughout the whole beat pretty much. There is no interesting switch up or transitions into any new ideas.

</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriters</b> 2018-06-13 04:31:32 Indosay<br>Cool questions!

One of the things that I've learned that has helped me personally is to not try as hard for each song I write. 

To explain, since that sounds really bad haha, what I mean is that I used to approach each song I wrote as the most important song I'd written yet.  It had to be the best, it had to mean the most, I had to work harder at it than any other song, it had to have more of me than any past song, each part had to be perfect, each melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, each bridge, etc.  But that was such a bad way of looking at it.  

These days, I definitely write more on the fly, if that makes sense.  I tend to mostly write on bass guitar the last 4 or so years.  I'll come up with a simple progression I like on bass or sometimes a bass line, and maybe a melody or at least a good draft of one.  Then I'll record the bass part and come up with a simple drum part.  Sometimes I work the drum part out more fully here, but often I just get something simple down at first.  For guitar parts, I may have a general idea.  Like, maybe I know I want chords or power chords or just a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or an arpeggio or maybe I want it to follow the bassline.  But sometimes, I don't even have that.  Either way, I usually just throw my hands on the guitar and start fiddling with notes.  Find a note or two that sounds cool then just quickly try to come up with something.  Sometimes it comes quick, like within 5 or 10 minutes.  Sometimes it takes an hour or so of messing around on a few different things.  But usually I'll find something that works and I'll record it.  

Once all the major parts or ideas are down then I can start to tweak things.  Sometimes I'll rewrite or rerecord whole parts.  Sometimes things are 99% done.  Just depends.  

But anyway, I definitely now have the mentality that there are an infinite number of songs that can be written.  And for each song, there are an infinite number of parts that can work.  There is no write or wrong song or write or wrong part.  It's just about finding something that I like in that moment that works for me in that moment.  I find that I end up liking the song/parts much more that way, the songs feel a bit more inspired because I'm just sort of winging it so I end up with things that I wouldn't have thought to do if I had sat down and really tried to plan everything out or write what I felt needed to be the best version of the song or whatever.  There is *no* best version, just the current version.  I end up surprising myself more that way and, again, feel like my songwriting is much better and more diverse.  I'm sure it's not universal, but it definitely works for me.

I kinda don't want to encourage people posting their beats here for feedback but fuck it I'll bite.

The chords are nice but the keys synth playing them feels very bland. It also sounds super midi, not sure if you played it or drew the notes in but it sounds too robotic. The other synth is honestly not a bad place to start though it's a vibe.

Drums fall completely flat when they come in; you **gotta** have the hats come in right at the start. If you want to have it keep building as it goes then add like some more auxiliary percs in the second half of the section. Add another synth there too maybe, like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, nothing too distracting or in the foreground.

Either add some reverb to that snap in the breaks or use a different sample because it's dry as hell and I'm just gonna be honest it sounds like ass. Totally takes you out of what you had going. Otherwise mix sounds ok on my macbook speakers. Couldn't listen on headphones or monitors so I can't speak on how the bass sounds, but I couldn't hear it at all so maybe some more saturation there.

Also it's waaaaaaaaaaay too long. Keep your beats around 3 minutes. 4 minutes and 30 seconds is too damn long for a beat. Period.

Hope this helps, but keep this kind of post out of r/trap in the future. It's literally rule 5 in this sub.

* be prepared. Both you and your gear. Make sure you are familiar with the songs, know the chords, the keychanges,... and have your bassline worked out. Studio time is expensive, too costly just to mess around, so make sure you can deliver the lines in as few takes as possible, and with a consistent level of workmanship. 
* know the desires &amp; wishes of the artist. You're just an executioner, so ask her in advance what desires she has in terms of feel, sound,... for each of the songs. Does she want it laid-back with an emphasis on the root notes for one song, and something more adventurous and with counter-melody on another? Ask her, and incorporate that in your lines.  
* Also make sure your gear is up to the task, that means that your strings are reasonably fresh (except flatwounds, they can be a bit older for that old-school muffled sound), your bass can keep tune, and is properly intonated, and it doesn't buzz around from static.  
* be on time (both in rhythm, and when showing up at the studio).  
* LEARN HOW TO PLAY WITH A CLICKTRACK!  
  
Etiquette:  

* be friendly to the studio-people, as they are the persons who make the magic happen. They *know* the environment &amp; room they are in, so follow their pointers and directions. It may sometimes be something completely counter-intuitive, but 9/10 they *know* what they are doing, and they say such things for a reason.  

* don't noodle about when you don't need to play. Sure, you can warm up a bit, but that can be done unplugged in some backroom.
* don't mess around or joke around. Don't adjust stuff without asking the studio-crew.

Most of the song to me comes off as "empty" primarily there isn't much to really hear beyond the percussion and the melody.

I feel that there could be a stronger presence of a bass that not only keeps the rhythm but also highlights the chords which can invoke moods and swing the motion of the piece and that there could especially be something else in the middle between the melody and percussion that highlights and creates an atmosphere.  You certainly have the percussion, white noise, and the melody, but could benefit from having more depth and activity in the piece.

I pick a part I want to write- maybe the lead vocals or the harmony or the bass guitar or whatever. I pick a part, and I listen to it. I find the notes mainly by a guessing method. I sing the song, I play the song on my keyboard, I write the song down. Normally I only do one phrase at a time, getting all the parts right before moving on. It takes some time, but it's fun for me. 

To me, it's fun and it's gotten easier with time. I sometimes forget others don't have a background in music. I've been playing French horn for 4 years, before that I played trumpet for 3. I've been playing trombone for 2 and baritone for 1. Never played tuba, but I understand it's the bass. Because I've played these instruments I can understand how each instrument functions in songs. Normally trumpet gets the melody, French horn gets <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, baritone and trombone gets what I call supporting harmony. And tuba gets the bass part. 

When writing a song, I listen to it probably around 40 times before I'm finished, if not more. Of course it depends on the song.. Pop songs are more repetitive and predictable, so they're easier to write. "More than a feeling" by Boston took about a week to write. It has a lot of repeating parts in it, as does "Ride" by 21 Pilots. 

Music theory and playing an instrument helps me understand the make up of songs and how to voice the parts into instrumentation. It's a great hobby to have because I can never run out of songs! Although, it does get a little boring when I look into modern music because of how repetitive it gets.

I also found the small little break with the monologue in the middle to be a very interesting touch. As a song by itself I’d say it’s good, but I’d question it if it were a beat for a rapper to get on. Other than that, the mix, structure and all the other components fit well. I would just add personally a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to make it a little more interesting. 

Here’s mine: https://youtu.be/pFlGCM2_wx8
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-06-25 17:05:00 6InDaMorning<br>So I listened to your beat, and I’d say you got potential, just needa brush up on a few things.

First off, I’m not really into your style of music, but that just might be cuz I’m not accustomed to it. Anyway, the main things you could improve are:

- Sound selection: I don’t know, I just felt listening to the main melody and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> were kinda unusual in a way, but then again I might just not be accustomed to listening to that type of music. Also your drums could have cleaner sounds, particularly your kick and snare.

- Beat structure: I felt like you could have added more elements into the beat, some pauses here and there or some transition effects and whatnot, and maybe change the drum patterns to make it more varied.

Anyway, you got potential bro, just keep workin. Btw what specifically didn’t you like about the beat?
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-06-25 17:17:44 DecDub<br>Really like the main melody and the little <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in this. The 808 sounds like the one used in ASAP Rocky’s Praise the Lord. The only thing I would say is maybe lower the “bounce snares” if u get wot I’m on about.

Hey, you might remember me from another Warframe Fan track (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYc-8P628PQ). I'm back after the Sacrifice with a new track.

This one is based on "Smiles from Juran" which is played during "that scene" from the quest. I also included the original Warframe theme as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

Enjoy!

</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2018-06-27 13:53:56 InsaneFPSGamer1<br>So I'm still a bit new to terminology and such. So is <b><u>counter melody</u></b> the new melody you've "created" after altering the originals pitch? And what do you mean re-harmonizing to make it the new cantus firmus (mainly what is cantus firmus)
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2018-06-27 14:08:54 Joxton<br>The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is the new notes you created from the old melody. A cantus firmus in baroque music is a melody created to harmonize with other melodies (countermelodies.)  
All you are doing with this method is creating a new melody based on the original and then making the new one your original and harmonizing it with new chords. This creates new modal qualities and changes the emotional roles of every note so the originality and familiarity remains while creating a new song. 
</p></li><li><p><b>Breath_of_the_Wild</b> 2018-06-27 18:49:13 breafofdawild<br>Man, it was all over the place.  Hard to focus on the melody or even the counter-melody in many places.  It starts off really nice, but it quickly jumps into madness
</p></li><li><p><b>startrek</b> 2018-06-28 06:17:51 DaveIsMyDrummer<br>When they introduced the Alexander Courage theme as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> during the end credits, my jaw dropped
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-06-28 19:37:01 TheaOchiMati<br>Well... there isn't really a formula. It depends on what you want to write and what you want it to sound like. Orchestration is a pretty massive topic, and you have to consider things like blending and how divisi, doubling, or range affects sound quality.

By orchestra ensemble you mean string orchestra? I would start by listening to a lot of string orchestra music while looking at the scores.

I guess if you want a very basic way to do it, the melody needs to be present and you need solid bass to ground everything. So it is hard to go wrong with melody at least in 1st violins and bass in contrabasses. Have the seconds on the melody as well of you want it to be stronger. If it really needs to be powerful, violas doubling the melody too. Otherwise they can have something with motion to fill out the harmony, but make sure it isn't undermining the melody. Celli can support the contrabasses with the fifth, or another chord tone (but don't have them any closer than a fifth to the contras in a low register or it gets muddy). 

That's a really basic recipe, but you can and should be creative. Be kind to your performers, and make sure everyone has an interesting part. Instead of contrabasses holding an F for 4 bars, give them a rhythm on that F. Don't relegate your violas to playing whole notes for the harmony the whole time. Try the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the celli instead. Can the basses have the melody at some point? Maybe the violins can be accompaniment. Mix things up, and make sure everyone has an enjoyable part. Look at existing repertoire and see how they handle instrument balance, and the general role that each instrument plays at a given part. If you want feedback on what you write, don't be shy.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-06-29 02:52:39 MonsieurLeland<br>To be frank, I never modulate low strings and low brass. However, I often use french horns ensemble as a main melody between C3 and A3, because it sounds very epic, and then let high strings accompany them with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. So, french horns are prominent in the final mix, hence my doubts. 
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2018-07-01 04:38:47 Purge_Dreams<br>White noise is vey obvious and doesn't sound very appealing in the state its in, the clap/snare sample is not very present in the mix which really doesn't help the impact the track has. Sub sounds weird as it doesn't seem to be pulsing like the main synth (if it is you need to make it much more defined). The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> feels a little predictable, I think you could do something more interesting. You've got too many things going on at the same time which makes it difficult to focus on anything (chordal synth, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, background vocal chops, arpeggios all at the same time is too much clutter) I generally go by the rule that the listener can only pay attention to a maximum of 3 things at once anything more and it just sounds like noise to them, they need something to attach onto, that doesn't mean you cant use all those elements, just make them play with each other as in give each one its time rather than making them fight for attention (call and response type of thing). 

There's a solid track in there with a bit of tlc so keep working on it and be patient.
</p></li><li><p><b>drumcorps</b> 2018-07-05 01:08:43 jachas528<br>First, a question. Is the whole line mic’ed on the field? I assume the soloists are, is anyone else?

I believe these are greatest baritone solos/soloists in the history of DCI. Just incredible technique, range, flexibility, and musical sense. 

And not only are they great soloists, the baritone section is incredibly strong. Listen when they have the melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, they sustain their notes better than any other hornline I’ve heard this year or most other years. There are no breaks in their sound. Just awesome. 

And then we have the mellophones. 2007 Phantom, anyone? Again, power, sustain, and presence like we haven’t heard in many years. Just ripping through runs at triple forte and sustaining high notes like weapons. 

High brass, of course has both the fastest tongue in DCI as well as the highest note. Of course the whole section is destroying the super technical brass band literature. 

I wish I could see them live. The recordings reveal an intensity of sound and performance I haven’t heard since mid-90’s Madison. The hit in the ballad still gives me goose bumps even after listening to it dozens of times. Oh, to be in the front row for that!

I think we may have a legendary show on our hands, folks. 


</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-07-05 20:04:14 Cymai<br>I really like this beat. I do admit at first I wasn't sure where it was going, I thought it was too simple. But when the bass and the rest of the track comes together, I couldn't help but bop my head. 

However, when the lead synth melody came in, it threw me off. The melodys fine, but I think the sound choice wasn't right. The crunchy, distortedness of it seemed to clash with the smoothness/chill vibe from the rest of the beat. 

Maybe try a different sound, or even layering it with a more smoother synth. 

I do like how you layered it at the end though, really gave the beat a nice finish. I  think adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> might make it stronger finish tho.

Overall great some though!

2. Day trip
Not feeling the features flow rn but the beat is on point again good song as well

3. Summer time
 sounds like a banger from the beginning. Three autotune chorus in a row (I'm starting to assume this is your style. That's just my thought process not a critique in case that matters to you) but I like the song with the <b><u>counter Melody</u></b> for the chorus running over. I like the loaded gun just gotta cock me lyric

4. Cigs
No comments

5. Good die Young
I hear a little peep influence. I like it better than cigs but those two don't stand out as much as the first three

6. End the night
I like the first verse so far. Starting strong. second verse is good too. Some of the strongest verses so far.

7. Satellite and goodbye

Also wished there was more variation as well, that sound that comes in 2:28 could be used a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> too. I do like where every is sitting in the mix though so good job on that.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-07-14 12:29:06 MrSplinch<br>Glad I could help! The only other thing I would say is to have some more rhythmic variety across all parts. The melody could maybe transfer to the cello sometimes as well and possibly have a counter-melody in another part to add some unpredictability in texture. It sounds like it has potential, and I hope you create something you're proud of!
</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriting</b> 2018-07-15 03:24:58 frshtrx<br>As they say, the devil is in the details. Unless you have a very complete and deep understanding of how a genre creates its signature sound, then you can't go about reproducing it.

This would include everything from bpm to Eq and everything else you can consider.   
I'd start with using a metronome to match your meter to that of one of your favorite songs in the genre, then detail different aspect from there, instrument by instrument. For Stokes, I think the big take-aways are the bpm of around 155, "phone effect" vocals (mildly distorted or maybe phase inverted layers added), a clean <b><u>counter melody</u></b> single coil guitar layered over a space filling distorted hum bucker rhythm, snappy snare 4/4 basic trap kit drums, driving baseline with a high-octave harmonizer. It's where I'd start anyways.

There's a lot more layers in these well produced bands than you would think when labeled as "garage" rock. These are complete studio productions using every production trick in the book, and magically able to keep it sounding simple is their biggest trick.

Maybe it would help if you posted examples of your efforts for feedback towards this particular goal?
</p></li><li><p><b>gamemusic</b> 2018-07-15 12:07:52 Leithariam<br>This is very pleasant. I get a sense of sorrow in the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and harmony to the piano, but it resolves into a brighter middle then sad again at the end. I could honestly see it as a village theme or the theme of a very complex character. VERY well done. Would love to hear more from you.

For example, there's a scene in episode 2 which is sometimes referred to as "The Last Supper" where Dolores has the Confederados led by Major Craddock killed. In the immediate aftermath, the "This Word" Dolores theme plays, but instead of using ~~violin~~ it's original register, it's done on cello, very much like the MIB theme:

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-07-17 01:23:20 65TwinReverbRI<br>The middle section...not as strong as the rest.

It sounds a little like the problem a lot of people have, which is transitioning to one idea from the next. You did one of the typical "cheats" which is to slow way down and have a fermata at the end of a section, so there's still no smooth transition but it helps "soften the blow" so to speak.

In fact, I think doing it the 2nd time kind of ruins the effect of of the return to the A material idea - that's actually a very crafty resolution and works well, but delaying it kind of lessens the surprise. So that "how do I transistion - oh, I know, I won't but I'll just give it some breath" actually works against you there.

You know what I would do - just have the LH keep going up in 16ths in unbroken motion (m.19) so it "leads into" the Ab in the lower part of m. 20.

I think what makes this section "weak" is m. 21, 23, and 25, and the open 5th in m. 24 beat 2.

What makes the odd number measures weak is the lack of activity after beat 1 - it needs to have a "<b><u>counter melody</u></b>" or "bass line" or even just single bass note - *something* to happen. m. 21 - that tie on the Ab and not having anything on the beat comes off like a mistake more than anything. BTW, I don't mind the open 5th there, but it still needs "more" in the measure. Just a single bass note on beat 2, or two notes "le 2" .

Or, like the rhythm in m. 23 - have something "echo" that G-Ab on beat "2 la"

In fact, I could see "echoing" the first beat motive in the first 2 odd measures with the same motive on beat 2 - you could do one low, and one high (higher than the existing notes) for example. For the 3rd odd measure (25) I wouldn't do it again because it would be predictable and cheesy, but maybe the "echo" in 25 - which uses the melodic rhythm of 23,  could use the echo rhythm from 21 (dotted 8th, 16, 8th).

Some of those, like the one I just mentioned, could continue on to the down beat of the next measure, so m. 22 would have a low bass note in it on the down beat, and so would m. 26, while 24 would not, because it had either the higher echo, or the lower echo, either of which would just be "2 la" like the melodic motive on beat 1 in that measure. 

The reason I think m. 24 doesn't work is because that subtle change is a little too subtle. We're expecting an exact repeat of what's happened before - which I feel would be a little too much - you did too obviously - but it's a little too close I think it doesn't have the effect you were after....

Maybe try letting the moving line go down to Eb like it has been and the C will be enough - the "open 5th" there just sounds like a mistake. But if you want to keep that melody line, maybe the Dyad on top needs to change - maybe go UP instead of down like you've done the previous two times - Bb on top, or C on top for example.

I do really like the "crush" in 23, and the similar sound in 25. So def keep what you have there - just with the suggestions of "echoes" or something of that nature to give it a little more continuous and forward motion.

Now, I'm just some dude on the internet. So what I always tell people is, you can take my advice or not, but if you happen to think any of the same things I've pointed out, like "yeah, you know, I was thinking that measure wasn't really making me happy" then if someone else like me points it out, then it's probably worth at least considering looking at some more.

As for the A sections, I can't really find too much fault.

I would say:

1. Put your ritard. on m.1 on beat 2 - it seems a little funny just to start at tempo and then slow down immediately. Or maybe you just need 2 measures of measure 1, the first at tempo, then the 2nd slowing as your current m. 1 does. Would be pretty typical to repeat an accomp. pattern like this.

2. The melody at 12 - an octave up maybe? Parts of it doubled an octave up? Kind of gets buried in the busy accomp. BTW, I see where the next section comes from here, but here you've got the accomp going to keep the movement, but even in like m. 13 you've got "something" leading into the next phrase on beat 2 - that's what I think you need in the middle section. Also, since the middle section the melody is "under" the other part, it's still the same pitch level almost as here (Ab vs. Bb) so that's another reason I think this could benefit from an 8ve up or doubling.

3. I've got to say, the ending is "a little too "Greensleeves" " for me! I think it was REALLY effective in the B section leading back into the A section. But the one at the end almost verges on cheesy now that we've heard it a number of times. You even end the melody on beat 2 just like Greensleeves! I think, you might title it "rhapsody on Greensleeves" or something if you want it to be intentional - though the rest of the piece has little to do with it. Maybe just try a modal ending - keeping it pure minor, or doing the first one modal, and the 2nd one greensleeves or something. Or changing the melody or rhythm a bit so it's not "so" Greensleeves. That may not bother you but I can't unhear it now that I was reminded of what it sounded like! I'm afraid other listeners might think it humorous - but unintentionally so. It's such a well known piece too so it's less likely to fly under the radar than you might want.

Very nice piece! Even if you don't change anything it's still top notch. Congratulations!
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2018-07-17 01:26:03 Indosay<br>Haha, 11 years is a long time to play with the same people.  At that point, I'm sure you guys can pretty much play off each other without speaking.  Heck, we got to close to that point after just a couple years.  For us, we had 2-3 guitars depending on when in band's lifetime we're talking, but I was lucky as the bassist that most of the guitarists were pretty good at playing light, leaving space for everyone, and didn't need to play chords in order to play something.  It really sort of left the song structure building to me as the bassist.  One guitarist would solo, one would play a simple, light <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the key (or just fiddle on some little repeating guitar part, not chords).  Then they would flip.  So essentially, I could build the song around that, change chords, etc. and it wouldn't sound bad since nobody was truly playing chords.  It was a lot of fun to kind of "write" the songs on the fly.  And the drummer and I got really good at reading each other, knowing when to bring the energy up and when to bring it down.

One of the fun things the drummer and I would do was to almost try and trick each other.  We'd be in a low energy section and try to play a game of chicken with each other almost, how long could we stay in the quiet section of the jam haha.  We'd try to psych each other out by building quickly like we're gonna hit a climax but then not actually landing there and staying at the quiet part, etc.  We did that a bit live and the crowds really enjoyed it, because they all wanted the big climax too, so it was sort of a game we were all playing, just being goofs.  Fun times.  
</p></li><li><p><b>arcticmonkeys</b> 2018-07-17 01:43:58 TigermoonLoL<br>As some other people here have it, Beatles are my all time favourite band and AM are my favourite contemporary band. Gotta also say that I've never felt so hyped about news or stories, unreleased tracks and concert footage about any band except these two and with both bands I basically like every song they've done (though there's a few I don't have to listen to by both bands)

I think there's lots of similarities between the bands.


Lyrics. I think Alex and especially John share a certain taste for nonsense, playing with words and sarcastic lyrics. I'd argue that lyrics and drums are the only things in which AM are really BETTER than the Beatles, but I love Lennon's lyrics too and I see inspiration in the way Al writes.


I've mentioned the drums. Now obviously Matt is better than Ringo at the very least technically, but there's something similar in the way they serve the songs, and how they play smart and catchy beats. Reckless Serenade, Love Is A Laserquest, Secret Door, Dance Little Liar,... I could probably go on a bit, - drumming on these songs reminds me of Ringo somehow.

I think the bass is probably the most similar. I love both bassists and they remind me of each other a lot. Both use the bass as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the vocal line often and both have these "runs" where the bass almost loses it's place with "soloish" lines and then comes back just in time. This can be seen on a lot of songs, again especially from Humbug. Compare Cornerstone to Something (with this song I'd actually do it with everything, both have great bassline, melodic lead and solo, fitting drums, and both are awesome) Black Treacle, Snap Out Of It, and on the new album basically every bassline Nick did (SLLF, OPP and The Ultracheese especially).

Jamie, while technically worse than Harrison shares this "preciousness" with George. The lead lines are carefully crafted and each note has a meaning. Again I have to mention Cornerstone, Do Me A Favour, One Point Perspective, the solo from She Looks Like Fun.

Alex' solo in Mardy Bum sounds a bit like George too, although I'd say his guitar playing isn't as distinguishable.

Alex doesn't sound insanely similar to beatles, but his voice has a certain Lennon raspness, and the accent is also a little similar.

Obviously a lot of AM songs have beatles influence in them in the overall sound/writing, I'd say there's examples on Humbug onwards especially, ( the thousand times mentioned Cornerstone, Sias, Black Treacle, N.1 Party Anthem, 4/5, SLLF and Monster Truck).
And even before that (No Buses comes to my mind) 

Both bands are from North of England, both share a great sense of humour and a certain 'WDGAF about the industry circus' attitude. They also innovate themselves with every album.



Sorry for the awfully long post and how it's not arranged well (im on my smartphone, might edit some wording later). I just love these two bands too much.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-07-19 04:22:31 LukeSniper<br>Why does it *need* harmony though?

The harmony doesn't establish the tonal center. The melody does. Want proof? Song "Happy Birthday" in C, then "Drunken Sailor" in D. Now try stopping "Happy Birthday" on a D note, or "Drunken Sailor" on a C.

It doesn't work.

The *melody* is unresolved. The harmony just reinforces and supports where the tonic is. It doesn't determine it.

So yes, it *absolutely* is Locrian. Does that "7th" feel like it wants to pull up? No? Okay then. That's it.

The reason Locrian is generally problematic is because trying to add triadic tertial harmony to it destabilizes the tonic. Most Locrian *tunes* are best accompanied by drones, a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, or some sort of sparse accompaniment.

I especially like the bouncing perc that's real noticable in the intro/beginning. When the guitar <b><u>counter melody</u></b> comes in, it's real smooth as well. Could have been my means of listening this morning. But I feel like the kicks could be a little more pronounced. Overall it's great. Almost a full out jam eith the longer run time. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-07-20 03:23:18 65TwinReverbRI<br>Nope.

Much of this has to do with timing and what has essentially become "kitschy" or campy.

I'm not saying the music isn't well written, well played, and well recorded, but their continued popularity has little to do with music theory in any appreciable way.

Let me add this though:

The 2nd album I bought was Abba's Greatest Hits. It was before my music tastes really evolved (towards far less commercial and saccharine music) but that's how popular they were at the time. Plus there were two attractive women and I was the right age - which had just as much to do with their popularity than anything else.

But I've actually come to appreciate the musicality and artistry in the work (not really "theory" per se) and what has happened with me is even when I hear something I don't really care for, I try to look for things in it that interest me or I can appreciate - it could be just crafty lyrics - I just joined a Country band and I don't really like a lot of Country music at all, but at the same time, some of the lyrics are REALLY crafty - I don't even care for the content of the lyrics but approaching it from the "typical listener's" perspective, I can appreciate how crafty even pandering lyrics are. Or there's a great Tele guitar tone, or I really like a production choice, or a crafty arrangement and so on.

Things from ABBA that stick out to me are:

Dancing Queen - Orchestral parts and the gliss that starts it as well as that piano that cuts through.

Take a Chance on Me - "the "take a chance take a chance take a take a chance chance" <b><u>counter melody</u></b>/ostinato

Fernando - full of typical clichés but so wonderfully done - the acoustic guitar, the marching snare, the dual vocals after the first verse, then it explodes into this pop song. The backing instruments and arrangement again are just super well done. Perfect vehicle to show off the girls that would really appeal to older audiences at the time as well as contemporaneous audiences.

SOS - similar idea but more "poppy" overall - like a lot of their stuff, the synth work really blends with the orchestral instrument but this one has a really nice set of keyboard work in the intro - more "composed" stuff, which I like, and the synth line that leads to the chorus is great.

Waterloo - great uptempo "rocker" with a great groove and nice horns. Interesting chords in the verse.

Probably my favorite (oh, who I'm a kidding - like many, ABBA is a "guilty pleasure" band for me - the nostalgia of youth, the realization that they actually were pretty damn meritorious and not just pop trash) is 

Does Your Mother Know - I still can't tell if they had a vocoder or something on their voices during the chorus, and the opening synth bass line is just cool.

After ABBA broke up (I think) Frida released a single "I Know There's Something Going On" and I remember this from when it came out (the other ABBA stuff on the Greatest Hits album had all already been released by the time I got to it obviously) and heavy rotation on very early MTV. I only realized recently when I looked it up that Phil Collins produced and played drums. I always liked the song - it was kind of quirky in an odd way - probably that typical Phil Collins drumming - but was definitely an "80s" song and not a "70s" song like the ABBA stuff ( I did know at the time she was from ABBA).

Totally different, and maybe not as "good" as ABBA, but It was catchy - check it out:

It felt like the build-up to the rap was a little long to me, if I hadn't read in your post that there were lyrics I probably would have given up waiting for them. Then it felt like the energy dropped off between the verses, which could be intentional, but I wanted it to keep going up. Then the second verse was at the same energy level as the first. So, if the energy drop between the verses was intentional, maybe use that to make the impact of the energy of the second verse even more interesting by adding more to the second verse or some kind of interesting <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Either that, or take away some energy from the first verse to build towards the rest. As it is now, the track sounds great and doesn't need to change, but to me the energy level is stagnant. Great work!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-07-22 04:49:18 Luiishu<br>Yeah, there's definitely some nice counterpoint going on here and there. Welcome to Our Town is really good, especially with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the alto flute.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-07-22 05:08:34 First_Arcanist<br>Nice idea and vibe and also a great melody. A few things to consider:

The vocals are a bit too distorted. My hunch is that it's a bad microphone, so you should maybe think about upgrading. Secondly the song drags a little too much. I was a bit bored before the first chorus. Maybe try and introduce the chorus a bit earlier and also put in some additional instruments (pads, piano, strings or anything) during the chorus or second verse in the background just to give it some depth. Introduce a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>?

All in all it's a pretty good song
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-07-23 01:57:57 steeloscalpel<br>Yeah mix is muddy for sure, it was semi intentional but I could've overdone it.

Follows someone else’s style and workflow. 
You should always stick to what you’re good at and use that innovate to what you are not. Use this shortcoming to help you create you’re own style of introduction using drops or the technique you use when making your drops. 

For example. 

Take your FINAL drop, or your Biggest one and strip it down to one Instrument, but not the most important instrument. The most hidden theme, or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you have. Distort or break it up some how. Reverse or down sample it.  Do SOMETHING simple with it and go from
There.

For your beat, I’d say there’s a lot of things you could do to improve on. To begin with, the mixing was great, nothing was overpowering, and everything mixed well together. I’ll also add that your sound selection was very unique. However, your beat lacked some variation. I felt like you could’ve added some more melodic elements, or maybe even like pauses or buildups, to make the beat much more interesting. There was also a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> somewhere in there where I felt like I heard an off note. But you got lots of room for improvement bro, cheers
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-07-27 06:28:57 itsrohyo<br>main synth is really smooth. i actually think the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> going on in different parts of the beat takes away from the vibe that you have from the main chord progression. it sounds good still i just think a more cloudy <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would have made this have a lot better vibe. right now its kinda like healy mixed with eminem type beat lol. pretty solid tho bro and the mix is clean. keep it up!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-07-28 06:59:57 KnottyDuck<br>Imagine the French horn as a Brass Instrument that plays woodwind parts.  Deep swelling chord progressions. They fill out the brass spectrum.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2018-07-28 07:18:41 Alpha-Bromega<br>The reverse synths at the beginning sound too harsh. Fade out the samples. I really liked the part at 1:18 -1:31. I think you could work on this track using this as your main drop. Snare should cut more through this mix in this section but its definitely pretty solid. Its very lush. The chord you form at 0:22-0:23 its a bit to dissonant for the main synth. You could probably sneak it in the piano <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you have going on though. 


</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-07-28 12:00:27 SquidGang24<br>Add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, layer it, have two of the same loops and reverse one and pitch octaves, find some gross beat presets. It’s a lot of things you can do bro, you just have to experiment. Good luck

Do you think native language would impact the way of learning music? I will definitely try to forget years of semi-tone thinking.

Regarding urban music, it's actually not that complex. Everyone has a different way of working but personally, I always start with a melody. To me it's key. Then I make a bassline in relation to my root note, and layers octaves with pads, textures, additional synth, etc. It sounds full and it work very well. Finally, the vocal creates a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. I actually, never care of chords because they follow naturally from the melody note which starts each bar + the bass note + the additional synth + the pad. In the end, I've got a 4 notes chord without thinking about it.  Of course, I know it's wrong and I'm ashamed of it.

Though urban music (hip-hop &amp; pop) is a pleasure to produce for me, I have huge difficulties with epic stuffs. I never know where to start and I'm always thinking "what if this chord progression sound like shit once I apply it to my 25 pieces brass section? Will it work with a melody?". This genre is daunting.
</p></li><li><p><b>MusicFeedback4All</b> 2018-07-28 20:49:30 DeejayBlade<br>I think the intro is really sweet. The drums are really swinging nice and I like the guitars.

The first drop lets it down I think b'cos it makes no sense and doesn't transition very well. The end has more ideas veering away from the initial idea which is a good lil groove and all it needs is a bassline and maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and then mix up some subtle new sounds to keep it evolving and interesting.   


I think there's multiple ideas fighting for attention. I think the whole song is in the first 1m 5secs and the 4x4 bit is another song entirely.

I'm happy to answer any specific questions you have and I think it'll be more useful b'cos I don't know what you know or what you understand. Gotta make 'em specific and concise questions or I can only give vauge answers.

I'd be surprised if he understood 10 words of that lol. He's at the 8 or 16 bar loop stage it sounds like.

But to OP, that was the worst hurdle to get over for me, figuring out how to get a song to actually move in a direction. To be honest the best thing you can do is try to copy songs you like, like directly copying a rhythm or chord change, and also just throw random shit together expecting it to sound bad.

You gotta get used to making some really bad sounds, that's one of the best things you can do.

The song was written and described in such a way that I very much doubt a "real" version will ever live up to both the intentions of the author as well as the imagination of the readers.

However, there is still a way to do this scene well.  Remember, this scene is beautifully and emotionally *narrated* by Kote.  So: narrate it.  Let the scene have sound up to either just before the song begins, or just after.  Begin to narrate and describe the song, with the full emotion that I know I felt Kote imbue into the story at that moment.  Break the narration only for a couple of moments: when Kvothe sings out looking for his Aloine, and of course when she returns his call, and when the string breaks, followed by Kvothe's marvelous recovery.  

Every time that the scene should progress back to the impossibly complex melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and all that musical gobbledygook, simply fade the sound back to narration and continue to let the audience/readers fill the gaps with their imaginations.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-08-06 11:24:10 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;Is the reason it makes me think of spies purely because of media? 

Yep.

It goes back to the spy craze of the 1960s (also, the Cold War, where there were huge amounts of novels, films, and TV shows dealing with spies).

James Bond would be the primary one. The chord progression idea for the Bond Theme was so popular that Johhny Rivers used it in the pop song "Secret Agent Man" (also written in the same time period, with spy based lyrics) which became the theme song for "Danger Man" which was a British TV show that was ultimately picked up in the US where the name was changed to Secret Agent Man (not sure if Rivers specifically wrote the song for this show or they changed the title for the song and used it for the theme).

Peter Gunn (1958 IIRC) was probably one of the earlier TV shows with a "Private Eye" theme that you've heard many times. But this same kind of sound was common in the Spy films of the 60s.

Mission: Impossible is also lumped in here, with the now iconic 5/4 theme which is still used in the Mission Impossible movies to date - I saw the new one last week and it has some of the exact ideas from the 1960s TV series.

The Man from UNCLE is another one (went through a couple of themes for various seasons, one in  5/4...), I Spy is another. The Avengers in the UK.

That whole jazz band with the bluesy motives became uber common  - even in the Pink Panther films you get a similar kind of sound in many of the cuts (even though it's more Detective/Cat Burglar). Speaking of Criminals, the was one called "It Takes a Thief" starring  Robert Wagner (which is why he was in the Austin Powers movies - same for Michael Caine - he was in many 60s spy/criminal/detective type movies (original Italian Job) and the music for that was also very typical of the time period and similar in style.

But Bond probably had the biggest influence maybe outside of MI.

When I saw The Incredibles (the first one) I noted how much Giacchino captured the whole "spy vibe".

But if you listen to all of the music it's not really all that specific - it would be hard to pull out any single element or mixture of elements specifically related to "spy" music that also isn't found in many other soundtracks (even in the same era).

What happened is, we've seen so many movies, soundtracks, clips, and so on that have that "spy" sound to them - that were used in that context - we automatically associate the two.

Had that music been used for Westerns, we'd say it was westerns music.

One element that was sort of new at the time was adding electric guitar, as heard pretty prominently on the Bond Theme (played by Vic Flick). This was true of other genres at the time too (Spaghetti Westerns) so it's again not a characteristic specific to spy music, but it has been associated with it - so maybe elements that we could say are at least "common" and even "cliches" are the sort of ostinato backing (Peter Gunn, Bond, Pink Panther) with a Brass/Sax melody over it using some bluesy notes and the addition of electric guitar in a melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in many.

BTW, the famous film composer John Williams played the piano part on the Peter Gunn theme.

There are pop bands that merge the whole "Surf" and "Spy" genre (some of the Instrumental bands of the 60s like The Shadows had songs called FBI and Man of Mystery (hmmm, Austin Powers again...) and even covered stuff like the Peter Gunn theme. So the two were related and you'll hear people still talk about more recent genres of Instro that are still "Surf/Spy" (things like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits themes inspired bands like The Marketts to do "Out of Limits" and there's also the "Space Age" happening at the same time so lots of space/alien stuff gets mixed in there as well).
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-08-06 15:22:13 Mallow_GD<br>Your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is fucking beautiful. Overall the thing jells together really well. For sure think of a belly dancer. I almost wish there was a section where the bass changed up and it dropped into some 808s banging and quicker hats, but that's just me. If i had to change anything i would say the main instrument may be a little too banjo twangy. It doesnt kill the mix at all, but in contrast to all the other beautiful sounds, it feels a little more abrasive. Without changing a thing, Its a great mix man.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-08-07 23:15:20 MetroToven<br>It simply means that you don't have to make the melody over complicated. Give the beat some room to breath. The moment you stop being so formulaic and just go with what sounds good sound selection wise, you'll have more artists ready to work.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-08-08 09:01:46 cvbright01<br>Beat is super cool, I love the driving bass and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the piano.

Personally, I would add another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> halfway into the beat, just to spice things up a bit, maybe for a bridge or something idk. It dragged out. But even then, if it's dragged out, that means an artist can just rap his ass off on it. So there's that. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-08-09 08:29:13 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt;For me it seems like having basically all the awesome ability of a modern DAW inside your own brain. Seems worthwhile to develop. 

I would agree. However, I would caution that it is not an end in itself, just another tool in your toolbox, and I would go so far as to say in some cases, it can run into "party trick" more than useful composition tool.

But since I don't have the greatest hearing skills, who am I to say - probably the reason why I'm not a great composer!

However I'll add this - the most recent piece I wrote, for Trumpet, Trombone, and Piano, I distinctly remember "composing" the opening bars in my head while lying in bed at night, and had to make a mental note so I'd remember it in the morning. But the notes weren't specific - it was a general shape - I knew the two would be in counterpoint, I knew the rhythm I wanted, and the phrasing, but not the specific notes. That came the next day when I entered it in Finale.

A Guitar piece I wrote before that - totally composed on the guitar. Start to finish. Then I just entered it into Finale. It was "messing around" and "hitting an idea" and the right confluence of events and I wrote this little two page prelude in maybe an hour. It took me longer to enter the notes and tidy up the score than it did to compose it. But it was all "writing on the fly". There was no mental hearing other than "I want it to go here next..."

Another piece I wrote for solo Trumpet - totally in the DAW. I think I may have plunked out an opening idea in piano, but really it was written in the DAW.

Now - about the Tr/Tbn/Pno - I had worked out some ideas for note/harmony moves on paper and tried them out at the piano in my office and at home before I had that brainstorm laying in bed. So I had some idea of the "world of sounds" the piece was going to live in.

Also, for all 3, I really make use of the DAW in terms of organizing events - I write in a passage, play it back, and decide where it needs to go next. In the case of the T/T/P piece, which was slightly longer and more involved than the solo pieces, I sketched out 4 or 5 different sections - in fact I distinctly remember writing a section that had this <b><u>counter melody</u></b> I "heard" - not the notes, but I felt needed to be there - and I worked it out, but it just didn't sound right. I copied and pasted that section to the end and worked on the piece some more and as it developed I realized it was just too early to have that section there - it ended up later in the piece. So it's like this A section that the first time doesn't have the countermelody, but when it re-appears at the end, it does have the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> - which is the "right" place for it for me. So I did "hear" it needed this thing, but it wasn't the place it needed it in if that makes sense.

I'm not saying these pieces are great, or monumental, or boundary-pushing or anything like that. But I'm happy with them. I posted the guitar piece on a guitar forum to get some advice on notation (it's for classical guitar) and one respected member said "it's a bangin' little piece" which made me very happy.

But I didn't really "hear" them in my head. Nor can I really hear all the parts in a Chorale unless I listen to it through 4 times focusing on each part - and still may get the tenor and alto confused if they get too close or cross, etc.

But I can listen to a Rush song and tell you every single thing that's happening and with many pop songs I'll even know the actual pitches, chord formations and so on - because that's where I've spent most of my "ear" time. So certainly familiarity with a genre is going to be a big factor in this - if all you do all day is play 3 part inventions, sure you're going to be able to hear the individual parts better - especially if they're all of a similar style and with predictable elements and other clues to help you out.

Don't forget, Mozart's head probably wasn't full of Jazz, Rock and Roll, New Wave, EDM, non-western musics, Early Music, Atonality, and all this other stuff we've heard. If you had ONLY listened to Haydn growing up and never heard anything else, your abilities to pick out that stuff would probably be much better - especially if you PLAYED it too - and IMHO that's where the real experience comes in.

My colleagues that have these amazing "gifts" - well, they play Piano and have thousands if not 10s of thousands of pieces under their fingers - their experience is far beyond what the "kid with a DAW posting online" is going to be, and they've got thousands of hours on the instrument, playing music, listening to music, trying out things, and so on.

My ear improved DRAMATICALLY when I started gigging regularly in a rock band - because I had to pick up a new song every week. Then I got to the point where I was subbing and learning entire night's worth of music in a week or two. But you also get to try out stuff life, you have to listen more intently to what the other musicians are doing (if you, ahem, lose you place...) and so on. I'm not a real Jazz or Classical guy, and while pop music may be far more simplistic, learning songs by ear has been the main way my ear developed and I was working with a colleague last week on a Trombone Quartet piece (Bach's pieces from the WTC, Inventions, and things written for that ensemble) and I often surprise myself going "no, that's perfect 4th" or "no, there's the note we have to change the pitch of" and "let's gauge the tuning off the octave note right before it" and things like that. I've heard runs with 15 tuplets missing a note. I don't know how, but something just didn't sound "right" to me - often I can't pin point these things, but they're broad strokes - the pianist said, "oh, you've caught my error" and he corrected the passage.

I guess part of it is I'm an audio engineer too, so I tend not only to listen for music, but just sound in general - like I'm more likely to notice spit gurgling in a horn than a slightly out of tune pitch - so they're worried that the pitch is in tune and I"m like "we need another take, clear your spit valve" (which drives them crazy that I can hear that stuff). I did a choral recording where the vocalists were holding this long sustained note but one of them were holding their mouth in such a way that it created this weird "airy overtone" sound. The choral conductor heard the playback and their expertise allowed them to tell the player how to fix it.

So for me, there's more important things than hearing all the notes though I do that pretty well too.
But it's primarily a lot of playing and - well, I always say I don't "hear" things, I "listen" for things or to things if you get the distinction.

Since I don't need to replicate classical music, I don't need to be able to hear it well, other than to correct recording takes (and I typically work from the score anyway - but I can see what it was supposed to be and hear their error a lot of times).

But since I need to do that for pop music, I'm pretty good at it there.

When I compose, it's more broad strokes, and trying ideas - lots of sketching, and then "assembling" and transitioning and things like that.

I actually don't know that good hearing ability would help me because I would tend to fall into the same trap as "composing at the piano" where I'm going to fall back on things I already have heard, rather than trying out sound combinations without any kind of preconceived notions (other that what I might be trying to do in a piece).

I liked the start of the song but I wanted a bit more atmosphere out of it. Maybe like cutting off the lower frequencies and layering it with an 808 or something to give it a bit more impact. Around 1:02, I felt a bit let down and wanted to hear a bigger impact or a drop. Additionally I would've liked to hear maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or maybe a layer of the chords an octave or two higher.

Although I think the melodies are too loud in the mix especially the first <b><u>counter melody</u></b> but I really like the change ups of feeling unexpectedly in your beat. What I would do is maybe introduce a pad or arp, something plucky or piano sounding for the arp and maybe something ethereal for the pad just to give it that extra undertone to carry the top melodies. Also maybe try dropping the kick and one of your melodies for a section of the beat to then bring them in over your 808 which could be a little louder to give it that pump. Could also maybe put some Southside sizzle on the hats and your good to go. Nonetheless, this is a really good beat and this is just my view but with a few minor tweaks you could really improve it because the foundation is there.

With that being said, it is really appealing in so many ways and in my head I can see a lot of possibilities for approaching it from a rappers standpoint. The melody you made and the sound you used is really creative and catchy, and the bass <b><u>counter melody</u></b> makes it that much darker and the percussion hits perfectly. Overall really catchy and it sounds solidly made.

I have literally nothing to add today. Read /u/Harrytricks analysis and it basically covers everything I could ever say about the episode. The only other thing I can add is that while hair-down Ritsu is very good, [side-ponytail Ritsu is also very powerful.](https://imgur.com/Vj3xqm6)

As a musician, I would like to talk about my own instrument though. I've played a few instruments in band, but Alto Saxophone was my main, with a lot of Bari Sax later on. And like in K-On, my instrument represents some facet of my personality and matches me. The Alto Sax is super versatile. It can play high or low, fast or slow, jazzy or symphonic, melody, counter-melody, harmony, or keeping the rhythm with quarter notes. It's both a solo instrument and a background instrument. It's a bit of everything. And I think that's a good way to describe me. I can be energetic and talkative or shy and lazy. I can be confident and supportive as often as I am self-deprecating, depressed, and in need of support. I'm equal amounts the supportive friend and cheerleader, the worrywart, the confident energy, the depressed loner, the leader, the follower, etc. I'm a very versatile person depending on what the situation is, and I think my Sax is the same way. It's cool how that lines up. I think there's a weird extent to which we subconsciously choose our instruments based on that, or subconsciously change to match our instruments. It's pretty interesting. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-08-18 23:50:35 65TwinReverbRI<br>David,

I'm not sure why you did what you did in the accompaniment at the beginning.

Usually, one might pretty consistently have "full triads" on beats 2 and 3, and the primary reason for not having them is when a necessary note (especially one you don't want to double) is in the melody, so it's  left out of the accompaniment.

So you have an F# melody note in m.1, and typically that's where the A# would be included in the chord on beat 2 - you didn't.

In m.2, when the melody drops to C#, you also drop off the A#.

I think, maybe you were trying to go for a little <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in that upper note of those chords, but the move from F# to C# in m.2 really kind of obscures that. So I think I see what you were going for but it's like you did it the opposite way of what you "should" have (hey, it's your piece you can do what you want of course!).

I would just encourage you to try it the opposite way - that way the "melodic" upper note of the beat 2 and 3 triads would be moving opposite of the melody note's direction, which provides a nice counterpoint and won't obscure the secondary melody like in m. 2.

Or of course the other thing is just to use the full triad on both beats as you do in other places (when the chord on beat 3 changes).

A good example for you to consider is m. 17 - which has the A# on both beats 2 and 3 - you probably wouldn't leave it off there because the F# harmony might sound too empty or too "open 5th-y" sounding. Same is true of those other spots where the A# is missing.

So if the A# is not in the melody (3rd of the chord in the melody) I wouldn't leave it off of the accompaniment chord in many cases.

Something to try, or consider, and see if you like it any better or not.

____

I'm not seeing/hearing any inversions (am I? - actually, I just scanned back through and it looks like everything is Root Position - you're missing out on a LOT of potential melodic motion and forward drive in the bass!).

See, a alternate solution to what I just said, and piggybacking on what u/D4ruth says about the octaves on beat 1 being tedious - m.2 should just have an A# in the bass for example.

______


It's not bad at all. I don't find it too boring honestly (and I have a short attention span!) but it is kind of "lacking in interest". I'm always about more textural variety -  you've got some nice changes in register, and the return to the A material with the sudden piano after the build is nice. There are some changes to other chords of emphasis, so I don't feel like it has to be "Chopin" and go through 20 keys or be ultra-chromatic or whatever, but I do feel it needs some "relief" in some way. It's kind of that typical build build build until you hit the return of the A, but it doesn't "breathe" as well as it could if that makes sense.

But you hear stuff like this all the time so I mean, bravo, it's good work and well thought out. Just seems like you have the talent to make it even better if you open yourself up to more inversions, sectional differentiation, and so on.

Yeah, definitely, study the music of others more deeply - it seems you've got a good handle on the surface elements, and can now just start to get into the deeper layers and explore them.

Thanks for sharing your piece!

It seems like the side chain off the kick is recovering too fast. It doesn't feel like it's breathing. Makes it feel a little "jerky" to me.

I would like if you would introduce another instrument and maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. That same 16 bar loop is not enough to carry the whole thing. That's not an indictment of this particular 16 bars. Most songs will have a B section or a bridge or something.

Also, at least on my system, the bass felt very small. I could tell it was back there but the rest of the track really buried it.

It consists of motoric constant notes just churned out all strewn on top of each other. The principle technique being used is called conterpoint. Instead of thinking about chords the way music does today, it was just thought of multiple melodies played together. Bach would have anywhere from 2 to 6 of these going on at once, and was famous for improvising them. (Think Miles Davis times 6.) While there is a great deal of emotion in the music, that's not the point. The point is to feel the sheer complexity and beauty of the interaction between the melodies. There's an immense mathematical sophistication to the whole thing that nothing else really comes close to. To even hear two melodies at once, as two separate lines, is actually quite difficult and requires a lot of concentration at first. It's a very intense experience. 

https://www.teoria.com/en/articles/BWV772/index.php 

Go through this article, which analyzes one of his teaching pieces, that highlights a lot of contrapunctual techniques. He takes a melody and then reuses it in unbelievably clever ways throughout. Even if you can't read music, you just have to recognize how the shape of the notes is reused. It'll really give you some appreciation for this style of music.

Think of how difficult this is to compose. You have to have several lines that all sound good independently that also make pleasing harmonies when sounded together but also are different enough from eachother that they're heard seperately (imagine two lines playing the exact same notes at different octaves, they'd sound like one melody). Then on top of that you need intelligable patterns and motifs for people to grab on to and the song as a whole has to tell a story harmonically and keep interest. It's a completely different level from most music made today which is monophonic (one melody and some chords). In pop music you frequently hear two melodies on top of eachother but one is always dominant over the other. There's a dominant main melody, usually the vocal, and a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or two that props the main one up. In Baroque music there's several melodies and they're all equally emphasized. There is no main melody. This also makes it very difficult to perform properly because the performer has to bring out the equality in all the lines at once. That's why everyone loves Glenn Gould so much, because he makes it easy to hear the independence of the lines. If you read the article, you see how Bach can do all of this using one melody that he stretches and flips and distorts to create a whole harmonic landscape. It's almost inhuman in the level of sophistication. 

Obviously the music creates emotional experience, but that wasn't the chief concern of musicians until Beethoven and romanticism. Before then people were concerned with "higher" notions of beauty unconcerned with emotion. Many of Bachs songs are extremely emotional. I cry whenever I hear the Goldberg variations. Some of them are deeply moving. But it's not because I'm hearing sad sounds or anything like that (although they can be very sad). I cry because the immense beauty of it is completely overwhelming. It's closer to a religious experience than an emotional one. 

There's actually scientific reasons for this. Music can create emotions in a conventional sense or it can chase other feelings in different parts of the brain. Has music ever given you chills? It's a highly intense experience but it isn't exactly an emotion in the normal sense. It's related to a violation of expectation in a fairly specific way that tricks the brain into getting chills. The music is focused on playing with your sense of pattern recognition in a way that makes you feel like you see God. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-08-25 03:40:41 65TwinReverbRI<br>Em Key.

Notes for chords and melodies come from  key of Em. Done.

&gt;im writing most of the melody and bass line with the minor pentatonic scale

Which comes from the key of Em. So you're using notes from Em. Done. Except, you're limiting the note choices to a specific set of 5 out of 7 possible note.

&gt;Would I be able to write harmony and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with A min pentatonic or B min pentatonic

What notes are in Am Pent and Bm Pent?

They're all from Em, so yes. Again, these are just 5 note subsets of a 7 note scale - a specific subset. Since these subsets still have only notes from the KEY of Em in them, then yes, they could be used.

But this is not how you should think about music AT ALL.

People get stuck on "pentatonic". They could be 4 note sclaes or 6 note scales, or the whole scale. When you write music in a key, you use notes from the key. Done.

"thinking" "I'll use Am Pentatonic in the key of Em" is just - well, stupid. You want to write in Em, use Em. Em septatonic, hexatonic, pentatonic, tetratonic, tritonic, whatever "scale" it is - it's just notes of Em that you're limitiing for whatever reason.

You *can* successfully use a "limited set" like Am Pent because the notes are still in Em precisely because the notes are in Em. But the idea of using X scale over Y key is to create a specific sound or limit a set of notes to a particular set, not just to use to write chords and what not.


&gt;as following the circle of fifths, or does the circle of fifths not apply the same to the pentatonic scale

Forget the circle of 5ths. This is not what it is, and not what it's used for. I mean, don't forget it, it's important to know. 

But you don't use chords from one key and melodies from another unless you want a particularly specific effect.

Generally speaking, people don't generate harmony exclusively from any Pentatonic Scale even if their melodies and basslines are pentatonic.

99% of the time people are actually just writing in Em, using ALL of the notes of the key for their harmonies, and they may limit a melody or other lines (like a bass line) to pentatonic notes - most often Em pentatonic.

You shouldn't really be mixing scales or worrying about if they're related by the circle of 5ths or not.

It's in Em, use notes from Em. It's really that simple.

I'm in the UK and mostly play in brass bands, a lot of people tell me they think solo Euph is the hardest postition in the band: playing melody or often complex counter-melody, on a "mini-tuba" rather than an agile cornet. It's probably easy to sound good on a Euph relatively quickly in terms of tone, but producing the wide, dark tone takes serious practice, plus you are often stretched like a cornet in terms of technical ability.

I played a wind bands for a few years in my late teens and it was boring: doubling up as an "8va bass" with very occasional short, fast-ish passages. It felt like the composers for wind band didn't know what the instrument is capable of, or the role of the euphonium in a brass band was taken by one of the woodwinds instead (guessing clarinet or sax).

Edit: That was pretty sweet! I love the sort rhythm to it all, it feels almost galloping. Also love that part around 0:50 where Matt goes "and if you could SEE THE THINGS" I love it when he has that more full inflection, it sounds great. Also the music video itself was visually beautiful. I love the 80s synthwave stuff and I think it worked out great here. This is probably my second favorite of the ones released (I love Something Human more overall) but I think this was a great track. Only complaint is that the solo section feels a bit unfinished? I wish there was some sort of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to go along with the guitar thing, it feels like there should be one especially after the long held notes during it. 


</p></li><li><p><b>rap</b> 2018-08-31 03:40:40 chanolin<br>I think you've got some really neat ideas there, however I do have a few notes:

 Some pads/chords would be a welcome addition as they can really help add more fullness to the beat.

Also, it may be good to add some variation between verse and chorus. Maybe you could use a counter-melody, different bassline, pads

Lastly, they sounded a little quiet. I'd recommend reading up on compression. It very useful in making your track louder without peaking, however, use it sparingly. Too much compression can distort your track.

You've got great potential! Keep up the good work!
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2018-09-01 00:28:00 ReallyDrunkPanda<br>Douglas web 825. Cheap bass but I love it. I think my style is in line with Tim commerford from RATM. My tone is no where near his but play style is the closest I'd compare it to. Some slap and the basslines aren't outrageously hard but serves the song and can provide a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> 
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2018-09-04 05:53:02 sweetrileyraver<br>The mixing is good and overall sounds pretty professional, but be mindful of the high end. Turn up the volume of that snare roll in both parts of the track too imo. I think your chord/melody progression is good,but you need a little bit more going on as it starts to sound a bit repetitive. I would try introducing a new melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on the build/drop to make it sound more interesting. Great work
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-09-04 07:03:04 OzmodiarTheGreat<br>That makes sense. Continued practice will get you there.

I recommend sticking to diatonic notes in your chosen key (that is, no accidentals). Write a melody you like in your key and then write a second half of that melody in a way that harmonizes. Stick to 3rds, 6ths, 5ths, and octaves (in that order). If your main melody is leaping at a moment, try to stick to stepwise motion in the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Avoid parallel fifths and strongly avoid parallel octaves.
</p></li><li><p><b>songaweek</b> 2018-09-04 08:06:11 joycamp<br>nah man I love that big bass.  I would keep it. MAYBE back off the drive just a little on it.  You could also eq those acoustic guitars to stay totally  away from the low and would be able to have the bass still sound 'big' without as much volume.  But like I say, it all really works so no biggie.

Your drum mix is really big too.  Love the kick.

song is nice!  I found myself thinking that this song would really benefit from adding some sort of organ or harmonica <b><u>counter melody</u></b> as well but that is just a weird thought.

Nice choice of sounds and a really well structured beat with nice chops and variation. In terms of the mix, I would say you need to bring the kick up so that it thuds over the bass, not the bass drowning the kick out. Also a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> here and there could give it some more variation, as you should drop the bass for a short time with the main melody and bring a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in with the kick to give it that change up then hit even harder when you bring the main melody and bass back in with them. All in all though man really good beat keep moving forward man!

The sound and percussion choice got the vibe down completely and the melody was nice too. I would say to put maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in, so that the top melody doesn't have to play for the whole track, giving it that variation and switch up that it needs to bring emphasis on the top melody again. Also I would up the loudness of the claps and snares, and the bass I think is slightly distorted in terms of the vibes of the beat, maybe something more smooth and darker will go nicely. All in all though man nice project it was an individual beat and well produced. Keep going man!

This article discusses the music theory of Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony.

Sub-Saharan harmony is based on the principles of homophonic parallelism (chords based around a leading melody that follow its rhythm and contour), homophonic polyphony (independent parts moving together), <b><u>counter melody</u></b> (secondary melody) and ostinato-variation (variations based on a repeated theme). Polyphony (contrapuntal and ostinato variation) is common in African music and heterophony (the voices move at different times) is a common technique as well. Although these principles of traditional (precolonial and pre-Arab) African music are of pan-African validity, the degree to which they are used in one area over another (or in the same community) varies.

A forte in one piece might be the equivalent of a pianissimo in another. You need to think less in terms of volume and more in terms of colour and function. How are each of the parts in this piece functioning? Who's the bassline? Who's setting the rhythm? Where's the melody? The <b><u>counter melody</u></b>? What chord is being played? Not every note in any given chord is equal. If you're playing a dominant seventh chord for instance, the root and the 5th are not as important as the 3rd or the 7th, so you might want the 3rd and the 7th to be more audible.

Dynamic markings are vague because they're only suggestions. That doesn't mean if you see a *p* you can blast as loud as you want, but a *p* doesn't necessarily mean quiet. Like one of my clarinet teachers used to say "*p* doesn't mean piano, it means powerful."

So to answer your original question--Are dynamic markings equal between different parts?--the answer is no, almost certainly not. In your example, without even hearing the piece, if you have only one flute and 16 violins, the first thing I would assume is that the flute is the soloist, which automatically means that regardless of dynamic markings, the flute is probably the most important part and should always be clearly audible.

</p></li><li><p><b>MusicFeedback4All</b> 2018-09-08 10:00:24 DeejayBlade<br>I''ve experienced the same doubts, fear, insecurities, as everyone about my music. I'm just someone who got my music where I wanted and then realised others like me will also struggle and I can now shed some insight where to focus.

If I have no replies then I'm just a man talking to himself with zero context about how people are taking what I say. I'm only frustrated with the few that are active on the site BUT have never said anything about my critique. That's not the actions of someone desperate to improve. I know b'cos I was there and still am a lot.

Your hook is sweet and groove is good. The only thing I'd do is write another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or bridge if ya like and have a rest from the guitar for a minute and then it'll have a little more journey and seem more rounded. The change at 2m22secs is great and maybe think about changing things faster and then when you go back to the main riff it'll be welcome b'cos it wasn't so constant.

I would listen real close to the guitar b'cos I think I hear digital clipping and IF it is then it's b'cos your level is too loud, just start at the instrument and follow the whole signal flow and make sure nothing goes above zero and then you'll hear the clarity and then add distortion and it'll get 'bigger' sounding. You can clip some tools and not others, look up 'over sampling' and do it on ALL plugins that allow when you export to get the best resolution. You can clip a fader channel in Cubase b'cos it's 32 bit and the headroom is high so nothing clips UNTIL you compress it to less than 32 bit depth.

When I figured out the difference between harmonic distortion and hard digital clipping my music got much better quality. Metallica have some awful clipping on some of their songs. Noisia make DnB and they have no audible clipping and they're also louder than Metallica. A DnB group have better quality music that's louder than one of the biggest bands ever. Why?

B'cos Noisia care about quality-loudness and Metallica with all their money and resources care more about LOUDNESS. It's fucked b'cos Metallica doesn't need to be loud, it needs to be clear sounding so I can turn it up loud.

&amp;#x200B;

Take care :)

Yeah I meant what kinda artist. 

With your beat it sounds a bit like a Travis Scott type beat. Only thing I'm not a fan of is a sound that comes at 0:23 (not the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, but the scream sound). Would probably have lowpassed the melody before the drop too(e.g. around 1:21). Other than that, sounds good. I like the 808 in particular, that knocks hard. Is the 808 a sample or from a plugin?

I would say maybe you could have lost the top melody for a section, it got repetitive and with a melody as nice as that you want to loose it for a while to then bring it back in to give a different vibe to the beat and it will make the listener appreciate it more when it does. Try using the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> alone with the kick and 808, then bring the rest of the track in for the hook. All in all though good beat man keep going.

Pedals and Thoughts in order of signal chain:

* Ernie Ball VP Junior: Sturdy, trusty, and volume-y. It does what it says it will and it does it well. What more can I ask?
* TC Electronic Polytune 2: Quick, clear, and percise. Probably the only tuner I'll need until it breaks, and going off of the construction of the thing, I don't think that's happening for a while. (Note: I also own a D'Addario clip on tuner that I use when I don't have a need for my pedalboard (i.e.: my school's jazz band))
* Keeley Compressor Plus: This thing is almost always on. (The time I don't have it on is when I have the fuzz on. When I turn it on while the fuzz is on, it pushes the hell out of the fuzz, creating a way more intense effect). It just gives that little bit of "fatness" to whatever I'm doing. It also has the nicest switch of any pedal on my board. Only complaint is that the light is blinding, but that isn't a unique problem. Needless to say, it's a lovely thing.
* Supro Fuzz: I bought this a week ago on a whim because it was $80 (down from $199) and I had been unhappy with my Little Big Muff. I wasn't liking the gain structure, not to mention the fact that the tone control is essentially a switch between 'Angry Nest of Bees' and 'Is that even a note? It just sounds like a wet fart.' This fuzz is nice and dark, without being muddy. Nice, tight distortion. It has a clarity to it that I didn't get with the LBM. It's especially nice because I love stacking it with modulation. 
* Fulltone OCD: Bought used from my local GC for $80. Absolute face melter. 
* Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive: This is the perfect for a sort of 'lo-fi' overdrive that I love. K.I.S.S.
* TC Electronic Spark Mini Boost: This is the smallest thing that could do what I needed it to. It pops me out from counter-melody, to melody. A great feature on it is it's momentary switch that intuitively knows to be momentary. No switching or knob turning required just hold it down, play a fill, let go, and go back to regular volume. I use it as a Solo/Fill boost, which it is great at.
* Boss BF-2: Another Guitar Center Used section find, I got this thing because it's nearly 4 decades old and I needed a flanger. Nothing cooler than Vintage Boss, amirite guise?
* Walrus Audio Julia Chorus/Vibrato: Holy fucking shit, this thing is amazing. It's become my absolute favorite pedal. I use it for everything, from a subtle "doubling" effect, to a full on vibrato. It is beautiful in sound and looks. It is the best chorus. The only chorus. There is no going back.
* Deluxe Memory Boy: I don't actually use delay all that often, but I have a single part at the end of a song, which I need the tap tempo for. I love the modulation on it. It can even do some Thermae type pitch-shifting with the square-wave, which can go as detuned as an entire 5th up and down (and that's with the knob at about 3 o'clock). Not something I use day to day but fun to play around with. Great budget analog delay. Would recommend.
* EHX Oceans 11: Loving it so far. It's perfect for my use, as I like a lot of different reverb types, but didn't wanna spend $300 more for a strymon as I don't really need the presets. Cool features, like the auto-swell, Flerb, and secondary knobs. I almost believe that it is as veristile as the strymon, just without the presets, and it requires a bit more fiddling.

Additions in the future: I think I might buy a POG, but I don't think my rig is changing much for the foreseeable future.
</p></li><li><p><b>MusicFeedback4All</b> 2018-09-14 11:28:33 DeejayBlade<br>Thanks for posting in meeeee thready. :)

I think the overall balance is really good and pleasing.

I think there's too much reverb pushing the kick back. At 2m15secs the lower <b><u>counter melody</u></b> doesn't work, it's confusing, out of scale and this makes it hard to focus on.

Mostly I think if this is going for a contest it needs master treatment. You've produced and mixed it well so now I'll suggest how I'd get it to a louder presentable level.

Loudest average part of the song is -15LUFS. It's nice and dynamic so I'd put my best limiter on the master and gain it until it's basically tickling zero. The peak is about -3 so that's when it's gonna start clipping. Now how far you go beyond that without major distortion is almost entirely the quality of the mix. If there's more than 3DB of clipping I'd use a 2nd limiter to balance the DB load so they do half each.

After inspecting the wave closely I think I'd soft clip, compress, limit all my sounds 2DB and then 2DB-5DB on groups and this will flatten some of your peaks and then you'll get those DB back to add to the master level. Leave all the peaks untreated and you'll have either a loud distorted master or a quiet clean one.

</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriters</b> 2018-09-15 08:24:33 YungTargetBonusTrack<br>It’s a little chromatic with the sample as a chord progression. You can’t move sampled chords and not run into mode issues. Maybe you intended to do that, but it always sounds a little goofy and experimental, and I think “experimental” is sort of another word for “not enough self-control and precision”

The mix is clipping and it’s super muddy. Make sure that whatever you add is important and performs a different job, sonically. Like, for example; another string <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is going to fight with the frequency quality of the original loop.
</p></li><li><p><b>MusicFeedback4All</b> 2018-09-15 08:57:08 20nemusic<br>Thanks a lot for checking it out! Obviously I'm still learning a lot of stuff.

The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you mean the vocal chops? If so I 100% agree it doesn't fit haha, kind of ran out of time / wanted to finish.

And for the mastering I don't really have any idea what I'm doing. I just use Ozone presets and change a couple things but beyond that have no clue. I'll look up some of the stuff you talk about. 

Thanks again! 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-09-15 09:25:02 EnigmaRaps<br>I think you should play that sound that you start with for the first 4 seconds or so, that perc or what ever it is, feels a bit like a xylophone. Honestly keep that playing as like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or whatever, and then build on top of that. The drums got a nice groove through out but I couldnt get enough of that one noise. I think the transitions are all good. I think it would be good for rapping on cause lots of room for a rapper. I like the chords you used, and they definitely added the vibe.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing you might do is use that really electronic sounding synth you bring in at about 1:52(kinda sounds like a reversed sound?), bring that in a bit sooner on the beat, but only tease it a bit, maybe a pop of it here or there in places on the beat. (if that makes any sense) I think at the end of the beat, you should play it out how it is dropped in (all those sounds playing at 2:05, again with that slammin little riff I like). Really lets you ride the vibe, but subtracting elements right at the climax is a little anti-climactic.

&amp;#x200B;

Half of this is just preference. Not sure what you have done mixing/mastering but I cant give you much of any advice there, everything sounded pretty clean on my monitors. Keep grinding away, its the only way to heal that young broken h3art for real.

https://soundcloud.com/tocaofficial/future-bounce-track-v2/s-vLJOQ

This is a Future Bounce/Future House track I've been working on lately. There are a couple of small things here and there that are not done, but it's almost finished. I got a few questions though before I go ahead and finish it completely:

1) How are the transitions? Does the breakdown work together nicely with the build-up and drop?

2) Is the mixing good? What do I need to work on? (One of the things I know I need to fix is the synth that comes in at the main breakdown as a counter-melody to the chords, it needs to be EQ'ed better so it doesn't blend in with the other sounds)

3) What could I do to make the drop hit even harder, but still maintain this "happy" feel to it?

4) Do you know any other (decent) places I can share my track to get feedback?

</p></li><li><p><b>beats</b> 2018-09-16 15:41:04 prezdidit<br>Definitely brother we can sub one another and a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would add some interest and an 808 change up too thx brother great advice. 👍
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-09-17 01:15:33 KB0xx<br>Do you mean different melodies that appear later in the beat or a second melody that fits with the first one you made? Like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. 

For counter melodies I try to find something that contrasts the main melody but fits, for ex if my main melody is 1/8th note bells, I’ll get like a longer sound with not as harsh attack as bells like strings, and play 1/2 or full notes over that. 

For other melodies that come up later, I’ll copy paste the main melody and switch up the notes here and there to get a different feel and play with different instruments playing the same notes. 

Hope this helps you in some way

I only knew him as Erick or E.D. Anyway, he's pretty much the bass player I aspire to be if I didn't play with guitarists who just deserve more space. But Jamerson and Duck both amaze me with the spaces they create - like you could play root and 5 and have that much space.

I mean really, the answer to your question is, listen to other music and figure out what they did and copy it.

You've got a Melody.

You could do hundreds of things with it. It all depends on the effect you want - which you learn from listening to other music and copying it.

ANY instrument could go with it. You could double the melody, you could make a counter-melody, you could have counterpoint, you could have rhythmic instruments, you could have sound effects, you could have chords, and so on. Each one is going to have a different effect.

In fact, many times, people will take a melody like this and just try it many different ways to see what kind of effects they can generate, and then decide on one or a couple of them to use in a piece. So there's no "right" way to do this, and the only "wrong" way to do it is to create something ineffective (like something that's light, happy, and bouncy in a death scene or something, which might not be appropriate).

And you should always remember that sometimes, a statement like this can stand on its own and doesn't even need anything else.

It all depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

</p></li><li><p><b>synthesizers</b> 2018-09-23 17:20:30 wiremonster<br>Having a good musical idea to 'anchor' a track around is a great start, but it's rarely enough on it's own to drive the process through to completion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Knowing what the track is and what it's 'for' will help enormously.**

&amp;#x200B;

Is it electronica for the dancing to? Is it an interlude on an album? Is it aiming for mainstream success? Is it a musical journey to be enjoyed on headphones? Is it to freak people the fuck out? Is it to showcase a new synth? Is it a concept piece about monkeys in space?

&amp;#x200B;

**When you know what it is and what it's for, you will know where to look for inspiration when you get stuck.**

&amp;#x200B;

Writing a track for people to dance to when they're off their tits on MDMA? Look up artists who do this that inspire you and immerse yourself in their music for an hour or two. Listen to the techniques used from the artists and the audiences perspectives. Write down a 'road map' for your track - Intro (kick/vocal sample) - Next 16, Hats/Atmos - Next 16, Filtered Riff - Next 16, Bass and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>... etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Writing a concept piece about monkeys in space? Pull up some monkey videos and space footage, piss around with synths attempting to conjure a suitable soundtrack, make notes, write down a plan for your track and make it. Wake up the next morning with a resolve to never waste time on crazy stoned ideas again.

&amp;#x200B;

Writing down a song structure and considering the meaning of the piece are both key. This is actual 'writing', not jamming... it needs to be studied and practised if you want to get good at it.

It's rare to see someone who can drop super witty lines without years of practice, an unatural gift, or the patience to revise and redraft. Mad Men isn't a first draft, neither is The Office. People may improvise, but it's never by a novice. There's a lot of editing and experience that goes into witty dialogue.


There's many layers to building dialogue, and you have to understand each one before building on it to reach the next layer. You can't just say "Alan Sorkin views dialogue as music and plays a melody against a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> where each interplay is like a duet" without being able to write competent dialogue. 

Start with the basics, write like people speak, but better. Trim out the Um's and Uh's, cut repetition, turn every written discussion into the argument you perfected in the shower. No unnecessary words, every sentence has a reason.

From there, use dialgue as combat. Two characters are talking past each other to get what they want. Character A wants to go out to a nice restaurant, Character B wants a more fulfilling relationship. The discussion is about dinner, but every line pulls double meaning through subext. You take this and flip "You never listen to me, I wish you'd value my opinion or take my feelings into consideration" into "Well, last time I suggested some place, you went where you wanted to go." The motivation gets buried a level and characters aren't just blurting out their thoughts and feelings. Character's shouldn't just go around saying how they feel, that makes me angry.

Add character voice. Find a way to make one character sound different from another. Does someone have a favorite word "Like" or "So", does someone speak in long, complex sentences while someone else grunts out one liners? Is someone always accusatory? 

Once you have your characters speaking like idealized human beings, having people talk past each other so that there is a winner and loser of the conversation, and speaking in character voices, you can move on to witty dialogue. That often comes through editing. It's not uncommon to see drafts of scripts that start with characters blurting out their emotions while they all sound alike. Then revision passes happen where the author asks themselves "Is there a way to say this in subtext? Is there a way to make this punchier?" 

Punchy dialgue is short, to the point, and says only what it has to. Fat is trimmed, unintended interpretations are clarified away, and it's brief. 

Anyway, witty dialogue is a process and anybody who comes in with a single tip has probably forgotten the road they took to get there.

Edit: and this isn't even how to write comedic dialogue. That's another beast of a post in itself. Comedic dialogue isn't just funny people saying funny things, it's about people being dropped into unwinnable situations that they're given every permission in the world to try to win.

Sadly, a lot of composers and musicologist (mainly older generations) in academia consider his music very "commercial" like what pop music is considered. They also basically flat out accuse him of stealing. It's unfortunate they feel that way of Williams. But even then almost every composer does this in some way. Quoting themes, borrowing themes or arranging a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to an exisiting theme to create a new theme. Sometimes makes me think some of them are possibly jealous of his successful 40 year career as most composers/musicians hardly make a living. As a composer myself I look up to this man as an icon and has influenced a lot of my composition (along with Joe  Hisashi and many others like Stravinksy). Just wish people in academia would give him a little bit of credit for what he has accomplished.

Only thing that I would look into is the melody sounds a bit thin, could be getting drowned by the 808(EQ out the higher frequencies that the melody uses) or maybe turn it up or stack it a bit more with other sounds at lower volume as background/<b><u>counter melody</u></b>, some delay could also thiccen it up. Other than that this is very solid and impressive for 3 months of experience, well done.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-09-26 22:17:19 Conrad59<br>A classic way is to add another background part, e.g. chord riff, counter-melody, or percussion.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-09-29 01:36:30 dxmxnt<br>you should create more variation imo, not necessarily add another <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, but try half speeding or pitching the main sound up an octave for like 16 bars or something, that would really help imo
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-09-29 04:45:17 johnumbaugh<br>You had me until about 0:22.  That original synth or whatever it was is killer.  That is the strongest part of the song.  The toms that come in around 0:22 - they sound hokey.  And the synth strings or whatever they are at 0:24 or so - I am not a fan of this at all.

I could barely hear what's going on at 1:26.  No need for this.

1:36 - yeah... that snapping and that percussive element.... now THIS is cool.  Even the sample "hey" or whatever it is - sounds cool.  But once the strings synth comes in at 2:30 - I don't know, I'm just not a fan of it.  And the later chord progressions don't fit with the original that you had.

I would try experimenting with some much heavier, variegated bass that has a lot of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in it.... I think starting from there would make a killer track. 
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-09-29 15:10:11 johnnyhendrixga<br>If it’s done carefully, it can make for a more theatric ending for a song.

</p></li><li><p><b>drumcorps</b> 2018-09-29 15:47:21 drumcorpsecirclejerk<br>They play the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> which sounds cool

</p></li><li><p><b>NoStupidQuestions</b> 2018-10-02 04:14:08 chadrod<br>The note will be the same. Both are the same A.
However, tonally they will not quite have the same timbre.

Also, from a practicality standpoint it is often more/less desirable to play an open string. It really just depends on what you are doing.

For example, in many of the classical/jazz type pieces I enjoy, there is often a type of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that i play behind much of the lead melody, and in things like that it is often more desirable to play open notes to let them "drone" as a backdrop to the lead.


</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-10-02 09:43:02 DcmArk<br>I like the airiness of the strings. Decent melody.

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-10-02 15:08:08 mikeeltonmusic<br>I like that why not give it a go. Keep going you will get there,  one thing that helped me when it came to making my beats flow was start by building a loop then start taking things away and bring them back in though out the beat. For example have everything in for the hook, then have just the main melody and the bass for like 4 bars if it’s a short beat, then bring in the drums, then a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, before getting back to everything back in the hook. 
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2018-10-02 15:53:37 SpinalFracture<br>Get a book of drum rudiments, and let the exercises inspire you to write a line to fit them. 

Learn some saxophone/horn lines! A bassline is just a harmony-oriented <b><u>counter melody</u></b> played low, so learning any harmony-oriented lines will help you.

Come up with some pretend limitations, like no root notes, no fifths, no thirds, only roots, only thirds and sevenths, no playing in the first half of each bar, only play on beats 2 and 3, whatever you can come up with. Stravinsky played this game, and he was pretty good...

You'll notice none of what I suggested is "learn more scales, practise slow and with a metronome". While that might be useful advice for technique, if you want to improve in a musical way then it makes sense that you should practise in a musical way too!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-10-03 04:05:33 mc-sanders<br>I like it but I feel like the melody needs something else to keep it interesting, like maybe a counter-melody or some other sounds like some strings or a vocal sample. The mixing sounds good to my ears.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-10-03 09:01:39 KnottyDuck<br>A melody, in a basic definition, are just notes being played in a specific order in the same scale. 

Chords are made of the notes from
The melody and two other notes that support them. 

So pick a scale
Make a chord within that scale 
Go up one octave and play random notes in time and in key- that’s melody. 

Or. Play high chords. Go down two octaves and play notes in time in the same key and it have a Bass line. 


Or don’t do that and experiment. 

Most of the time you’re experimenting until you just KNOW what you want to hear. 


I hear the sound in my head and put it in my DAW. 

For me
It’s not “random”

I chose the key and make a melody and lay some chords then add some drum OR

I MAKE MY DRUMS and pick some chords and lay a bass and add a melody 

OR

I lay some bass and make some chords and make a melody  and add the drums. 

OR I SING my lyrics to the melody then add some chords then add my bass and throw down some drums and make a <b><u>COUNTER melody</u></b> to counter my lyrics.

</p></li><li><p><b>kpop</b> 2018-10-06 12:09:08 circa90melancholy<br>I agree. When I brought it up almost half a year ago, user Migster99 said this:

&gt;I've been saying the exact same thing this whole time! You can really hear it in the instrumentals. Take for example Knock Knock. You can really hear the sort of wistful nature it brought with the guitar and those bells in the chorus with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Even when I listened to it for the first time, I felt nostalgic for... something. The chord progressions are never the most complicated but it's more the instrumental choices that . 

It reminds me of [Miley Cyrus' 7 Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr0Wv5DJhuk) and [Avril Lavigne's Complicated.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NPBIwQyPWE), even though they have less of the same sad undertones.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2018-10-07 04:18:14 S1GNL<br>I almost always high pass (send) reverb.

I stopped to worry about the decay time. It's just too tedious to find the right setting if you're using one instance for many different sounds. I rather use the time to write a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with that bad ass synth pluck instead lol

I just put a gain plugin post-reverb and automate the output level.

Also, try to use the same reverb setting for different sounds but duplicate it and use different EQ settings (either within the plugin or with a post-reverb EQ plugin).

Another tip is the "reverb check ". Same as with EQing, you loose the objectivity after a while. Your brain will adapt to whatever you're listening to...

Bypass your reverb sends, playback your track "dry", and activate the sends after a while. You'll probably notice that the reverb levels are way too high. And also probably way too muddy.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2018-10-07 21:33:52 sweetrileyraver<br>Overall the mix quality is pretty decent, but you've got some highs the clap you are using clashing a little bit. I get that you may be going for that 'lo-fi' sound , but try and switch that clap out for something that has a bit more body to it and less crunch, and see if that helps solidify your mix even more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think the kick could use some eq on the low end, as well as some added top end(the 'click' part of the kick). I might try using a transient designer and adding some attack to get it to bite through a little bit more.  

&amp;#x200B;

This song could also really benefit from more use of melody or a possible <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. This will also benefit the overall tension/release throughout the song.  Nice work overall.

When I first heard the song, I was taken aback by the sorta cheesy chorus. The verse is very rhythmic and driving and definitely embraces the South African influences... and then for the chorus, the bass and guitar take a break while Paul croons a dragged out melody. I wish there wasn't that shift for the chorus.

If there's too much dialogue, I'll switch to summary. If I've been summarizing, I might switch to a description followed by an immediate scene.        
I try to keep the pace up not by necessarily having the plot move quickly, but by keeping enough happening at any given moment.

I think of it like music. I used to wonder if I needed the heaviness of metal to keep my interest, but after realizing that one of my favorite songs is [*On the Morning Dew*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6AHL5zdYI) by Elvenking, I realized that it isn't *heaviness*, but *business*. It's melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>; it's layered instrumentation.        

That's what I want in my story. I don't need huge plot elements (heavy metal) or a quick-paced plot (power metal) but what I need is stuff going on.         

Here's where it gets fun. You can only have one, maybe two things actively occurring on the paper. Literally, you can only write that one thing at a time happens, but you can get the reader to feel like at least two things are happening if you word it right; however, if you want more than that, what you use is *subtext*.       
You can give the reader a sense that many things are happening at once, or in rapid fire, by the clever use of subtext.        

The classic short horror, "For Sale: Baby shoes, never worn."        

Not much happening on its surface, but *beneath* the surface, you've got all kinds of grief, death, and a financial situation.

I probably can't do it well at the moment, but I'd like to be able to do it, and I keep stuff like this in mind when I'm writing.

space ur hi hats out they too robotic. also mess with their volume/placement. clap sound to me is kinda stock and could do with a layer. you need to create and build energy more. you do that when you cut out that drums but it's missing something - play with a pad or layer the melody on another instrument or something. a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would be helpful too.

I think this ironically ties into your critique of my instrumental, because I feel like too many counter-melodies aren't necessarily a good thing - I would personally add a beat switch instead (ie: make that second counter-melody last until the end of the song).

Death Cab is a band I discovered after hearing I Will Follow You Into The Dark for the 12th time. So I had listened to Plans. Then Transatlanticism, then Narrow Stairs. And I went all the way through the discography and every time I heard Nick Harmer play a baseline like the one in Summer Skin, or No Sunlight, or Crooked Teeth, or more recently Northern Lights, I would get more inspiration to learn it on bass. It gives me motivation to see the bass worked into both a harmony, a melody, and a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> role, gives me hope that I can achieve the song writing skill to see the bass worked into so many different roles effectively, even on songs that just have it in the background. The bass gives songs like Title and Registration so much more feel, and it’s these songs and albums that help my abilities as a musician grow.

Not trying to be too harsh but rather give you insight into maybe adding some supporting elements to the main melody, maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something to keep it from getting stale.

Intros a bit long for the adhd generation. I'm an old head so i can appreciate a build up but you lose accessibility so make sure when you have a long intro its really worth it.

This feels a layer or 2 short. Amazing drum and 808 programming, and sick background synths, but I wish more was happening compositionally. A nice <b><u>counter melody</u></b> the bars when the 808 drops etc.

as far as the intros, I try to leave it more open for the rapper to go off on, this is supposed to get extended into a 4 man cut. I think that intro could have been like 8 bars with the same effect, it just felt really nice

I think I'm gonna see if I can get a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> going, I'm just trying to find space in the mix, maybe some midrange synth? I just have to decide on what and where haha
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-10-19 00:28:52 80hdADHD<br>Listen to a great piano song; it sounds full and they don't layer anything but one instrument. Energy comes from arrangement and composition, not just layering. I suggest you arrange every part on piano or keyboard. If you want to understand composition, read about string arrangement and study piano (personally I like Claude Debussy).

&amp;#x200B;

A good quick tip, though, is to take the third of the chord and put it an octave lower (like a cello). The bass could also be a counter-melody that adds movement through rhythm. Do whatever you want to do; no rules; no one's listening when you're experimenting. Just don't do the same thing every time if you want to grow.
</p></li><li><p><b>TheFence</b> 2018-10-20 02:17:32 BeautifulJaymes<br>It's not my speakers, I think its just his playing choice. I *feel* his playing, I know it's there, it's just more like support than counter-melody. Which is fine, it serves the song and thickens up the sound, but it's just not my style as a bassist. And also, P-basses don't cut cut like Jazz basses, which is what I play so I'm more used to that tone.

Pretty melodies and interesting lyrics. Polished up they may have been something. I find the song Garbage Dump interesting also just because of the ending where it goes into a Beach Boys like vocal thing with harmonies and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

As you walk through a house you don't see everything all at once the first time. The first time in you notice the shape of the room, the furniture in it, maybe some decorations. Eventually you move on to the next room until your tour is over. The next time you walk in it's not just a tour, you notice you're in someone's house. There are painted pictures on the wall. That s a wood and glass coffee table. This carpet is a lot softer than I remember. Moving upstairs to the next room... The next time you enter the house you realize that it's time in front of the doorway, that's a leather sofa and that carpet is a soft brown. Your e in the living room, blankets on a meat stack on an atm chair. You go upstairs and through a hallway lined with family photos. 

More details emerge as you become more familiar. Personally, I have a hierarchy of listening to music, and you almost certainly do too even if you don't realize it. I'm a musician and percussionist/bass player. So I first listen to the drums, and then the bass. I especially listen for how the two players (or however many that band has) communicate and play together. Then I listen for melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>/rhythm lines. As I listen to the whole song, I isolate those in my mind. The absolute last thing I listen to is the lyrics. If I could do karaoke just doing a dumb bass with my mouth I absolutely would.

Listening to Tool recently I heard a whole bunch I haven't heard or understood. Same thing with the ELO album Face the Music. 

Usually for me, noticing those types of things enhance the song. But I get what you mean about making it worse sometimes. I can't really listen to punk or especially 80's rock without hearing a blazingly harsh and reverby snare on 2 and 4. Always 2 and 4, never any modification, always present and lurking in the background. 
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-10-22 21:32:12 jordanpatrickbeats<br>1. Chord progression or melody, sometimes a sample. (Usually i stick with omnisphere, keyscape, or electrax banks for sound selection)
2. Whatever I didn't do in step 1
3. <b><u>Counter melody</u></b>
4. Drums - a hard hitting kick, usually a layered snare, and whichever hat I think fits best. 
5. Synth bass or 808, sometimes Trilian's basses.
6. Percussion and any other smaller detail elements

From there I throw an EQ on every track and EQ to taste, compress the kick and sometimes the snare. If i'm using a sample, I usually pitch it up or down a bit, run it through MGranularMB by Melda Productions and make it completely unrecognizable and use it as an atmospheric type thing. Reverb, delay, and Wider plugin on whatever I think needs it. I usually level things a bit as i go but always end up turning everything down to 0 and then leveling from there. I use pink noise to get an okay base level and then level the rest of the way without pink noise. From there I export as a wav and master it in a new project, usually with ozone. My mastering chain usually consists of an EQ, compressor, limiter, and finally a stereo imager.

You don't need chords but that just depends on what style of beats you make. Chords make it sound more filled, or just different in general than just a Melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, but you want them to fill background space, not over power the beat.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-10-23 02:57:57 Lwke_<br>I make instrumental music, not hip-hop beats, but I will have up to maybe half-dozen melodic elements? I suppose it depends what you consider to be a 'melodic component.' Bassline, pad, rhythm guitar, lead guitar(s), synths (lead, counter-melody, arpeggiated lines). While there are a lot of layers going on, I do my best to weave them together in a way that doesn't sound too cluttered - often just introducing them one at a time allows the listener to make sense of multiple melodies. Also, making sure they aren't all in the same frequency range, different tone/timbres, different panning/positioning (reverb, etc). Most of the melodies I come up with are relatively slow/sparse, so combining a few of them together sounds cohesive. Just a few random thoughts, hopefully somewhat helpful! 
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-10-23 04:37:04 rockymaxwell<br>What is a base melody? And then the top melody? And moreso... the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>?

Also a bunch of producers use loops as well, Songs like Future x Juice wrld's "WRLD ON DRUGS" produced by Oogie Mane, Gunna's "Oh Okay" produced by Turbo, and Migos' "Deadz" all used loops from [Looperman.com](https://Looperman.com).

Good work on the song, its definitely got a nice vibe. I like the vocal chops, they fit really nicely.

&amp;#x200B;

I especially like the part around 1:33 where you dropped the drums and then brought them back in. It sounds like you added a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> around the 1:30 - 2 min mark but I would recommend trying to change things up a little bit so that its not quite so repetitive.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-10-27 06:02:29 xREVENGEx<br>Nice vibe you got man. Real playboi style. Got to say though the bass and chords that hit at the same time were too loud, and it was hard to separate them, its the right idea, just need turning down a little. <b><u>Counter melody</u></b> was fire. Keep going man.
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2018-10-27 08:54:33 Dr_Strang3l0v3<br>Your playing bears no relationship whatsoever to the actual backing track. It lacked any sort of dynamics, buildup, melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, or direction whatsoever. It was aimless playing for you to try to show off technical ability in limited scale shapes and repetitive patterns-- the musical equivalent to masturbation. It's not good music. Congratulations, you can play a little fast. That means you sit amongst literally anyone who practices shred techniques for a year or so. Get rid of the ego and go practice; you aren't as good as you'd like to think. If you were, people would actually buy your music or support you as an artist.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-10-29 01:14:15 phrixious<br>I think you could take this piece to the next level by adding some <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. The right hand can play the half notes with two fingers, you have three left over to have some sort of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> going on, adding a third layer as well as an extra dimension to the piece, giving it more depth and more turmoil to express anger. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-10-29 08:59:04 xREVENGEx<br>You got the right idea, it wasn't dark enough for halloween theme though. Just try taking your melodies down an octave, along with the bass. That will give you that darker vibe. Mix needs some work too, sharp clap was too loud and so was the melodies. Eq the low end of the melodies if you haven't already, and try and keep the kick and 808 the loudest part of your track. For that haunting vibe also you don't want too much happening with the melody/<b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Just something simple with maybe some off beat notes to create tension. You got the right idea man just needs some tweaking. Heres mine if you get time.

Edit: touched up the mix with your awesome suggestions and also took a first attempt at vocals. They're not perfect but you'll at least see what I am going for. Made the track public on SC

Haven't tracked the vocals yet but this is a pretty straightforward alt-rock diddy. Clocks in under 4 minutes which is a first for me and I don't know how long.

&amp;#x200B;

Musically its pretty simple. Most interesting thing is that starts with a little guitar lick, after the first chorus a subtle <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is introduced which grows  in intensity until if over takes the original melody

&amp;#x200B;

Curious about the EQ/mix so far.  Also, I want this song to steadily build over its duration without every exploding. Does that work?
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2018-10-30 00:12:57 Samjollo<br>Solos are all about adding something different. If you hear a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the verse or bridge, turn up the volume and find out a way to play it a bit different that incorporates bends, slides, arpeggios. Music theory can surely help to an extent, but go back and listen to your favorite solos and see why they made it your favorite. Solos are supposed to bring a unique technical flavor to a song, and in my personal opinion the ones that are wrapped up in theory give no expression and come off as bland experiments in sweep picking. 
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-10-30 07:06:48 _Apex_<br>Dem drums bang. Adding some additional drum fills would add such a crazy amount of flavor to this beat. Additionally, I'd like to mention that the flute can be brighter in the mid to mid-high range.

</p></li><li><p><b>todayilearned</b> 2018-10-30 23:46:25 Twoisnoe<br>It's interesting you should bring that up, as there was a point in my twenties where I felt I was less good at playing by ear, and that somehow my attempts at trying to 'learn' music (reading) was somehow blocking it. Illogical thinking, and likely untrue, but I remember feeling that way about it.

(I've never stopped trying to read it, when I've been truly curious, and the very basics have always stuck with me - All Cows Eat Grass, F.A.C.E., Every Good Boy Deserves Fruit / Good Boys Deserve Fruit Always. (for understanding which sound was represented by which line/space) - and basic breakdowns of notation for timing.
I get a bit lost working out what key something is in. And I'm still terribly unfluid at reading it.

Practice on that front (or rather, lack thereof!) is a good reason why not, I'm sure. :D

But on the flipside to that - I am a million times more comfortable improvising with other musicians than I used to be, even as recent as 10 years ago I was quite shy. So it's been quite liberating.

The flattering point is when they're riffing around on a made up tune, and ask me if I can think of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or a harmony to go with it. Yes, yes I can! It's no classical wonderment, but it does the trick. Now watch me turn the national anthem into a minor key Samba, or drop the opening notes of Girl From Ipanema as sneakily into whatever's being played, as I possibly can. I did that for every damn tune, one session.  That's the fun bit about playing by ear - knowing how to turn something on its head, and just doing it. :)

Also, try using a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> also because you got nice breakdowns and build ups but sometimes after the breakdown I was like "yo somethings gonna bang now" but it never came. Try using a dark piano in the octave above your top melody to complement it. Nice production though man keep going. Blessings.
</p></li><li><p><b>radiohead</b> 2018-11-04 16:45:01 ItsBabyKeith<br>Subtlety or nuance in music would refer to small details that add texture to the song and make it more listenable. Adding a faint instrument here, a slight change in timbre, a background <b><u>counter melody</u></b> etc etc

Dynamics is less about the volume/force of a song and more about the contrast of attack within a song, building up to something and crashing back down, like waves.

Just because something is loud or brash doesn't make it dynamic - it's the contrast with quieter, slower, or more nuanced parts that gives it dynamism.

So yes, the 1998 version lacked subtlety and dynamics that the IR version has in spades.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-11-05 00:32:32 phrixious<br>A few comments on the score (I haven't listened to the music yet):

* you should have some sort of title!

* tempo marking is missing, looking at the score without the audio I can't guess if this is a slower tempo, or cut time, etc.

* dynamics are also important to have. Is the bassoon playing quietly in the beginning, or is it a big entrance?

* some phrasing/slur marks also help to guide the eye in what's important in the music and how it should be phrased and whatnot

It may not seem like a big deal to you right now, but it's important to work on these things from the beginning, because if you do one day get a real commission, you're more likely to forget them since you haven't done them on every score/individual part

Edit to add: Also, don't be afraid to use the entirety of your chosen instruments! Why not have the right hand of the piano play a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with the bassoon, for example? Explore the upper ranges of the cello, or have a little diet between the bassoon and double bass. There's no wrong choices!

As for your track, I really like the intro. I liked the transition into the beat as well. The main issue I felt was it was really repetitive, it's a 5 minute beat and there really wasn't much easing up. I would add some chorus room where the 808 drops out and you have like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with just the drums to give the listener a chance to refresh his ears. The mix is solid, everything sits nicely and I like the sound selection.

I like the way this pad starts the song off. Its spacey, the phaser/fx you have on it give it that atmospheric feel. The drums and bass accompany each other well and are laid in nice patterns filling the space well without being over abundant; they feel like a live drum set being played and the drummer feels "in the pocket" as they say. A simple jazz feel from them; really fits the melodies in the track. The brass <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you have feels very natural, I would try to find a way to bring it to the front so it feels more like a live set being played in a dive bar/jazz club. The instrumental is well composed and doesn't become boring at any point, really feels like it belongs on one of those anime lofi beat channels on YouTube. Getting a Cowboy Bebop vibe from it which is dope. Well done!

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2018-11-07 00:53:44 halfachainsaw<br>This is where music gets really challenging, but it's also where you find your voice!

(For background, I went to school for composition after running into the same issue and wanting to dive in deeper.)

There are a couple easy tricks you can try out until you develop some sort of compositional language for creating, developing, and linking together cohesive ideas:

* Build up some layers.  Maybe try one loop where you fade in the chords (or do a filter sweep or whatever you feel like). Then add another loop where you add drums.  Another loop, add a bass line with a new instrument.  Another loop, add a lead.  It might seem cheesy but if each of those things adds a new layer of interest to the song, then the listener will continue to be invested in the idea, and you've essentially quadrupled your mileage (in terms of song length) with that one loop.

* Create a contrasting section.  Go back to the drawing board and create something entirely unrelated.  For now, I'd recommend keeping it in the same key/tempo/meter but otherwise start from scratch and create something else.  Once you do that, you'll have an A and a B section.  See if you can get from A to B and back.  It's a really simple song form but it's incredibly powerful and it also gives you goalposts to start with and challenges you to fill in the gaps in between.  When you've got some more theory under your belt, you can try making them in different keys, or even different meters or tempos, and modulating between them.

That's a good place to start for just fleshing out an idea, but from there I'd recommend this: think about what you like about that loop.  Break it down into pieces, and see if those smaller musical ideas reveal anything that you can create variations out of, or develop further, to give you a hint as to where you can go.  Let me give you an example.

I think your loop is actually super interesting!  Here are some things about it that I like:

* The top voice is outlining a 3-note melodic idea.  The middle note lands on a strong beat and typically is not a chord tone, meaning that it's got tension, and the last note resolves that tension.  This is inherently an interesting melodic idea and can be used in other melodies.

* The rhythm.  Like I mentioned, that 3 note idea has the middle note landing on a strong beat.  When that's happening, everything is in unison, but near the end of the measure, things split up a bit and there's some syncopation.  So unison rhythms leading to contrasting rhythms is also an interesting idea.

* Part of that contrasting rhythm, especially the second time (at 8 seconds), is another melody!  That's called a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and yours has an interesting contrast to the first melody I mentioned, especially in terms of shape, and it's in a different part of the scale.  You can treat that as its own musical idea and develop it all on its own.

Then of course, the chords and bass line are implied also, and could be developed.

With these ideas in mind, I'd also recommend doing what the other commenters said and listen to lots of music.  Think about them in terms of small musical ideas and what those artists did to turn those ideas into sections and entire songs.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-07 04:29:46 steeloscalpel<br>Lmao thanks man appreciate it. Peeped you're beat. I fw the heavy 808 and whatever synth you've got for the melody. I'd just eq the bass so its less muddy and maybe saturate it a bit in the mids for some extra rumble. A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would go real well with what you've got. Adding more drums to give some extra bounce would be dope too.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2018-11-07 07:28:13 OrganicChemistrysux<br>A lot of good songs use the same chord progressions for different parts. They mix it up using a different rhythm and inversions/voicings.  Chord [progression](https://www.scales-chords.com/scaleinfo.php?skey=A&amp;sname=dorian) using the notes from a dorian have a good chance of fitting. 

Switching to a similar scale or relative mode is cool and usually works well for the bridge. The bridge progression you have is in g major which can work. The d power chord might smooth the transition since d is in G major and A is a step above G and step below B.

In general, it's easier to transition with less elements and simple/same rhythm. Consider a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> instead of chords.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-07 12:49:52 Wholesomeland<br>Definitel digging the vibe of this, that out of tune distorted piano is dope. I don't necessary like the notes themselves, the sound way too off sometimes. Turn back the snare / clap a bit. also some <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, something that could sit above the piano maybe could help make it more interesting. I'm digging the hihat patterns a lot though.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-07 13:12:44 tr0utt<br>i like how you tried to add some variation in the transistion sections but i think you could do more with those, try adding a new <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in those sections. i like the scratched section
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-07 23:02:11 The_Original_Gronkie<br>I honestly dont think you can approach orchestration from the technical/ scientific perspective that you're talking about. There are a few acoustic principles that come into play, but mostly orchestration is an art, and composers have shown a range of competence with it.

The acoustic principles I mentioned mostly have to with high tones cutting through the orchestral "noise" better than low tones. For instance, in a marching band, one piccolo can easily heard playing the melody over the muddle of a dozen tubas. A marching band orchestrator will quickly learn that you cant give the massed tubas a melody, because nobody will hear it. It will just come out as one low toned mush. But that piccolo cuts right through it. That's why marching bands often include glockenspeils to play the tune - their super high pitch cuts through everything. 

There is something to be said for waveforms, which I am not that familiar with. Brass instruments like trumpets and trombones can cut through a marching band far better than their woodwind equivalents like clarinets and saxophones. They have a sharper tone that allows that.

But that's marching band orchestration, which is the musical equivalent of murdering someone by bashing their head in with a rock. An orchestra is far more subtle. Occasionally those acoustic principles come into play. For instance, a single solo violin can be heard over an entire section of violins. The mass of violins produces numerous separate wave forms that are all slightly different, and the combination tends to cancel out some of the volume, allowing a solo violin playing a different melody to be easily heard above them. Mendelssohn solved the problem in his Violin Concerto by having the solo violin play primarily in upper registers while the ensemble played in middle and lower registers, and as we already heard, those high pitches cut through better.

There are also some limitations from the instruments themselves. You can't expect an entire trombone section to cleanly navigate a 16th note Allegro passage in unison, for example. The use of the slide is too limiting. Instruments have their high and especially low range limits due to the physics and acoustical properties of their construction.

Beyond those simple principles, orchestration becomes an art. How do you know to put the melody in the strings rather than the woodwinds or the brass? It depends on how the orchestrator hears it. He can use some of those principles - the trombones and low strings playing sustained chords on the bottom, while violins play a florid melody on the top, and the woodwinds play a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the middle. In the meantime, the trumpets and horns bide their time for a while waiting to blast the big glorious ending.

Orchestrators also learn through experience and study which instruments combine well. There are often melodies in the violin section, but often a composer will strengthen it  by adding woodwinds. What does it sound like when he doubles the violin melody with the flute section? How about the oboe section? How about the clarinet section? Each of those instruments adds a subtle variation to the sound of the violin section alone. A good orchestrator learns those differences and uses them to add variety and depth to their work.

Not all composers were great orchestrators, and not all orchestrators were great composers. Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition was composed for solo piano, and Mussorgsky never got around to orchestrating it before he died. Ravel did a stunning orchestration of it that is the most famous version, but others have tried as well. Another great version is Rimsky-Korsakov's, a fine composer and brilliant orchestrator, whose book on orchestration is still one of the basic foundations of the art. As fine a composer as Gershwin was, he knew his strength was as a pianist, so his works were orchestrated by Ferde Grofe, who was absolutely brilliant at it. Much of the love for Gershwin is due to Grofe's colorful and imaginative  orchestrations. 

The bottom line is that you will never be able to orchestrate based on science, wave forms, physics, acoustics, etc. Ultimately it is an art and a skill, and it takes study, practice, and experimentation to learn how to do it. The thing that helped me the most in the beginning was listening to a lot of music with the score in my lap, and committing to memory the sounds of instrumental combinations the way great composers wrote them. You will quickly see wildly different orchestrational  approaches between Bach and Mozart and Beethoven and Mahler and Debussy and Stravinsky, etc., but as different as they all are, it all works, and their orchestrations are as defining of the particular "sound" of each composer as the music itself. It is an imprecise method, but that's the way art usually is.

</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2018-11-08 11:52:08 slateflash<br>Orchestral viola parts are more fun than some violin parts because the viola is used to support many other sections so you could be supporting a main melody at one point and then supporting a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> played by another section at another and on top of that you'll still get solos. It gives you a more complete understanding of the piece than say a first violin part which only has the main melody.

But generally the viola has very little solo repertoire so if that's what you're looking for then you might prefer the violin
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-09 14:01:23 plutopistol<br>thanks bro and yea i guess it’s just personal taste. your beat is definitely catchy, i don’t wanna say this cuz it’s all anyone says on this sub, but maybe add some more melodies/pads or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>! nice work overall.
</p></li><li><p><b>trance</b> 2018-11-10 00:23:09 GuyFromNh<br>So interesting! I think it must be the way our brains are wired. I think some people really listen to the words more than others. Like, I can listen to a track and I'll remember the way the vocals interplay with the melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> far more than the actual words/meaning themselves. Adds a dimension tot he track, often more emotion than the base track alone. I think that is why I overlook a lack of profoundness in lyrics.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2018-11-10 02:45:33 shutupim_BRYAN<br>The problem with Claire de Lune is that people generally play the notes they see without actually paying attention to the details within the score.

For your interpretation, most of the notes are correct (the last chord you played in m. 34 is not correct), but your dynamics are pretty much homogeneous throughout the piece, and your phrasing needs work.

At the rubato at m. 15, you should be using the sostenuto pedal to sustain the bass notes, if your piano has one.

Beginning in m. 27, notice that the bass notes are each dotted quarters, your first finger on the left hand should be sure to make those notes stand out a bit more. This applies to other measures in this section where you see dotted quarters in the left hand -- be sure those stand out as a counter-melody.

In m. 37, really make sure your right hand 5th/3rd fingers are bringing out the melody. A lot people, even professional recordings I have heard, do not bring out the melody as it's written on the page. I hope this makes sense -- if not, I can clarify further.

Overall, though, your playing is good. This just needs fine tuning -- keep practicing. :)
</p></li><li><p><b>NoStupidQuestions</b> 2018-11-11 06:09:59 suupahot<br>As others mentioned it takes skill but also it is a completely unique and human sound. Try to think of it as an instrument that makes a completely unique sound.

I used to really like some singers in post hardcore music (Dance Gavin Dance for example) but thought the screamers would ruin it. After a while of listening to it anyway (because I thought that all of the other instruments/vocals were so good) I began to really appreciate the screaming too.

It would add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the songs and honestly it was a really cool contrast to the main vocalist. Also it would add an intensity to the track. 

It's all a matter of perspective and getting used to it. A lot of people have a negative association with being yelled/screamed at but you need to let go of that to appreciate it in music.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-12 17:47:32 TheToppa<br>Appreciate your time to review my track! Listening back to the track I definitely agree that maybe I could have added a shorter bridge to build up to the hook, thanks for the input!

As for your track, I really like the melodies, percussion patterns could be a little more diverse, your hi-hats are just a tad bit too loud bit it's nothing too drastic. Apart from that, maybe adding some variation to your melody our a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would help spice things up a bit. Good work!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-12 18:31:22 TheToppa<br>I was just about to say how your drums were completely off beat but then the track took off. It's definitely unique, you don't hear a lot of boom bap beats like this, it's refreshing. Melodies are funky but I think they get a bit repetitive, you should make some chorus room with a different melody or keep the same one but add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Scratches towards the end sort of threw me off since there was so many of them but that isn't anything too major. Good work with this one, nice chops as well.

I dropped this track yesterday, if you got time let me know what you think!

</p></li><li><p><b>gamemusic</b> 2018-11-13 16:32:19 scottarc<br>Thanks :D Really glad you liked it!

I think because fundamentally you *can* just swap sounds to samples from an old game console, there was a flood of "8-bit" and "16-bit" versions of songs, and the saturation I think means to this day people are instantly skeptical of retro takes on modern songs, because it is easy to simply swap the pianos for generic 8-bit sounds and call it a day... I'd like to think I go a little further with my remixes, through changes to the arrangement (new <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, percussion and bassline) and spending a lot of time mixing to make something more unique and listenable :)

In short, I fully expect people to be skeptical of anything I put up, but it's totally worth it to *hopefully* pleasantly surprise people who actually check it out, and for me personally lets me do my own take on these classic and (admittedly) over covered and over remixed tunes ;)

Cheers again man :)

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-13 19:27:31 LeockeR<br>I love the bass on this beat, the vocal chops do their work, but i think the beats needs a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on a new section, to make it more interesting, other than that i think its really enjoyable and smooth

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-14 00:58:15 TheToppa<br>Yo this is clean! Mix sounds really full and the percussion is smacking nicely! Those hi-hats are dope but they stick out just a bit, maybe lower the volume on them. You could also spice up the melodies a bit with a sweet <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to keep things moving. Besides that though, not much room for improvement here!

</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2018-11-14 06:16:27 vangelator<br>Wow that's so weird. I'm totally the opposite. I have a natural ability for rhythm and counter-melody but I can not pull harmony out of myself at all. 

In a funk context, if the guitar is doing those strummy, high register chords, that's the perfect chance to lay down something strong and rhythmic in your lower register. For funk, you are many times the literal foundation of the song, and you might not even have the chance to root note the guitar chords. Get the key, and see what funky rhythm you can come up with, and go from there. 

That's what I would do anyways!
</p></li><li><p><b>chiptunes</b> 2018-11-14 23:15:43 scottarc<br>Eh, sorry it comes across that way buddy, but I will point out two things specifically that prove that is not the case here: The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and percussion in the middle section are completely my own.

I'm not doing this to down talk someone elses work, but I came across this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgUUNloyTo8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgUUNloyTo8)

On this beat I vibe with the minimalism, it's well executed and gives enough room for a vocal in there. If anything, I'd make the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> a lil louder in the parts where the main one isn't playing. Awesome work!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-15 04:43:05 durian_smoothie<br>beat is a bit repetitive. <b><u>counter melody</u></b> has too much low end and doesnt compliment the main bells in that regard. i would just eq, dont need to change too much

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-15 07:06:37 Mallow_GD<br>Really cool bells. I like the 2nd <b><u>counter melody</u></b> a lot as well. Just some ideas because overall it's great already, some deep strings to come in toward the middle end might add another layer and give the beat more depth. Bells may have also been a little strong in the 500-1000 range, but it could just be what I was listening on. Dope mix.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-15 13:04:09 tr0utt<br>this hits hard, i wish the 808 had a bit more on the lower end, it sounds flat, maybe include that <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that you used at 1:24 more in the track to fill out the instrumental more

It is definitely possible to automate it more with a cutoff like you said. 
And a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is a smart move. :)

I fuck with the vibe you have going here heavy, the clap is a little distracting IMO but that really just comes down to preference I feel like. The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> going at 1:05 gets kinda distracting as well but I like the idea of it, I'm sure a good rapper could make use of it.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-18 06:52:46 Bluetorch_hmm<br>This is why I come this thread, thanks for the advice! I've been struggling with my kicks they either don't punch enough or they have too much reverb. Not sure if it's my mixing or the kick samples but I'm gonna work on that along with everything else you mentioned.

Your beat's dope. I don't produce trap so not much I can critique on. I wish the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> was a little more distinct from the main melody but that's about it. Dope bass, good melody, good stuff.
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2018-11-19 00:57:15 d4rkwolf1939<br>I could totally see this (hear this? hm...) in a video game. and it's not a bad production just on its own, although there are a couple things I can pick out that could be improved upon:

* Around 0:30, when the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> comes in. The synth which comes in there is overpowered, and it covers up what I'm assuming to be the lead. Pull it back a bit so the lead can come through, and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> sits *just* underneath it.
* The low end chords are tonically boring, there is no movement in them whatsoever. It's not bad at the beginning, because there are moving parts over the top of those chords keeping things interesting, and those chords are keeping everything grounded, but at 1:18, there's not much going on. The human ear gets tired of the same sound after not too long a time, so it's imperative to add movement to sustained chords like that if there's not much going on over the top of them. Add a filter cutoff automation or possibly a noise gate with a syncopated rhythm to maintain interest towards the end.
* At 2:06, you practically lose the lead entirely when that flute comes in. I can hear it, but I have to pay close attention to it, which is not something you want. Pull the volume of that back to where it sits below that <b><u>counter melody</u></b> synth. If it were me, I would also change it from sustained long tones, to a something more rhytmic to add movement, one idea I had was a kind of alternating eigth-quarter note rhtym, [here's an example of what I mean.](https://i.imgur.com/p3p7fY4.jpg) (sorry if you can't read sheet music, I can post a recording of it instead if you'd prefer, just not able to at the moment).

In general, get the levels of the mix more balanced, add some movement to the low end chords where needed, maybe to the flute (totally up to you), and I think you'll hear a huge improvement.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-19 04:46:01 Gr00mZ<br>Sounds really dope the drop is awesome. 

Maybe a bit repetitive like it feels like when u finished the first hooked you just like copied and paste the whole song back another time. For a trap beat which i think is meant for someone to rap over you can maybe leave only one verse with a fade out after and when they hit you up to get the beat they can ask for you to add another verse because otherwise it's just to repetitive. 

If you really wanted to have a 2 min beat you can like add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to it or just make the drum more aggressive or smoother to create an evolution to the beat. Otherwise it is really good. 

Keep it up man!  
</p></li><li><p><b>MovieDetails</b> 2018-11-19 11:55:55 Mace8937<br>It's the background music of it. Counter-melody I believe?
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2018-11-20 02:11:00 Priminator<br>Colin Edwin from Porcupine Tree. Anesthetize in particular has some fantastic examples of <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, whilst keeping the rhythm interesting and not devolving into a proggy-wankfest of notes.
</p></li><li><p><b>TheStrokes</b> 2018-11-20 06:51:30 notgoodbutrying<br>Well they use a lot of elements that define them. For example, “Someday” It’s super super simple but Julian just figured out the right chords. Something like “Trying Your Luck” and “Hard To Explain” have really beautiful Valensi chords and Albert plays the pedal notes that sound like lasers. Albert’s guitar is sharp and Nick’s is so beautiful, it’s a nice contrast.

Not to mention the BASS... Man it’s just so melodic, it’s like its own song in the background. Julian’s singing is also so raw and garageband-sounding. His voice adds the contrast.

In short it’s beautiful chords with dagger-like lead guitar, drums that just sound like they’re being smashed by a drunk guy who knows EXACTLY what he’s doing, and beautiful bass counter-melody all alongside Julian’s screaming.

that flute <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you have is real nice.  one thing i would make sure is that maybe after the intro try to keep things more center or equal in terms of stereo separation.  the main melody is so far over to the right that it takes away from the fullness of the beat.  other than that drums, mix, and arrangement are on point.  this is really dope for 30 mins.  

&amp;#x200B;

here's mine: [https://soundcloud.com/vvw\_music/scarface](https://soundcloud.com/vvw_music/scarface)
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-11-20 19:34:07 bchordial<br>I used to have the same problem. If you have a good grasp of key mixing tools like EQ &amp; Compression but still can’t get a good mix then your main problem may be in your arrangement &amp; sound selection rather than in your mixing skills. 

Mixing and Arrangement go together like Fitness &amp; Nutrition. So let’s say a good mix = losing weight. There’s a saying that goes “You can’t outrun your fork” meaning no matter how much you exercise, how you eat is an equally important factor in achieving your goals. Similarly, an inexperienced mixer can’t outmix his arrangement or expect to get a great mix out of a bad arrangement. Try allocating your sounds to available pockets of the frequency spectrum. If you start with a nice low ambient pad and decide to throw in some keys. Move the keys up an octave so they don’t crowd the pad’s space.

An exercise I used to do was to create a simple beat with only 6 elements that sound good together just off the sound selection alone. Don’t EQ yet, unless you need to on the main melody.

The 6 elements to try it out are
1. Bass
2. Kick
3. Snare/Clap
4. Hihats
5. Main Melody
6. <b><u>Counter Melody</u></b>

The kick and bass occupying the lows.
The main melody occupying low-mids to mids.
The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> occupying mids to high-mids.
The hihats will occupy the highs.
Due to the simplicity of the arrangement, the snare or clap shouldnt give you too much trouble if you selected a good sound. Just low cut it. 

A few notable beats with 6 or less elements are Mask Off, Bad &amp; Boujee, Bodak Yellow &amp; Money by Cardi B, Non Stop &amp; Nice for What by Drake, and even 1985 by Cole. 

So try cooking up a few 6 track beats prioritizing arrangement. Use a frequency analyzer to better understand what’s going on. Then try cooking up with 8 elements, then 10, then as many as you want.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-21 18:37:32 TheToppa<br>I really love the ambient melody that comes in right from the start but your percussion sounds extremely thin. Layer it or play around with some reverb/delays/compression to give your percussion some presence. Counter-melody was perfect, I think it's a bit louder on the left side than it is on the right side but I might be bugging, check that out for yourself. No further critique, solid track you got here!

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-11-22 01:55:23 DR0PPA<br>What bb^ said. I have a buddy who makes good beats but hes just lazy. If he took the time to actually arrange his shit and add a counter-melody or two, and FEEL out the song.. his beats would go from decent to good maybe even great...

One thing i notice a lot of new producers do? They throw a loop down, put the drums and then just loop it like 20x - you gotta give the listeners ears a break dawg... let the 808 kix and snares/clap drive the song for 8 bars then bring that main melody back in.. one thing that turns me off is hearing the same melody over and over and overrrr without a break... are you a loop producer generally? Or do you compose a lot of your melodies ?
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-22 10:52:27 durian_smoothie<br>drums are off beat and i couldnt really catch the bounce and vibe out

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-22 18:44:44 TheToppa<br>I think what the comment below was trying to say is that you didn't side-chain your kick to your 808, it's getting completely eaten up by the 808 and I'm listening to this on a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50X. For the first beat I would say definitely add some more variation to the melodies, the first real variation starts at like 1:55 and that's just an FX effect. Maybe layer some counter-melodies, some pads or whatever just to follow the melody. 

Same thing applies for the second beat, though I liked this one more, they melody was perfect and you had a great <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with plenty of ambient sounds throughout the track to keep it interesting. The snare and clap sounded pretty stock, maybe spicing them up a bit with some reverb/boosting the highs and adding a high-pass filter would have tightened up the sound. 

Keep working man, you'll get better with time for sure!

I definitely want to add some flair, probably in the form of  a counter-melody and percussion (I actually have a friend looking into that for me rn). The pre-chorus was definitely the part I was most iffy on, so I'll try to see if I can come up with anything better. Thank u again!
</p></li><li><p><b>tranceproduction</b> 2018-11-23 13:22:47 Vorantis<br>Structure really depends on what you want to add to your song and how long you want it to be, but here's a common structure for a typical trance track to get you started:

Intro - 32 bars, usually strictly percussive elements. This is to give DJs some room to mix your song in.

Verse - 32 or 64 bars depending on what you want to add here. This is where the bassline and other synth or percussive elements come in.

Breakdown/Buildup - Again, 32 or 64 bars. I would recommend 32 when you want the song to maintain a high energy level and/or if you don't have many new elements to bring into the chorus, otherwise you may end up with your buildup sounding a bit over-repetitive. Going with 96 bars here isn't uncommon for longer modern uplifting trance songs.

Chorus - Typically 32 bars, but can be 64 if you want to put new secondary elements such as strings or counter-melody into the chorus.

Verse 2 - 32 bars, repeating the verse from earlier in the track.

Break/build 2 - 32 bars, short and sweet to bring in the chorus again.

Chorus 2 - Same as before. If you're working with a 32 bar chorus, it's not uncommon to put secondary elements in the second chorus or even change key here.

Outro - Like the intro, but in reverse. Now to give the DJ space to mix your track out.

This will land you with a song around 6 1/2 to 8 minutes. It's not the be-all-end-all of course but hopefully this will help get you acquainted with the structure. When listening to reference songs, make note of the times when new elements are added or subtracted. Also, count the beats during those sections; for example, in a 4/4 track, 4 beats = 1 bar. So there are 128 beats in a 32 bar phrase. Hope this helps you, sorry it was written a little sloppily as I'm on a bit of a time crunch atm :)

Feedback for Head On:

Very emotional. You have a great voice. About what to add: does it really need anything? A slow ballad can do without being full of instruments cluttering it. Honestly, this one sounds really good.

&amp;#x200B;

Feedback for your other song Detective:

The groove is really cool and the overall vibe. About what to add: just put a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, maybe with a pluck synth, when things start to get too repetitive. The mixing part could maybe use a little work - the organ like synth sounds pretty harsh on the ears ( a lot of 4 kHz) and the mix could use a stronger bass as well as a louder master.

Agree with what readup09 said. What you got goin is good, but could take it to a new level w/ a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or two. I'd also change the main snare to be something more "soft" to fit the Weeknd vibe better. Other than that, love the hihats, mixing, and bassline. Good work!

I was already a devoted musician and composing my own songs (classical) and so my parents bought me a midi box and some cheap notation software.  I spent six months copying Beethoven’s Ninth, note for note, line for line, just so I could try to recreate it.  Turns out I didn’t have a Moog, so....yeah, it didn’t pan out.  But I learned so much about structure, flow, melody, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>....it’s one of the best educations I ever got.  
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2018-11-27 01:58:10 lman777<br>For 1 week, I'm impressed, but that isn't saying a whole lot.    
You're probably still getting the hang of things, so I'll go easy and just give some tips.  

1. It's way too repetitive.  I would recommend adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and more percussion elements.  A lot of what makes songs "great" is in subtle variations that the average person doesn't consciously notice.  It's the slight variation of the drums every couple of patterns, the small percussion additions here and there, the dynamics, stuff like that.  With that said there is a fine balance between too much and too little.  
2. If you can't add more to a section, it's better to just cut it short than repeat again.  It gets very stale.  I speak from experience on this issue, my stuff was very repetitive back in the day and I still have to be careful.  But less is more, so if you don't have anything more to say with a musical phrase, then move on.  
3. I recommend watching YouTube videos for tutorials.  It has helped me a lot.  I'm also willing to lend a hand if you have any questions (I also use FL Studio and produce trap/house/lofi and other genres: [https://soundcloud.com/f-u-s-i-o-n-4-2](https://soundcloud.com/f-u-s-i-o-n-4-2))

The intro is a little long for my taste - instead of the ending the buildup at :44 I would have gone right into the drop. You built up great energy and then it just kind of ends. The drops were solid DnB, although I think you could use another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with a different synth to add another element
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-27 05:02:53 nomediaproductions<br>This is pretty hard, needs some melodic variation though. Drums are mixed pretty well and have good movement, beat is pretty basic but it sounds good. Just need some different layers of the main melody or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something that can provide different energy to the track. I like it! Lmk!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-27 08:58:08 nomediaproductions<br>I like the vibe of this track! I don't like the low end that much though, the bass is boring. I feel like the sub bass needs some variation, or you could replace it with a 808 at certain parts. The track doesn't have a lot of melodic variation, but with the extra couple synths I think you could get away with no <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. The bass kind of kills the movement of the track for me though, def keep that in mind! Lmk [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0\_tfLrHrWA4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_tfLrHrWA4)
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-27 15:48:17 MaxRoses<br>Thanks,  ill def level the melody and drums, its the next step.
Yours is very dinamic, like the filtered "drop"? and both the melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> are on point, maybe a washed pad (varely noticable) way on the back, or some reverb at some point for the voice to have some space to pop? (just maybe) cuz its real fine as is, i like the fx on the changes, it gets movement from them.
</p></li><li><p><b>LetsTalkMusic</b> 2018-11-28 00:44:30 squ1bs<br>Being a musician can impede or at least alter how you consume music. Instead of appreciating the piece as a whole, I find myself focusing on an interesting chord or <b><u>counter Melody</u></b> by which point I have filtered out all the other instruments. I have often listened to the same song repeatedly, focusing on a different element of the mix. Sometimes my musical ADHD makes it impossible to listen to the piece as a whole. Gift or burden? I don't know I have been like this for over 30 years now..
</p></li><li><p><b>Cello</b> 2018-11-28 01:21:23 michemel<br>To add: musescore has free software and often you can find user arrangements for whatever you are looking for.

Joanne Martin has arranged 2 volumes of Christmas music. They work across all instruments. I would get violin, viola &amp; cello ensemble book for each. Part 1 is melody, 2 is probably hardest with <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, 3 is a traditional viola-type line and 4 is bass line. You can mix and match parts for example: 4&amp;1 or 1&amp;2 or 1,2&amp;4 etc. Use the parts that fit your levels. The books are called festive strings and more festive strings.

Have fun! I LOVE Christmas music!

Your track is really cool!  
Nice melody, even if i would have done another <b><u>counter melody</u></b>!

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-11-28 15:42:15 jshuue<br>&gt;Solid beat bro, I think the 808 can be turned down a lil bit though. Drums are solid and the melody's decent however I think next time think about adding another melody/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> to spice it up and possibly for a new section in the beat. Keep grinding!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-28 18:25:31 Woochia<br>Just a few ideas, hoping it helps:

- think the music in succession of tension and resolution, full and empty. Sometimes you want a part that sounds more "empty", more intimate to then have it full again. If you want a big "boom" in your music, it's better to remove elements before than adding too much after.

- if you want to add variation without removing the melody or the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, try playing them with shorter notes so it's more discrete. Or try to play them on totally different instruments  (you can them layer them for the end, where you want the big "boom")

- try to make counter melodies that are not the same length than the main melody. This can sound odd, but it can add a nice motion (like maybe just a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on 3 notes that loop). As the 2 melodies would have their own feels, you could use one, the other or both more easily maybe
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-28 20:38:56 TheToppa<br>I love the title of the track! Really smooth vibes as well! I really loved the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> introduced! Not hearing a lot wrong with this track, everything seems to mesh well apart from that snare maybe. Kind of sounds too bland if you know what I mean? Apart from that though, it's really dope! I loved all the variation you added!

Just dropped a banger, mainly interested in does this have replay potential? Let me know if you got time!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-28 21:27:21 JazOmen<br>I like this beat, the melody is nice and bouncy. I could definitely see Gunna on this. I think you could have mixed it better so the drums would hit a little harder. The snare is low and the hats are a little loud. I think it also needs a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Other than that it is a good beat. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-28 21:54:56 SergeantPepr<br>Ok, so you're calling the repeating notes from the start the melody, and that whistle the counter-melody? That's a big part of the problem; the whistle actually is the melody, and there is no "counter-melody".

Those repeating notes are actually just a "riff", or even an "ostinato" (basically a fancier name for riff anyway). A riff is not the same as a melody. Think about a rock song, we'll use Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden as an example cuz thats what popped in my head first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbBbFH9fAg

Listen to the guitar arpeggiating chords, much like your riff it is providing a texture to the music, but it is not actually a melody. The melody is in the vocals, and there is no counter-melody (maybe when he sings partially over the guitar solo, that could be considered 2 melodies, but certainly not the main riff).

&gt;so i put in a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> which is the high pitched whistle, then.. when i pull it out.. the track sounds like it goes "flat" like it loses the contour of the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and it sounds "missing" rather than it pulling out very easily and smoothly where it still sounds like the track is going fine.. What am i doing wrong?

Basically everything except that whistle is just simply texture for the overall beat. The whistle is the only actual melody, and so it sounds flat and empty without it because it is. Have a go at writing a melody that directly compliments the whistle, THAT will be your counter-melody that you can add in the second half of the song/whenever you want too. That melody will be the one that sounds really good, but will not hurt the music if you remove it. (Actually, the whistle would likely be the real counter, because it is a very bare melody, try to write a more active melody to counter it, and then keep the whistle as the counter-melody instead)

&gt;Specifically when it comes to hip hop beats there is a fair deal of counterpoint

Can you provide examples? I think what you are calling counterpoint is likely just the way basslines go with melody lines in hip hop? Basically basslines, riffs, and chords are *not* melodies, even if they are presented like one (i.e. single note riffs or bass lines). 

&gt; again the issue of no part being "Dependent" on any other to work..

You're on the right path, but this is a slight mistake in thinking. Although the melody line should be independent of everything else, everything else does need to serve the melody. The melody is quite genuinely the *most important part* of a song. And can often be what separates a "beat" from a "song".

But your music sounds chill, work on your melodies and you will sound really good.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-11-29 00:18:40 PGlydes<br>Very good concept but the melody is a lil boring try addin a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or maybe some extra pads. but it sounds nice overall make it longer homie.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-29 01:47:44 AugustusMusic<br>I really like the 808s in this. They have a nice sound and really fill up the bottom of the track nicely. I have to admit that the melody is a bit underwhelming. Just that one synth sound gets a bit boring, maybe could use another layer with a different sound/effect going at some point. Maybe chords, or a simple little counter-melody to go under it at a few sections? Idk, just a suggestion. It is mixed nicely, and there is tons of room for a rapper. Definitely a nice beat for only 2 months of making beats!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-11-30 02:54:51 TheToppa<br>I definitely wasn't expecting those percussion patterns going into this. Pretty laid back beat, not the stuff I rap over but I can appreciate the mix for sure. It's hella clean, I loved the variation added to keep the beat interesting. Only thing I can suggest is having better arrangement, the beat sounds all over the place in terms of that. No real chorus room, that fade out thing was way too long. You should use the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for the chorus room and leave the initial first melody for the verses.

The whole story arc in the episode was pretty much non-existent except to quickly bring the two couples back together. They also didn't have a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> song where two or more songs overlap each other to prove a final point.

The plus side though is that pretty much everyone in The Flash/Supergirl can actually sing in real life and the songs were pretty decent.

Dawn of Demencia is a Technical Death Metal band that i just recently fell in love with. The song linked above is mostly instrumental and is a beautiful song, probably not what most people think of when they hear the genre 'technical death metal'.

Personally I love the fretless bass and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is plays with the guitars. This song in specific feels like it has 'movements' much like traditional classical music would have.

The biggest complaint is that most of their stuff is more traditional tech death, and not like the linked song, while that isn't a bad thing since they are great musicians, it didn't have the same pull as this song did. 
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2018-12-01 15:14:54 wunderbier<br>**Agree**. That switch can be so jarring. It works best when the guitar part evolves from the melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and other instrumentation falls away to reveal the guitar. But even then there needs to be a musical purpose to it that can't be satisfied more easily through other means. Hard jazz kinda gets a pass from me since the point is to continually rework lead lines around a complex harmony and the solos get passed around and play off of each other. It's nerdy and not that accessible, but musical. I don't get the same "the music is the point" feeling from listening to guitar virtuosos in the rock/metal/blues vein.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-02 07:17:17 65TwinReverbRI<br>&gt; For examples, we were shown several songs, from Tubthumping to Call Me Maybe to Rolling in the Deep. Again, the focus is explicitly pop, even if music theory usually tends to use classical pieces.

Do you remember which  or which parts were given as examples of Polyphonic texture?

Look I agree with the other poster as well, and your general response - yes there are sections, and yes there are "subsections" of things (like just a particular instrumentation) that are "Polyphonic within an overall Homophonic texture". So things like that, or like "Quasi Polyphonic" would be viable ways to discuss what you're saying.

Good luck on the project - and thanks for clarifying the parameters - you have to understand so many people come on here with what my assumptions were - so sorry to assume, but it's the nature of these forums.

I think you obviously write well enough that you'll be able to argue any points well, or make cases for things that are "hybrid" kind of elements.

I did listen to the section you mentioned though, and I didn't really feel like it qualified at least in total as Polyphonic texture. More like "<b><u>counter melody</u></b>".

But again, your examples in class could have been similar and in that case it would make absolute sense to discuss them this way.

Tons of good advice here, I noticed the little delay on the attack of the violin, and to be honest I'm not a big fan of this part in the track, the high notes of the violin doesn't seems to fall into place. 

As you say, I think I might adjust the delay on the violin to match the attack of the piano, but change the harmonic progression on the violin to make a light <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

On the last part, I couldn't find what was a bit "off", and I think you got your finger right on it, I'm going to try this and update the track. I'll keep you updated, maybe in the next STS ;)

Not bad, I like the drums and I like the guitar I just dont think they mix too well together. It sounds very repetitive. With some vocals on it, itd probably mix it up but I'd also add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Also if you're just releasing a beat I wouldn't go 4 minutes unless theres a beat switch.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-12-04 23:24:38 Uptowngrump<br>Happy early birthday dude! Tracks dope, really cool synth on the melody. Just 2 criticisms really. 

1. Intro is a little long, either needs to be shorter or have more going on in it.

2. Melody is dope, but it needs some kind of counter-melody/harmony that comes in to compliment it even just occasionally to keep it feeling fresh. People might get bored/annoyed without anything else but that, and that would suck because it's a dope track.

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2018-12-05 06:46:54 fungsway<br>\- Pan your percussion well

\- Don't use too many elements, get the core melody down with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and match it with an 808

\- Keep the flow of a rapper in mind while you're arranging your instruments

\- Make sure you have breaks in your arrangement

\- Clip your 808 so it has that buzzing sound

\- Make sure your song doesn't sound flat by considering how it grooves

</p></li><li><p><b>musicians</b> 2018-12-11 22:23:54 rniscior<br>I feel like it depends on the music. With blues, a Trio is common practice and sounds appropriate with simple bass lines and distinct guitar playing. 

Certain pedals and sounds can really help with fullness in other applications though. As the other commenter stated a chorus will help, but you can also consider reverb (always good for additional tone color), delay, flanger, vibrato, or tremolo pedals. I often stack different overdrives along with reverb or chorus to achieve a more full sound when playing with my trio. I use reverb almost all the time though. 

You can also modify your playing style to be more melodic vs notey. This will help concentrate and build emotion while still maintaining the songs flow and showcasing talent. Perhaps while bass is playing a certain melodic line, develop a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> around that. I’m not saying don’t throw in some crazy licks and lines here and there (because idk what your style is like anyway) but maybe consider the solo as an extension of the bass lines vs being it’s own entity if that makes sense. 

Hope that helps.

The mix was clean and the overall feel of the track was good. I wasn't feeling the fast <b><u>counter melody</u></b> though, it seemed out of place in the overall vibe of the track, there was just too much going on in that part for me.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-12-13 03:51:10 Red-Octopus<br>this is hot but you need to mix up the melody or have a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, its very repetitive

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2018-12-14 22:07:34 Salemosophy<br>I’m sure there are some really great ideas here and a lot of potential in the piece. For me, it’s suffering from a lack of balance in form and some redundancy in terms of just being too fixated on taking ideas further than they really need to go. 

First things first, balance of form. There are these moments that seem big in concept but don’t come across that way. For example, I almost get this sense that the piece is beginning “in the middle,” as if what I’m hearing at the beginning isn’t the beginning of the work at all. 

Perhaps you can take some material from the “Aftermath” at the end and work out a way to introduce some musical ideas first before developing them - which seems like what you start doing right away without firmly establishing them at the beginning. 

I understand the chronological form you’re attempting. I think it works. But it’s a little off balance musically, and that’s something I think might actually be easy to fix if you incorporate something similar to Aftermath at the beginning of the work to introduce key ideas that will draw our ears to important moments you want to achieve an impact with later in the piece. 

You might also consider where you can cut this down to under seven minutes. You have some redundancy in sections that you can (and maybe should) consider omitting. Even though you’re developing material well and giving us more to chew on doesn’t necessarily mean you should. 

A great idea is great the first time, especially when you prepare it earlier. Too much of a great idea will ruin a great idea. No matter how much you want to hear it, develop it, repeat it, or splash it in, you’re better off just listening to the whole piece again than letting too much of a good idea lead to boredom. 

Add a third Clarinet part. At the level of skill this piece would demand, like advanced high school or college players, they’ll expect three clarinet parts. Reduced orchestration is for young, beginning bands. Also on the subject of orchestration, there are times you’re over-harmonizing your melodic line. 

For instance, you have a harmonic progression for the melody, but then on top of that, you’re harmonizing the melody note for note. I recommend choosing one of these methods for clarity - either note-for-note OR a chordal progression, but not both. For Wind Band, all you’re doing is inviting a really muddy sound, I think. 

You’ll have greater clarity when you look at your music as a mixture of “elements.” These elements are Sound, Harmony, Melody, Rhythm, and Growth (Form). If you write a melody, harmonize it note for note, and then add a progression beneath it, you get an imbalance of harmonic elements over melodic. A more balanced way is Melody, Harmony, and Counter-Melody if you want to accompany your melody with a note-for-note line AND have a harmonic progression accompany it. 

I need to stop here. TLDR: You’ve got great ideas. I like the concept. I think you should go listen to this like you’re hearing these ideas for the first time and figure out how to introduce the piece more coherently so that we can really appreciate these ideas as much as you do. Add 3rd Clarinet. Add clarity to your orchestration by isolating musical elements, avoid overharmonizing, etc. Salem out!

</p></li><li><p><b>maschine</b> 2018-12-16 22:00:42 Gmonie5<br>It's often that the most useful and creative workflow is to do simple 'on the fly' processing like Filter Cuts to remove muddy bass or a bit of compression to get a sound pumping (add colour, distortion, increase perceived volume) to give you an impression of how the sounds will fit together. But not to get bogged down with lots of processing in the production stages. This not only eats at your CPU early on but can be very counter productive. 

A couple of topics that really helped me understand processing are:

Levels, Metering and Gain staging. - Essential for an understanding of headroom, dB, RMS, Peak level, Perceived Volume etc which makes compression a much easier subject to grasp.

Compression is a tricky one to get a handle on. Try making a list of the uses of compression. Here's mine

1. Taming Transients
2. Enhance Transients
3. Dynamic Range Reduction (Smooth out performance levels).
4. Lengthening Sustain (Ring of a snare hit).
5. Adding Colour, Distortion, Analog sound.
6. Increase Perceived Level 

Phase/Polarity/Filtering/Harmonics (Overtones, Fundamental Frequency) to better understand - EQ, Distortion, Saturation

Acoustics (Hass effect) to help you better understand - Reverb/Delay.

Delay helps you understand Modulation effects like chorus, Doubling, Flanging.

As you can see lots of the processes/topics in Music are closely linked. I've always found that you get a much deeper understanding of a function if you know what its doing under the hood. 

Workflow is also a very important tool in music production. Make note of important hotkeys from the beginning. 

Take notes is also something i couldn't recommend any higher. If you find yourself stuck at a particular stage of production. Sit back listen, what do you like? (instruments, particular melody, Bass sound), What needs improving? What can be taken out? 

Think about the main features of any musical composition. Melody, Counter-Melody, Chords, Bass, Hook Samples, Drums, Fx, Tension, Release.

Couple of final tips :)
The listener will get bored on the fourth repetition of a particular sequence so add fills/variation on the 4 bar/repetition.
We can only focus on 3 different elements at one time (the fourth takes our attention away). Pick your 3 main elements of the song and make them sound amazing 1st (Vocal, Bass, Lead).

An extra violin part is something to consider. I usually put in background strings, although every time I try to add an obvious <b><u>counter melody</u></b> it ends up sounding off. I'll give it another go though. Software only though for now - unfortunately I don't know any violinists (maybe I should try to get to know some...).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-17 22:48:05 65TwinReverbRI<br>Not sure what you're asking.

"A Capella" in the strictest sense means vocals only - unaccompanied by instruments.

It's not a "form". It's like an "instrumental" is a piece for instruments only with no vocals.

Pretty much all A Capella works are going to have multiple lyrics.

There aren't really terms for if people are singing different lyrics at the same time - like in "Silly Love Songs" by Paul McCartney and Wings, there's a break where each voice is singing a different lyric line. There's no real word for that. It's just "<b><u>counter melody</u></b>" with different lyrics.

There's also the "Motet" which comes from the French word for word - "mot" - because "words" were used in the piece - and in fact, a lot of times the words were from different languages sung simultaneously! Probably not what you're after though.

There is a thing called "Hocket" which is a compositional technique where a single melody is divided up among multiple singers often with each singer just singing one word on one note, with another singer taking the next word on a different note. A lot of "Fa La La" type passages (but not the famous Christmas one) are done like this in Medieval music.

It might be worth checking out to give you some ideas:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocket

That page links to Motet too, types of pieces which commonly employed Hocket.

The resource is all the pieces that do it - figure out what they do, and try to copy it.
</p></li><li><p><b>explainlikeimfive</b> 2018-12-18 00:23:07 a-WaltzingMatilda<br>In a way.

Most of the instruments will be playing notes from the chord at any given time in the piece. Some will play full chords (or the countless variations of broken chords), like guitars and keyboard instruments. The bass instruments will play root notes (or inversions). Melody instruments will play the melody, or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, or a high supporting harmony line. 

But music isn’t really written ‘line by line’ as an individual melody. It’s written chord by chord to support a melody (or several). A lot of the lines fill themselves in by just following the chords. 

In fact, if you ever look at ‘The Real Book’ for Jazz numbers, they’re all written as just the chord names and the melody line. The individual players have to infer their parts from that alone. 

If that’s an odd concept to grasp, just consider that in your life you’ve likely heard words spoken but never seen them spelled, but you’re able to infer their spelling and spell them despite never having seen them before. This is because there are rules in your language governing the construction of words and you’ve learnt those in the course of your life, consciously or subconsciously. Just like language, music also has rules, and just like language those rules are more like principles or conventions rather than ‘laws which must be obeyed’, but people can and do learn them.

Helps it have more groove. You can also use it for lofi. For trap, simplicity is key but make sure your arrangement doesn’t get boring. A simple melody along with kick, clap/snare, hi hat, 808 and maybe <b><u>counter melody</u></b> should be enough to make a full beat but arrange it in a way that keeps the listener entertained. Add random fx/ percs throughout. Maybe do a breakdown with gross beat. Just make sure it doesn’t get boring.

The harmony is just a process, and getting caught up with creating perfect processes is a classic beginner composer's mistake. The goal of composition is to make music that sounds good, so just trust your ear. If it sounds good to you, it's the correct solution. You'll get a feel for how to accommodate melody, counter-melody, and harmony. You just need to do it a bunch.

A lot of the other responses to this thread are just being pedantic.

</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2018-12-23 06:01:11 EricZak<br>Nice mix and composition. I really like the feel you went after. My two cents:

\-I liked a lot of your synth instrument choices. Love the pads and arpeggios in a lot of places. Love the feel you're going for.

\-On first listen, I wasn't entirely sold that the rhythm and melody were working together in a pleasing way in the opening 30-60 seconds. When I listened to it again after hearing the beat it didn't stick out to me as much, but just something to consider. 

\-At about the 1:45 mark I was about to type "I wish there was more melody" here as I felt it was getting a little repetitive, but then of course a melody kicked in around the 2 minute mark and I enjoyed that moment. 

\-I felt like the melody that comes in  did start to feel a little repetitive after the first 8 bars. I really liked your chording choices but thought maybe either a counter-melody or more variation  in the lead pattern (like a build of some kind) would have helped the following 8 bars feel like the track was leading somewhere. It's on its way to a nice build with the way you keep adding subtle synth layers toward the end, but I suspect more melodic escalation might have a bigger impact.

\-I thought the end after the beat drops out was really pretty. I would listen to a whole track that had that sort of flavor. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-24 07:12:19 65TwinReverbRI<br>Still homophony.

Homophony can still be contrapuntal in origin, but it's something where one part (the melody) is "more important" than the rest. The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is still generally considered "not the main melody" so it still falls under the definition of homophony. Even in "melody with accompaniment" music, the "accompaniment" can still be comprised of lines and "melodic elements".

It's probably easiest to reserve Polyphonic to more specifically Polyphonic Counterpoint, like a Fugue, or obviously contrapuntal section etc.

The drop definitely sounds like there is stuff missing. The second drop added that nice plug at 1:53 which was interesting and improved it. The kick and snare can be much louder. Especially the kick. It can cut through that mix better. The sub could use some grit. Maybe use multiple growls to add variety or the dubstep version of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>?

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2018-12-27 04:43:31 nvduhn<br>This is really nice. The melodies are composed well. Very ambient and dark with that pad then the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> kicks in like something out of final fantasy. While everything is composed well, seems to sit in its own space on the mix and has nice effects on it, where I see room for improvement is on the velocity of your drums. Humanizing them will add a ton of variance and change the feel of them without changing the arrangement or mixing.

For example, your snares are nice but could benefit from having the last two snare notes be maxed out on the velocity to make them hit really hard. Itll add more emphasis to the end of the pattern and feel more natural like its played on a drum set with some emotion, not by someone trying to be perfect.

Hope that helps

It’s the tough answer but it is how it is. Most sounds are usually quite ambient in trap unless you’re purposely going for that dry type beat. When you’re making melodies, for the main melody with a bell or piano use big chords and little melody within it (going across like two/3 octaves which will give you a full sound) put it through gross beat adjust it a little bit and you got it, just add a simple <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on top.

Some trap beats can only have 1 main bell melody shoved through gross beat but it’s the mixing that’s makes it feel fuller so it makes me think it might be a mixing issue for you too.

Now, time for ~~trashtalking~~ contructive critique !

First, I know you probably don't have access to a studio, but on "for you", they are people talking and even laughting in the background. You should ask them to be quiet for six minutes, it's not that much. Or if they're jerks/people you don't know very well, you should wait for when they leave/record hoping they are doing a quiet activity

Secondly, I feel like your song lack a strong bassline. For your pianos one, it's understandable as it is only one instrument, but your multiple instruments one are too high pitched (maybe the bass is too weak, maybe there is none)

Thirdly, I largely prefer you two most recent songs, though I don't know if  it's because you improved or it's because your piano style isn't like your traditionnal rock style. Keep up the progression \^\~\^

&amp;#x200B;

Now, time to try to collab. I could write, play and record a cello bassline/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> for one of your song, as long as you provide me the tempo and the chord progression (or even better, the sheet for the other instruments). I have about 60 or 70 original pieces, mostly electronic, and have been writing for around 9 years.

I'm self taught too so I probably do it weird also:

I create the melody myself by playing around with the keys or something I was humming/whistling earlier, either that or I have a sample in mind that I want to use and I chop that up to what sounds good. 

Then I put in my drums, I pretty much feel for it. I listen to the melody/sample and literally feel what I think should go in place. So if I can hear 808s then I'll use them how I hear them, same with kicks, claps, snares, hats, etc.

Then I assemble it. This is usually 8 bars of the melody with light drums as a build up and then the kicks/snares and maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something, a small break with the lighter drums and main melody and then back to the main part of it and depending on the beat, there may be a break down at the end
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-04 01:07:26 KrazyFluffy1<br>It honestly up to preference. What I do and a lot of other producers do is make the melodies, chords, or pitched instrumentation first. The beat comes second. This helps me make sure the beat isn't too insane, allowing artist to use and rap over the beat. You still have to have enough melodies to make the beat interesting and not too busy. I start by making loop/chord progression that all pitches will be 'lead' by. I then go make a main melody, that will play for MOST (not all) of the beat, especially hooks. Then I make a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. It is important to find sounds that fit and match each other. I might add some pads or something else, just depends on how the beat sounds. I then add my Bass (not 808), usually a simple whole note lead bass pattern to add to the beat in the intro or hooks. I then make the drums. Starting with claps, snares and other sounding percs. Adding 808 rhythms, tuning them after i find something that fits well. Lastly I add hats, I don't like TayKeith style loud ass hats so I keep them under the rest of the beat. Then I lay the beat out with a 8 bar intro with tag. 4 16 bar verses, 3 8 bar hooks. then a 8 bar outro that fades out. This is how I go about it, it has really helped me make beats and continue making great ones. Hope this helps!

&gt;The first 20 seconds is one fugue set.  Starting at 32 seconds is the second.  These are super basic examples, but once you look for that pattern you'll find the prettier ones.

There is no such thing as a fugue set. More importantly, **the first 2:40 of the link you posted is the toccata**, a very nimble piece traditionally used as a sort of extended flourish to warm up a keyboardist’s (or sometimes a plucked string instrumentalist’s) hands. This evolved into more virtuoso preludes like in this famous Toccata and Fugue by Bach. 

The toccata being played here has an intro which is repeated with slight variation on different octaves of the keyboard (rather than the same thing transposed into different keys) and then not developed or set against any countermelody as the subject of a fugue would be, but just goes on with various interesting parts tacked together. 

The section from 1:11 starts off as though it could be a fugue subject, but we are still in the toccata here. The thing is that this little melody is not repeated in another key on top whilst the original part then provides a counter-melody (and so on). We just have this very flourishy melody sweeping up and down the keyboard before some other business with chords takes over. 

**The actual fugue itself starts from 2:40**, and though the subject’s style is quite similar to the section of the toccata starting at 1:11, notice that the part playing the original subject of the fugue morphs into a countermelody as the second voice enters playing the subject a fourth higher at 2:47. This plays out and we have short development section through a cycle fifths before ending back in a similar position but with another voice playing the subject an octave higher than originally, whilst the two melodies continue underneath it. This goes on a bit longer before a *fourth* voice comes in and the rest of the fugue is spent developing the original subject over these four separate but complimentary voices, being shared by the organists’ hands on the keys and their feet on the pedals for the lower notes.

The guitar and bass parts are really simple, but as you seem to be able to handle more complicated parts and are willing to write, you could modify the bass/guitar parts as you like, or even add a counter-melody (if you want, no forcing)
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-01-05 02:39:11 shanesaddlebags<br>So, after listening, the beat you linked has a very simple melody. And I mean very simple. It’s 4 notes all quarter notes and really only 3 unique notes since the 1st and 4th note are the same. Not a knock on simplicity at all because it can work sometimes. 

BUT. If your goal is to make beats less repetitive, make your lead melody more complex. Instead of looping the same bar over and over, make a 4 bar, an 8 bar, or even a 16 bar melody. Or you could keep this melody and then layer it with one or two more counter melodies with different instruments, rhythms, gross beat effects, etc. So maybe have this melody without gross beat, a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with half speed, and then a string pad playing some lower parts with the reverse effect. Or some combination of any of that.

I think using gross beat to switch things up probably isn’t the most effective thing to do, especially with melodies this simple. It’s pretty obvious that “oh this is just the same four notes but lower.” So, a better way to accomplish the switch up might be to add an instrument and also use half speed or another effect. 

One final note, beats will always be pretty repetitive. I mean, beats are just 8 bar and 16 bar loops that we’ve made and it’s always intro, verse, chorus/hook, verse, chorus/hook, repeat until end. This beat you’ve linked even with the very very simple melody might not even seem that repetitive of you had someone rapping on it. That would take the attention to the vocal instead of the lead part that’s there now.

Keep experimenting! Best of luck!

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-01-07 06:50:46 Leopawed<br>Thank you! Yeah, the tracks super repetitive because I just made a small sample of a melody I played on my guitar and converted it to piano, and didn’t make much of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for it to bridge anything or make a break from the main melody. Thanks for the ideas though, putting more into my percussion is what I’m really going to focus on next as well as working out sidechains! Do you mind linking any of your music for me to listen to? 
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-01-07 08:21:04 JasonKelliher<br>I like the piano at first, but it does go on a little long - and for what is the main staple of the track (and prominent in the mix) it feels a bit repetative after a while.

The "Arp" synth &amp; the autopanning percussion also needs to be mixed in a little better imo. If you drop the volume really low, its the main two things you can hear over everything else which means that it needs to be litened to loudly for everything else to be heard. some of the elements almost dissapear!

I like the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the "Drop".

Hope its helpful, but all in all i enjoed the track!

It's by the will of Eru that they find the ring, not the will of the ring itself - although much like Sauron laughing at and underestimating the hobbits, the ring itself may have perceived them as easy to dominate and drive at first. There is definitely some fate at work, even Gandalf noted it with Gollum.

I'd like to believe that they are the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> sung into the world by Eru to undo the evil of Melkor, being the youngest of the races of middle earth it would feel right and I believe would fit into Tolkien as a person.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-01-13 23:43:10 mp911de<br>There are three categories of things you can do (at least I have learned so far):

* Variations
* Effects
* Arrangement

# Variations

Variate rhythm, melodic elements, expression (such as velocity), dynamics across repetitions. You can add or remove to your parts such as adding an underlying bass playing the same notes, add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or remove (thinning out our sound) by removing instruments/layers that play.

Another form of variation is variations in the sound shape: Low-passing/high-passing, filter sweeping (aka opening/closing lowpass/highpass filters), changing characteristics of effects that you might have applied to your sound (e.g. automating delay/reverb parameters).

Whether and how much to change the melody or chords pretty much depends on the genre you're working in. Basically, do whatever you want to do but there are certain characteristics that work well in the genre you're working in.

# Effects

Did you realize how much is going on in a typical track of the genre you're working in? If not, then listen to a few tunes and listen for all the other things than melody. There are effects such as sweeps, swooshes, up- and down listeners, bass hits, zaps, vocal chops/vocal adlibs, tonal swells, percussive effects, white/pink noise, and much more that introduce unexpected turns in a track. Grab a track you like, put it on a separate track if you use a DAW and play it along with your own parts. That technique is called referencing and will give you a contextual view on what your track does vs your reference. You might want to adjust the reference track volume as commercial releases are typically loud/compressed as hell.

# Arrangement

I think this one is the most significant thing to do. Understand the song structure. Not only in terms of verse/chorus/break but also in terms of how your song evolves over time. Each song has its own story it tells and how it builds and releases tension. Music is about communication, expectation and moment of surprise, repetition, and variation. Build tension by adding variation, by dropping unexpectedly elements such as leaving out a note, a kick, adding effects, release tension by returning to a repetition or a variation of repetition.

&amp;#x200B;

These above are all examples I learned from doing trance so they might not be necessarily applicable to your genre. Also, that's just a small selection (at least I see it that way) and I suppose there is way more to say to this topic. I rightly recommend referencing, analyzing songs for the key elements that keep it interesting and to compare what's in your reference and what might be missing in your own song. Listen for how they are arranged, how transitions are made and how the tension builds and releases over time.

HTH.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-01-14 04:38:14 ultimate731<br>I like the reversed melody but I don’t like the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Maybe it’s because the sound selection I think you should choose something sounding less “cheap”. And you should layer it def 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-14 05:41:20 Uptowngrump<br>This is really good, especially considering you've only been doing this for 6 months. Here are my criticisms.

The bass sounds a little too wide, you might benefit from putting it closer to the center to the mix. rn it looks like the bass is taking up a lot of headroom in the mix but still lacking some of the driving force you seem to want it to have.

The melody could use some variation. Whether it's a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, melodic breaks, or whatever, that's your choice, but it needs some variation to keep it feeling fresh the whole way through.

But still, you're right to be proud, this is dope. I was not making stuff like this 6 months in, just shitty attempts at lofi, lol. keep up the good work, and if you have time check out this track I started yesterday. It's a bit weird, the time is in 11/4, but I'm taking it as a challenge to push myself.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-14 06:31:52 JEFFRON_LAKE<br>That was pretty cool you had a distinct vibe. I would have added some variation in pitch to the hi hats and maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-14 07:06:37 DestinyFaux<br>Thought about it but for how short it was and the intended style I didn't feel it was a make it or break it. I was listening to similar style beats and none of them changed up to much, the vocals were more or less the main dish. I think if I was to push it into the 2 or 3 minute territory I would've absolutely needed a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and some more fills etc.

Thanks for listening though!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-14 07:56:05 DestinyFaux<br>If it aint bass boosted is it even underground? lol 
But, in all seriousness though I match my levels against reference tracks, where it's sitting right now in the DB and lufs for the bass is where it should be for the genre. Which might not translate well across all listening devices, so it might sound louder on whatever you're listening on depending on the medium.

The melody is the fire temple chant looped and pitched, was considering a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> but for something that was only a minute long decided it wasn't crucial. With the right rapper it's likely you wouldn't notice the repetition. Thanks for listening though!

The main thing I noticed immediately with yours is the lack of vocal clarity. On headphones you fare a little better but over my studio monitors I can barely hear your voice, it gets ever worse on my soundbar. Which is sad because it sounds like you're probably spitting fire🔥 
</p></li><li><p><b>Composition</b> 2019-01-14 11:06:23 GatewaySwearWord<br>You gotta start by being able to come up with a melody. Then add some chords that support the melody. And then maybe add some <b><u>counter melody</u></b>/background parts. And then you have a song. 

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2019-01-14 11:40:09 fishbuttermilk<br>String Quartets are no easy business. I struggle with them, and I've been playing string instruments in a chamber setting for over a decade. Though, you have a lot of good ideas through this piece.

Firstly, theres a few small engraving "issues." No one on this subreddit would assume that this is how the piece would sound in a real life setting, and won't place merit on the playback of musescore's soundfonts. Many of us know how much of a bitch is it to get computer-generated audio to sound good. That being said, the note at the top is second-nature to any non-beginner players, and rather unnecessary. As well, the chords at the top give no extra information to players. My assumption is that they are just what you used as a quick-reference when writing. So, it's no big issue as long as it's not in the "final" sheet.

Now onto the actual critique. Considering the style that you have going on in this piece, the thing I feel that is missing most is structure. This sounds baroque-inspired, which had many different types of structures (rondo, sonata, etc.). However, this piece feels like it goes from A to B to C to E to F, and ends there. It gives a non sequitur sort of vibe. Older music was like poetry, it rhymed. So perhaps, take one of the themes you already have, and develop it into something that can return back into the piece at a later time.

As well, I wish there was more to each melody. To me, it feels like many sketches were taped together, with little transition between them. Flip your melodies around, put them over different chords, change their modes, give them to different instruments, change their rhythms—torture them until they tell you all of their secrets. I feel like by the time one of the melodies was reaching an exciting part, it ended and went onto the other part. Let the melodies grow, and have then flow into another idea.

Lastly, here's some advice on working with strings (specifically in a string quartet environment). If the first violin has the melody, let it have the melody. In measure one, the first obviously has the most important part, but then the second comes in with a counter-melody in measure 2. Though, it looks as though it's as important as the first's part, which I'm unsure if that was your intention. Strings are really good at blending in with each other, so one instrument is playing in the same range as another, it tends to sound "crowded." One easy fix would be to drop the second's part an octave lower, which would clear the confusion of who's "in charge."

Also, I feel as though the viola and cello are underutilized. Both are extremely versatile instruments with their own qualities that can (and arguably, should) be exemplified in a chamber setting like a quartet. An exercise to help improve this piece would be to give another instrument other than violins some melodic or "shining" moments. Also, it would be good to see how violins would do in an accompaniment sort of role.

My final thoughts would be to keep working on this piece, because there's a lot already in it, but there is a lot still to grow. My recommendation would be to listen to some quartets while reading scores. (If you need a place to start, go with Haydn, he was the father of string quartets). And don't be afraid to experiment with new chords/structures/sounds.

Thanks for you contribution to the sub! I look forward to hearing more from you.

Eg: Bass -&gt; Guitar -&gt; Violins.
Kick -&gt; Tom-&gt; Snare -&gt; Cymbal/Ride -&gt; Hihats.

Synthesizer Sounds (except bass) are similar to brass and string instruments. You have a specific instrument (different „patch“) for each octave.

You can copy that „rule“ to synthesizers. Low mid „lead“, upper mid „<b><u>counter melody</u></b>“.

The only way to learn how to write music is to learn music theory at a higher level than knowing how to build a scale and knowing a few chords on piano, because it's so much more than that. You have to put in the learning work to get better, and that includes classes/tutorials as well as practice.

Learn how to use the keys using applied theory (music theory is literally theory on how to build melodies, and how notes work together). Knowing keys is great and all, but it doesn't mean anything if you don't know how to build from that key. Music theory will teach you how to build chords from a key from scratch not outright knowing the name of them (for instance, triads are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of a root note in a scale, and 7 chords are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th), and how to build common progressions in whatever key you're writing in. Chords aren't something you just memorize chord-by-chord, as there's thousands of them, and only some of them work in whatever key you're writing in; for example, knowing how to play an F major chord can't really be applied to a song you're trying to write in F minor. From that, you can use things like modes, notes from chord inversions, and arpeggios to build melodies. For instance, if you're specifically going for a dark or angry sounding melody, you can use the Phrygian mode, and emphasize the root note of the scale in your chord progression, lead, and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

You're limiting yourself with your current music knowledge, and really just need to learn and practice more, simply put. Music theory is the language of music, and writing is difficult without knowing all of the basics of the language first. Writing melodies without theory is like trying to write a novel in a second language that you've only learned in one semester of school.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-18 01:38:07 TheToppa<br>I think the main issue in the first track is that it sounds really skeletal. Nothing is glueing the melody to the percussion. Add some ambient, uplifting synths that follow the base notes of the melody so you get some depth, adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is also an option.

Same issue with the same track, the melody is jammed in the mono field with the percussion so the stereo field is empty for most of the time.

I'd turn the reverb down a bit and also put some reverb on the clap - I think that'll go a long way towards tying stuff together.

I enjoy the main sample, although some sort of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would help out.

Structure wise it's fine, but I feel that the hats get kind of stale so maybe play around with different patterns.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-20 22:39:19 vapesensei<br>Try to create a little bit of contrast between them. If your first melody is something short and plucky, try some sounds that are a little more soft and smooth. Different textures coming in and out, even if the notes are very similar can bring a lot to a track. Also, you don't have to make a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> the full 4 or 8 bars of your original. The 2nd melody could just come in every other bar, or at the start/end of a loop.

In general, it's a safe move to have the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> moving in the opposite direction of the melody.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-01-21 01:45:59 are_those_real<br>I used to be this way but then learned how legends became legends. They knew their genre and their style so well that they were able to "break the rules" causing them to stand out. They weren't afraid of breaking it or failing because it was just something they had to do. It's good to have dreams and aspirations but you need to have some goals and be loving and kind to yourself on your way there. 

I've been bless to work with evolutionary producers and watch them work. For many of them it's just a feeling but also knowing their instrument/DAW/plugins/chords so well that they're able to get complex sounds and effects doing something simple.

I was making super complex music with multiple layers and trying to put more classical elements into my music and it sounded like shit even though it was all correct. So I took the basics from classical music. I love the builds, the complexity of it, but it all starts from something basic. Melody, <b><u>Counter melody</u></b>, bass, and harmonies. So instead of trying to start off complex I started building. That workflow has made my music a lot better. It's about finding your workflow and being kind to yourself that it doesn't start off amazing but will end up there.

The dream is to make a change, but you can't make change if you don't know how to build it on a strong foundation. The basics and rules are there for a reason, if you learn the why you can learn how to bend it and mold it to where you want it to go. Each legend started off with something simple and then added or removed from it. So set limits and force yourself to think creatively within those limits. Then add or remove those limits.
</p></li><li><p><b>HipHopCollabs</b> 2019-01-21 06:59:00 JakeTompkins<br>Really good. Just one thing is that I would add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and maybe some more FX to give it more of a variety instead of just a loop that goes for a while.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-01-21 07:06:01 Kradstus_Athene<br>I would think a plucked instrument for the main melody and a woodwind instrument for the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, then a distorded 808 with fast drums

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-01-21 11:00:47 65TwinReverbRI<br>The better musical term for it is an Ostinato Figure.

You know, using the word "counterpoint" is maybe a little too academic.

For example, "For Your Love" by The Yardbirds has a bass line that goes E - G - A - A and a melody part that goes E-D-C#-C at the same rate.

These parts are "in counterpoint" but it's not a "contrapuntal piece".

IOW, we don't really use the word counterpoint to describe any time there happens to be one note in one part moving against another note in another part - if we did, everything would be counterpoint.

It's kind of like calling everything with Noodles "Pasta" - Ok, on some level they are,  but we have more specific terms like Spaghetti, or Lasagna, or Macaroni and Cheese.

So this Ostinato figure does create counterpoint with some other things some times, but it's all kind of happenstance rather than thought through and composed that way - compared to a "Contrapuntal" piece like a Fugue.

Pretty much, if it's pop music, it's unlikely to have any "real" counterpoint in it. There will be "counterpoint" by the strictest definition of the word in pretty much everything, but pieces that are primarily or exclusively "contrapuntal" are pretty rare (outside of some subset of parts, or in decidedly classically influenced music like prog rock - you know, the vocal section of Bohemian Rhapsody for example).

We're far more likely to find "<b><u>Counter Melody</u></b>" and things like that - for example, in one of the breaks in "Silly Love Songs" by Wings, there are a couple of voices doing different things all at the same time - this is "more contrapuntal" by combining a melody with a couple of counter melodies.

To put is simply, looking for "counterpoint" in pop songs is not the place to be looking for it. It's the exception, rather than the rule, which is "Homophony" - Melody with Accompaniment.

But it is a "continuum" to some degree - there's a little counterpoint in everything, to a lot in some things in pop.

But if you brought this into a class as an example of Counterpoint, it wouldn't be the best choice.

As for pop songs with Ostinato figures like that - pretty much everything. It's rampant. Ostinato is a much more common device in pop music.

I really like your sound selection for the melodies, especially enjoy that <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that plays around 0:40 - 1:02. Nice.

</p></li><li><p><b>assassinscreed</b> 2019-01-21 21:31:23 ToodlyPipster<br>I think every version has its merits, and it is always interesting hearing different composers' different interpretations of the song and how they try to convey the setting. If I were to try to pick a favourite, though, I'd first say the original Renaissance version. There is such an emotional strength, and confidence, to it, but it is also the most beautiful, and heartwrenching rendition, I feel. After a few seconds of reminiscing about the other versions, I'd then say the Origins version. Even without the vocals, it manages to come closer than any other version to capturing that tragedy and that emotional punch. And after a few more seconds, I'd say the Odyssey version, with combative, adventurous tone. A bit more, and I'd say the Syndicate version, with its unique counter-melody and softer, more contemplative sound. And I'd keep changing my mind until I've said every version is my favourite. 

Except Rogue's. I can't pin exactly why, but it, like almost all of Elitsa Alexandrova's soundtrack for that game, just does not rub me right. It's trying to replicate the sound of the original, but it is hollow, and distant, lacking any of the emotional pull. Maybe that's the point, considering the game it's attached to.

</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2019-01-22 05:38:46 Josquin_TheMan<br>So follow up question: in typical string quartets do the violins work like sopranos and altos where one typically gets the higher part and one gets the lower, or is it more like v1 typically gets melody and v2 gets <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or harmony? 

Like let’s say I’m writing a choral piece with a melody and a descant. Altos for sure would get the melody and sopranos the higher part, would it typically happen the same way for a quartet?
</p></li><li><p><b>MusicCritique</b> 2019-01-23 01:18:10 JasonKelliher<br>I have a few concerns, but ill start with the main one.

The main bell synth along with the hat / drum loop is out of time, almost like the attack on the synth is too slow. It feels like its tripping up over itself, its very strange!

Also looking at the wave form you can see that it is at its peak 99% of the time. Tracks require a good break from time to time so we dont fatigue. Don't feel the need to push the bass out ahrd from the very start, it maes the track feel a lot less dynamic! This would also help with the build up and a the drop part, as at the the moment is more of a "Fall" than a drop.

The Mix:

The pad that is played from the intro could do with some EQ, the kick also (i would cut the low end 40hz) and turn down the hats.

Arrangement:

The track could really do with some sort of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to play along side the main bell line so its not the only thing we can listen to. I noticed some other things, like the bass synth (around the mid range) playing the same 3 notes over and over, i would do that for 8 bars and for the next 8 change it up a little every so slightly.

E.g. 1----1----2--3-- &lt;--- First 8 bars 1----2----3--4-- &lt;--- Second 8 bars. (if that makes sense!)

Overall i didn't enjoy the piece as a Dance / EDM track, because it's hard to find a rhythm and its hard to ACTUALLY dance to it.

I did enjoy the pad &amp; synth sounds, and i could see it actually benfiting from not having the Dance / EDM tag and more of an ambient progressive track. Perhaps some nice solo intruments or piano lines and subtle percussion!

I like producing in minor keys. I like playing chords that are really slow and melancholy underneath all of the faster elements. I also use higher pitched notes sparingly as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, usually spaced pretty far apart filling the voids with copious reverb. Distorted lows, “uncomfortable” foley as well. I like foley sounds like glass breaking, creaks, ice being swirled in a glass of whiskey, etc
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-23 14:54:41 MickMain<br>Its a good start my but it needs more work, mainly on the mixing side try and work more on those drums and bass to bring them forward in the mix so they play nicely with that sample.

I don't think the 808 hits hard enough, but I'm just listening on my laptop. I like the dark melody you got going and the horn type deal in the background contrasting it but I feel like if you messed with it a bit more changed it up or added more/louder/longer <b><u>counter melody</u></b> it would really make it sound good but thats imo again.

So when every instrument is playing at once, you need more violins than any other instrument to make sure they're loud enough to be heard. This is important because violins are important in the sound of an orchestra. Violins usually get the melody, so they need to be heard.

In addition, you'll have groups of each instrument playing different things. One group of violins may be playing one melody, a second group a counter-melody, and so on. So you need enough instruments to cover all the different things they're supposed to do and be loud enough. Since violins are usually important in the pieces the orchestra plays and they're relatively quiet, this means you need a lot of violins.

That said, you’ve specifically invited comments on “general composition”, so in my own opinion...

1. Some of the voicings could be better. Don’t double the 3rd in a chord if possible, and the voice leading seems a bit “blocky” and parallel. The way you distribute the notes could be more sonorous I think. Try “drop two” voicing, which is taking the second note from the top of a chord and putting it down the octave to spread the chord wider. 

2. Try going to unison at times, especially at the start, then split to harmony for dramatic effect. 

3. Try adding a bit more <b><u>counter melody</u></b>? It’s all kinda blocked out with everyone moving together en masse. Try one person holding a long note or something while the other parts move, or maybe have a longer <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that arches over the block chords. 

Just some thoughts! Keep it up anyway, nice one.

</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2019-01-29 05:48:21 turkeypedal<br>Since you can already vamp, it sounds like you might like an active method, where you play on top and write it down. I think it's useful to learn the melody, not to play along with the singer, but so you have the song internalized. 

Instead, use that to help you figure out some little echos and fills to play when they aren't singing. You may also want an intro or outro where you do play the melody for a bit, and you may want to occasionally play the melody for emphasis, but otherwise just give them the notes to start with.

Then there's playing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. You have to keep it out of the way of the regular melody, making it sound more like you're harmonizing with the melody, or singing a background vocal. 

Oh, and record what you do, so you can go back and find parts you liked and didn't like. Ideally be able to record it separately to the singer, though also have a recording of the singer to mess around with. It may be easier to experiment without the singer there, and you can spend more time on it. 

If you plan to write it down, see if you can record it into your piano or computer as MIDI, as that can help you with the final writing. 

This isn't the only way to do it, of course, but it's a way I've used, and I thought it might be helpful, since you've gotten no replies as of yet.

There are some really cool sample chops in here, but I would focus on one main one and then a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to switch it up.

Maybe throwing isotope vinyl on there and adding some texture to it would remind me more of boom bap, but honestly not much to critique. Also maybe another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to come in half way through the verse, but all in all a good track 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-30 16:43:52 GregoryBennettMusic<br>Hey! So I’ll give some nitty gritty kind of feedback that may be helpful for you. A lot of this is subjective but hopefully it’ll give you some stuff to think about

To start, the lead arp needs to be compressed more. The attacks are very “pointy” and jump out of the mix too much. If you are worried about bringing the reverb out too much with compression then use s multi band and get it right on the leading frequency. Should be easy to find with it being a very digital synth. 

The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> synth is kind of thin. Between that and it being really high pitched it sticks out a lot. I would maybe rethink that sound or take it down an octave. 

The beat switch is really abrupt and feels like it comes out of nowhere. I think if you were going to do something different from a creative standpoint this is where I would look. 

Hope some of this is helpful! 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-30 23:05:40 prodbymurahari<br>yo I'm feeling it, reminds me a lot of Rainbow Six off of Veteran. personally, I think the main thing you should consider is a higher <b><u>counter melody</u></b>--unlike in rainbow six, your vocal sample is lower and not as engaging, so I think a higher register synth ditty or something would help keep ears interested. other than that, play around with some bitcrushing/distortion--imo, the track is a little too clean until near the end. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-30 23:24:24 prodbymurahari<br>thanks for the feedback bro, it's definitely a bit on the dissonant side lol

as for yours, I think it's generally a solid vibe, but could use a good bit of work on the mixing side. your low end is pretty muddy, the clap snare and hats don't have enough high end presence and the mix could use some separation. your melody is also a good starting point, but I'd bring it up higher (both in pitch and the mix) or add a higher up <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, as it's just not very engaging rn. a pretty solid start though, with lots of potential
</p></li><li><p><b>Clarinet</b> 2019-01-31 01:20:13 toastyghostie<br>So it's most common for people to start on soprano clarinet and then pick up bass/alto/etc. but you don't have to follow that. Things that you should consider are how readily available bass clarinets are in your area to rent/buy depending on how you want to get your hands on one, if you're going to be able to move around a bulky bass case or want to stick with the smaller soprano case, and what kind of music you want to play. And by music, I mean whether you want to be playing a lot of melody or if you prefer to be doing counter-melody/bass lines. Bass clarinets also sometimes get melody lines and have to learn how to do a lot of quick fingering, but not as often as sopranos.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think there's much a difference if you learn soprano or bass first, as the fingerings are mostly the same. The embouchure is different between the two and you need different amounts of breath support, so there's going to be a bit of a learning curve either way.

&amp;#x200B;

For what its worth, I started on soprano clarinet because my family already had one, but I picked up bass clarinet in college for a clarinet quartet and really loved it. I still stick with soprano clarinet mostly because that's what I own, but I'd love to invest in my own bass clarinet someday.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-01-31 02:14:52 zeolmusic<br>Thanks for the advice first of all, but unfortunately it's not so much about the quantization or swing. I am used to adjusting timing and 50% quanti, and use it already.
It's just when I want to emphasize on the percussion a bit more.

Others get their percussion and especially hats to act like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, so that it's complimenting your synths/samples. Mine just sound off and it's even worse when i try to mix it. 
It doesn't smoothen out my track and is rather polluting the vibe. 


I know this is practice, but I don't even know where to start..

really liked the vibe of your track, great sound selection. my personal favorites were the percussions, they worked well, the song has a nice groove thanks to the perc patterns. the bassline is also dope. if I were you, I would try experimenting with some vocal chops to create a counter-melody for the second half of the track. keep up the good work!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-01 02:23:44 MayoStaccato<br>Follow the scale as your initial melody, write your counter in a different octave (to taste) and make sure the the note lengths are different. Meaning: if you're lead is primarily a flurry of eighth notes, consider making your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> just half notes with the occasional quarter not throw in. If your lead is just a few full notes/half notes, thrown in a sixteenth note arpeggio as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Season to taste

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-02-01 20:27:09 Kimantha_Allerdings<br>Listen to a lot of music.  And I don't mean "listen to what you like", I mean "listen outside your comfort zone".  Seek out jazz, and bluegrass, and boogie-woogie.  Find songs from the 1920s.  Listen to classical music.  Listen to atonal experimental music.  Go to Spotify, type in a random word or couple of words (like "cardboard box" or "flip") and listen to whatever random songs that turns up.  Find a death metal album and listen to that.  Start listening to gospel.  Consume 60s psychedelia.  Go through the music collections of parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc.

Find the music that inspired the kind of music that you want to make (so, for example, if you want to make Dubstep, start listening to 2-step).  Then find the music that that inspired *that* and start listening to that (from 2-step to UK Garage).  And so on, all the way back to Delta blues and folk and beyond (although, obviously, once you go back a certain amount of time you'll not be able to find original recordings and will have to rely on more modern musicians recreating old music).

Listen to music from other cultures.  Traditional Japanese music.  Bollywood songs.  African hip-hop. Peruvian folk.  K-pop.

Listen to it all, and pay attention to everything it's doing and why.  What kind of chord progressions are there?  What's the bass doing?  Is there an interesting counter-melody?  How is the song structured? Are the vocals doing anything that you're not used to hearing?  And so on.  

For those for which it's applicable, listen to the production.  What's good about it?  What's bad about it?  What would you do differently if you were the producer?  Is there anything you'd never have thought of to do?

Listen to it all and try to learn as much from it as you can.  Anything you like, steal (and I don't mean "sample", I mean take the idea and make it your own).  Even more than stuff you want to steal you should find stuff that makes you think "that's quite a good idea, but it'd be better if it went like *this*", or "that's almost good, but I could make it much better".  Absorb as many different and diverse sources as you can, and try to learn from each one - even if it's just what not to do.

You'll be a better musician for being more knowledgeable and having a wider range of influences.  And you'll be certain to find stuff that you like that you'd never have dreamed that you would and never would have encountered otherwise, so you'll be better off even outside the parameters of making music.

There's a decent arts program, which is mostly funded through fundraising. They do really awesome musical theatre productions, and it's not Beal, if that narrows it down for you.

I was in band, orchestra, and guitar, and the bass clarinet i used was so old and broken that it wouldn't stay on it's stand- it would slip around. Which SUCKS because while, yes, it is a bass instrument, because of it's range it occasionally plays the harmonies, or the counter-melody. So I could barely play, and I'm already pretty fucking shit at it, and I almost failed my final because of that stupid goddamn clarinet.

You've got  a sick ass song here!! Really well mixed and arranged!!
My humble opinion is that your bassline could use some distortion  (it sounds like a clean sine wave) and that it'd be wise to start adding a counter-melody or other switchup when you've got a beat that starts going past 3 minutes

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-04 02:47:11 SpecialDistribution<br>thanks for the feedback man!

your beat is pretty sinister man, I like it. The turntable effects at :48 are a pretty neat switch up too. The progression is pretty nice too, I thought the melody would stay the same but the slight change in the second half is nice and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is good too. good job!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-04 02:58:05 norman1992<br>This is dope man. Only two things I’d say is that the bass and drums could do with being turned up just slightly, especially the snare, and I really love that main melody but it runs the risk of being a bit repetitive if it doesn’t change up or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is introduced. Apart from that, I love the groove and, whilst the melody is cold as ice, the vinyl crackle warms it up— a nice touch. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-02-04 08:57:16 TomSerb<br>A melody note is a melody note.  In composition, chords are then chosen to support the melody note.  In improvisation, melody notes are chosen to fit over an existing chord structure.

The melody note can be a 3rd or 7th, but it can also be a root or 5th (or 9th, 11th, or 13th).  And it can be a *non-harmonic tone*, one that doesn't belong to the chord at all - it can be a passing note between chord tones, a neighbor tone (where the melody moves from a chord tone to an adjacent note and then back to the chord tone), an appoggiatura, or an anticipation of the *next* chord.  These are all really, really common in jazz (*and* other genres).

The bass note is the bass note.  It's the lowest sound being played.  It's often the root or fifth, but it can be any chord tone, and it can also be a non-harmonic tone.  Jazz is full of 'walking bass' lines that have non-harmonic tones.

The vast majority of the time instruments do NOT play the same note.  That's true in all genres - if it wasn't, all arrangements would be about as interesting as an acapella rendition of "Happy Birthday".

And this statement:

&gt; even counter melodies are usually the same note! 

makes no sense at all.  A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is a melody that runs *counter to the main melody* \- if it's the same notes there's nothing counter about it, it's simply in unison.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-02-04 09:58:19 TomSerb<br>So can I.  I'm not sure what that has to do with anything, though.

I just did a quick test of your counter-melody theory.  I pulled out Bach's "Invention No. 1" which is just 22 measures long.  Of the 21 downbeats (the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is tacet for the first two beats), the two melodies have the same note in three of them (one of which is the last measure, where you'd expect it, and one has the counter-melody resting for a sixteenth before playing the same note the main melody played on beat 1).  

So that's 3 out of 21.  Under 15%.  Pretty far from "usually" playing the same note.  Add in the beat 3s and you get 4 of 42, which is less than 10%

The downbeats are 3 unisons, 6 3rds, 1 4th, 3 5ths, 1 tritone, and 7 6ths.  So like I said, they're rarely dissonances (just one in this piece) and you'll have more 3rds and 6ths than unisons, 5ths and octaves (13 imperfect consonances to 4 perfect consonances).

This is going to hold true for pretty much any counter-melody.  It's basic counterpoint: use more imperfect consonances than perfect ones (which includes unisons/octaves).  That's been taught since at least Zarlino back in the 1500s.

you could use a better counter-melody and sound choice then the choir you had going but the main melody you have is very catchy and as good as it gets when laying a foundation

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-05 21:16:35 UnflushableLog9<br>One thing I've learned over my years of producing hip hop beats is to know the difference between when a beat *actually* needs something more or just *sounds* like it does because it simply doesn't have vocals.

A finished beat that is ready for an artist **should** feel like it has something missing. It does. The artist.

Many producers will think this emptiness is a result of them not putting enough into the beat, whether it be an additional <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, drums/percs, effects, whatever. As a result, they jam pack their beats with sounds, and when it gets to the artist, anything they do on the beat sounds cluttered because they have no room on the track.

Listen to some of the biggest hits in hip-hop. A large percentage of them are made from 4-6 sounds MAX. Even the more complex-sounding songs often when broken down, are just 4-6 sounds arranged in a way that makes the song sound full.

Jam packing your beats with melodies and effects is only going to impress other amateur producers making the same mistake as you. Sure, it's good to show off your production skills with a intricate instrumental, but if you want placements, if you want to actually make *good songs,* for goodness sake, *leave room on the track for the artist!*

I really like your beat, that bass is hard asf, i would've maybe liked a harder hitting snare though. melody is fire though and i love the sound selection, plus the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is dope. i really liked the progression too, i was interested throughout the whole beat. that choir is a great touch too, awesome job man.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-07 12:19:18 SpecialDistribution<br>certainly an interesting melody, not sure i'm too into it, maybe that's just the sound itself. i would agree the drums don't quite match the beat, the clap should happen less often so you get more of a groove going. the 808s sound like they're playing into each other, you can avoid that by going to misc functions in the channel settings and setting polyphony to 1 I believe, or messing with the envelope. I don't think a :59 song really needs a switch up or anything, maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, but it would only need a bridge or whatever if you made it longer.
</p></li><li><p><b>drumline</b> 2019-02-07 12:57:09 tj_burgess<br>I saw this post days ago and wanted to comment but didn't have time and then I just forgot about it....

&amp;#x200B;

A few people have mentioned this already but I wanted to try and explain it a bit differently to maybe help you understand what they are talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

Rhythmically the parts are basically identical through the whole thing. Think of playing the theme to Star Wars on your trumpet. Now add in the entire brass line playing the same exact theme.... Now ask yourself if having a few sections or even having the 2nd and 3rd trumpets playing different notes of the chord might make the theme sound better? What about changing the parts of the low brass to the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>? With a few changes to the brass arrangement you can completely change the feel of the song from a boring, basic unison melody to one of the most amazing pieces of music ever written.

&amp;#x200B;

Now think of drum line music in the same sense. Playing unison can be a powerful statement but if everything is in unison it gets really old, really quick. Even small changes can make a big difference. If the snares are playing four quarter notes, write the tenors playing dotted 8th 16th notes under neath it. Bass drums playing 16th 8th 16th note pattern under that. You want to think of rhythms the same way you think of chords and counter melodies with brass music. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does that make sense at all?

For every quote someone tries to find, there is another quote that just doesn't corroborate that statement. 

&gt;  LOTR by Howard Shore only had such great motif reuse because Shore didn't have time to create new motifs with how close the movies were going to be released after another.

I'd like a source on this. There are between 8-12 distinct motifs throughout each film. Most of the major characters, cities, and scenery has it's own, very often as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to one another.

&gt; At some point you need a deadline. Otherwise you'll never finish anything.

A deadline cannot *force* creativity, that's my point. If you already have a concept, it could maybe get you to the point of reaching a state that a label or publisher is happy with, but how many artists are happy with released work? Skrillex even said of his KH track that he wishes he could have changed it, but they called it done for him over a year ago.

It wasn't finished, at least in his eyes, he simply ran out of time on the project because he was forced into a deadline. Every artist HAS to work with deadlines, that doesn't not breed creativity, that just means you give up on the project by a set date.

There is the instrumental in the middle though where the vocal melody is played in a different instrument and juxtaposed with the harmonica melody which I would consider an example of counterpoint, so that part would be polyphonic (though it's only 2 so I'm not sure it could be called poly, maybe duo would work as a prefix?).

And I Love Her - I'd say mostly homophonic.  The guitar part could be argued as being a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> due to its prominence, but I feel it's mostly just a harmony part since it seems to just play the chord tones in a repeating pattern.

Things We Said Today - Homophonic, notable for not just being homophonic as a song overall, but also having homophonic vocal harmony at parts.

Also disclaimer these are by know means authoritative opinions, they're just my best guesses based on what I heard.

I really like acoustic sounds and don't want a trap 808 on most tracks, but it's hard to find something that sounds like what I want. And thanks for the compliment on the mix man, I never really learned off youtube or anything, just playing with EQ and compressors until it sounds good, so it means a lot that it actually sounds good to someone else.

Nice track man, I love how dynamic the bass makes it, the main synth melody is very cool, and the mix keeps you engaged with the clicks and background repeated notes. There isn't much changing like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> ect. but it would be a really cool track for someone to rap over without the production being super in your face.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-11 03:05:55 Gambitz7<br>So I would give you feedback but it sounds really good lol. The only thing I would suggest is maybe a little keys/synth creeping <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at a certain point but yea...good shit
</p></li><li><p><b>synthesizers</b> 2019-02-11 07:12:04 AshleyPomeroy<br>I recently bought a Behringer Model D and I decided to test it out. This track is a cover of MdrMx, one of the best songs from Brothomstates' classic 2001 album Claro, made entirely with the Model D. I picked that tune because it's really simple. The original song has a counter-melody, buy I didn't want to slavishly imitate the original.

Brothomstate's original is delicate and has floaty space noises, mine is much less subtle and has louder but simpler drums. Workflow-wise I recorded the song with software instruments in Logic Express 9 running on a Power Macintosh G5 - it works - and then gradually replaced the software instruments with Model D patches until only the Model D was left.

There are only four patches. The bass is a typical Moog-style bass, doubled with sync'ed delay. The lead noise is a sawtooth with a very quiet sine two octaves up, which gives it a bit of tinkle. Wouldn't it be great if the individual oscillators had ADSR envelopes? The synth would be much more expensive though.

In the past I've usually thought of oscillators as a way of doubling the sound but the Model D almost forces you to mix the oscillators carefully, because they're fat enough already. The countermelody is a similar patch run through a wobbly Leslie, and the "strings" in the background are swamped in reverb.

On the whole I prefer my Korg Odyssey, because the synth engine is more flexible. The Moog really benefits from playing with the controls live, which makes me wonder why Behringer don't sell a keyboard version as well. I wish they'd put in a standard ADSR envelope. It's killer value for £260 though, which I what I paid. As I've said before it's a good cheap way of adding some analogue sounds to a DAW setup.

As before I did have to warm up the Model D before it settled in tune. My setup has tonnes of noise if I hook it up with USB (when I move the mouse I hear a digital crinkling sound); I had to use a MIDI interface instead to keep the noise down. I used a Mark of the Unicorn 2408 audio interface. It would be great if the Model D had a balanced out but perhaps they're holding that back for the model two.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-11 12:19:36 Fatty_Yogurt<br>The melody should be changed up more throuout the song. Its needs a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. And a few more sound efects. The 808 pattern isnt very interesting and could be changed because i dont feel like the beat is thicc enough unless it was made for a rapper who likes lots of extra space.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-11 21:16:48 ArvidCS<br>Add compression to the violin and turn the volume up. The beat feels empty. A counter-melody and some chords would fit well. Layer the snare with a snare that has a lower pitch. Maybe add a bell that plays the same melody as the violin. Reverb and delay would also be good to fill out the track. Be creative and try adding different elements and see if it fits. The vibe is good and it sounds like something the old Suicideboys would've done.

If you feel the need to add more to this piece then I would recommend some conservative additions, because your track is already very musically full and engaging, so you don’t want too much taking the listeners away from the complexity of the composition. But here’s what I would try incorporating:

1. Cinematic percussion. Add in a few one-shot trailer drum hits to help build and maintain energy. Maybe near the end in your last high energy section you can add some regular beat keeping hits, but adding too much will basically make your track a trailer (go for it if that’s what your going for, though). Also make these drum hits high reverb with some 1/4 or 1/8 note delay to add to the soundscape. 

2. More bass. You have certain sections that need bass balance as it is a little mid to high heavy throughout. Add in some dramatic cello and/or double cello lines to really boost the dramatic nature of your track. 

3. Try adding some string ostinatos, or swap the musical roles of the piano and strings. Basically, have the piano hold the chords and the strings play the arpeggiated line in certain sections near the end where you’re trying to build more energy. 

4. Add a counter-melody with some woodwind orchestral instruments to add more engaging musical motifs. 

5. Try adding some harp one-shots near transitional points between sections.

I think you’re off to a good start, the melody has a nice motivic/rhythmic consistency. I would say your next step would to be to animate the left hand with a little bit of <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. You can still highlight the chords, just give them a little bit of melodic direction too. I find that this could be most effective when the right hand has a rest or break. So the right hand does a thing and rests, and then the left hand could then respond with a melody of its own to fill up the space. 

I might also ask if you are planning on writing for a much larger ensemble because there are a lot of empty staves underneath the piano. 

I hope this helps! 
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-02-12 11:24:12 AaronicProductions<br>To get that cinematic sound, I think your pad at the beginning could use a bit more low-mid sound to round out the spectrum. However, once everything else kicks in, that problem disappears. Maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> could help? Love the sound design at 1:45. The drop at 2:25 came out of nowhere in a good way. This whole track reminds me of Moby's downtempo, cinematic stuff which is awesome. Excellent job!

sorry bout the late reply, got caught up w work.
Bruh no hate but like the mood of your track doesnt gel well with the vocals. Like your beat is warm but your flow's a lil too cold for it to sound cohesive , ykw im saying.
About the beat, its kinda repetitive... but yeah i get it.. its just preference since you're rapping on it too. Try adding better kicks and bass to your beats. The melody is  clean, try adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and some top notes and bass notes to make it sound full.
Hope this helps you somehow.

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-02-15 05:16:23 ZaqueDidIt<br>I find my main melody and once I get it sounding exactly how I want it I move onto my hats. After that I find a good <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and then do my drums and percussion once that’s all good I do my 808’s last. It’s just the best way for me to work but everyone has their own way of working so 
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-02-15 19:48:53 AvegoMusic<br>it takes a lot of practice. as far as the counter melodies thing go generally your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> should be between 5 and 7 steps up or down from your melody and it should generally follow the same patern as well. as far as blending instruments go start eqing them but keep them all on so you can hear how the eqing sounds in the total mix
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-02-15 21:45:42 JesusSwag<br>The whole point of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is that it doesn't follow the same pattern as the main melody.

A common practise is to (generally) have your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> go up the scale as your main melody goes down, and vice versa.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-02-16 01:11:48 NotFalco11<br>this!! even just adding notes(not even a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>) up or down octaves can make your chords sounds fuller
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-02-16 01:40:43 noaniemusic<br>Writing a good <b><u>counter melody</u></b> can take shape in a bunch of different ways. You can change the pitch, rhythm and direction of the line to help it stand out. So you can either change just one of these things or all of them. If you're going to keep the rhythm the same, then it becomes very important that the notes either use contrary motion (moving in opposite directions of each other) or oblique motion (where one line moves and the other remains on the same pitch) to maintain some sort of independence. Otherwise, it's a harmony, not a counter-melody. A question you need to ask yourself is "how much importance do I want to give this counter line?" Should it be equally as noticeable as the main melody or should it be tucked away a little and provide more of an added feel without being outwardly noticeable unless you really listen for it?

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest piece of advice would be to still try and make your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> as catchy as your main one, even if it wont be that noticeable in your mix because it's still a "melody" not just something to take up space.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're looking for something to fill out inner voices and your frequency spectrum then that's one thing. But a true counter-melody really should have melodic merit all on its own.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-16 03:41:37 MessyBeatz<br>Defo keep this. The melody is perfect, maybe re-work the whole drums and throw in another <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-16 22:13:39 TheToppa<br>Really unique beat, personally I wasn't a fan of the choppy intro but besides that, everything in terms of arrangement sounds great. I think your snare has too much high-end on it. The hi-hats seem too filtered, loosen up the HPF to bring some body into the hats. Melody is really dope, reminds me of some Crash Bandicoot type stuff. I like the swap in melody as well, I was just about to type how the sound you were using was getting boring but you did a good job with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. I would also add some movement to your snares/hi-hats, what I mean by this is to pan some of the hits. You can expand them into the stereo field just give you track some bounce. Everything else sounds good!

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a track I dropped recently, I tried to go with a different vibe. Let me know if you're feeling it!

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-02-17 06:41:38 AugustusMusic<br>This is pretty nice. I think the bass sounds great in there. Really wide big sound. Pretty catchy little melody, but I do think you could switch it up as it is a bit repetitive. Maybe bring a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in quicker with just a small change in things/instruments to keep it fresh. 
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-02-17 07:30:49 _noIdentity<br>You have a ton of interfering frequencies throughout the track. I would work on eqing each element and giving it some space.

&amp;#x200B;

I love the bassline idea, with the chants, I think the chants need to be a little louder. Good sound choices.

&amp;#x200B;

Although that "I can't stop this feeling deep inside of me" vocal sounds like its either out of key, or might just be a really distorted file. 

&amp;#x200B;

The mix in the drop, with the drums and everything sounds pretty good, around 2:20 I would boost that <b><u>counter melody</u></b> up more, seems like its fighting to pop into my speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

Great idea, I would just keep trying to mess with the dynamics of each sound, maybe experiment with some panning as well to give it space.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-18 18:36:31 King_Kunto<br>Hey bro,

first off, I really dig the glitchy turn-table effect you've put on the melody; I think it suits the vibe perfectly. The drum mix seems really nicely attached together as well. Personally I want to hear another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in possibly the higher frequency range, seeing as the main melody is quite low in level. If you want to just stick with the one melody, the 808 bass seems to just be dominating that in terms of attention of the listener. Unfortunately, there isn't *MUCH* interesting about a some-what melodic 808 bassline; let the melody do its thing - turn it up! Those are the only suggestions I have.

Check out mine if you can and let me know what you think: [https://soundcloud.com/kingkunto/mensrea/s-Uqo7c](https://soundcloud.com/kingkunto/mensrea/s-Uqo7c)
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-19 03:36:58 VELO1714<br>I think the guitar and your chorus comes in too aggressive. If you began the song with a bit of rap/spoken word over those drums. And I like the guitar/bass (?) on the verses much better than what's on the hook. Could maybe use a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on the hook, but I can see the practice in minimalism here so maybe that was a choice you guys made. Good work overall though!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-19 13:09:47 Bluetorch_hmm<br>Relistening I noticed you do switch up the melody a bit, but its subtle. I like it when beats add or remove something for the hook like a bassline or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. It makes the structure of the beat clearer. Thats just my preference tho. You kinda already do that with the kicks and the hats and it probably wont matter much once a rapper hops on it and does their thing.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-19 15:40:01 OldeMusic<br>I like the vibe of it but I feel like you could turn it up a notch by havin some more versatility, some more chords to the main melody n maybe using the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> a bit earlier or adding a third melody as well for some of the earlier parts 

You could also add some more versatility to the drums I feel like, maybe adding some closed high hats for some parts to fill it a bit more 

Good vibe tho, nice work mane
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-02-20 09:31:19 TheDay-manFighteth<br>This is dope man very creative, I would turn that main synth up a bit in the mix and like others have said would add another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> halfway through to keep it fresh.

I thought the structuring on the drums could have been better, you shoulda had the 808 and kick hit together periodically throughout the song rather than just at the end. The melody could also use a switch up somewhere, its mad cool but you should bring in a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> somewhere!

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-02-24 04:53:08 emilio8x<br>That sounds like an avenger soundtrack. I have no idea what a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is... I still have a lot to learn...
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-02-24 05:22:55 Sleutelbos<br>A counter-melody is a 'less important' melody played against the primary melody. Historically there was a period when playing multiple melodies against each other was the absolute essence of music, and folks like Bach dominated (called 'counterpoint' music). A very famous example, that is 'simple' so easy to follow is Bach's Invention #1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzU7xQmmXGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzU7xQmmXGE)

His 'inventions' were for two melodies. He also wrote 'sinfonias' which were for three voices, and are a bit more complex, for example his Sinfonia No.2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZwnXDjbV0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZwnXDjbV0)

Listening to this with headphones while trying to consciously follow all melodies is quite a peculiar experience. :)

In baroque counterpoint the goal is to make every melody interesting in and of themselves, and make it sound 'effortless harmoniously together'. It should sound like these melodies were born together. In practice this aint easy at all and you'll be tempted to see one as the 'primary melody' and the others as 'subservient' where you can take shortcuts to make them fit the main melody. At that point it is no longer true counterpoint but you can still call it a counter-melody. Taken further you'll have things like arpeggios; parts that obviously fit the primary melody but are themselves so bland they are clearly accompaniment instead of a melody in their own right.

I don’t like this first invention of Bach though because it just keeps moving and doesn’t seem to have a tonal center.  It’s not very satisfying even though I’m sure it’s hard to do. I like the sinfonia better because it has more of a sense of rythm.

Question: Does the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> HAVE to be a second voice of the main one or it can be just another melody that fits the song? i.e. Does it have to sound good with the main melody if the two are played together in solo?

Thanks!

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

Yes, a counter-melody is specifically written to be played concurrently with another (primary) melody.

Not quite. A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> by definition contrasts with with the main melody. They can be similar, but it's not simply a duplication of the main melody.  


&gt;Question: Does the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> HAVE to be a second voice of the main one or it can be just another melody that fits the song?

Actually, it wouldn't really be a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at all if it simply mirrors the main melody.

&amp;#x200B;
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-02-24 06:41:26 blackmarketdolphins<br>It's probably the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> he mentioned in the beginning 
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-02-24 07:28:52 bloodyell76<br>I think that a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> can potentially be played independent of the main melody. The assumption is that there's one that more important than the other, but this is not always true. For example, which is the "main" melody in [Conference of the Birds?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYTIXJuxvgY) Is it the saxophone? The flute? The *bass*, perhaps? The saxophone stands out the most, but I don't think the piece works with just that melody. You need all three.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-24 13:26:02 iplanonsleepingin<br>It's usually the mix, or the absence of vocals. Beats are better off being simple rather than being inundated with layers and layers, etc. So it's best to just learn about mixing, compression and other tips rather than just immediately trying to think of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or whatever.  
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-02-25 18:38:46 Jlluminati<br>I love it! I think you do a very good job at leaving space, but keeping it interesting with the beats progression. There honestly isnt too much I would change about it, if anything really. Maybe the mix, but if it's supposed to be ambient and not necessarily for a MC, then its Gold. If you were to have someone rap over it, I would maybe add one more melody/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> in there somewhere, but keep it light. You may run into the danger of crossing genres into an R&amp;B style of beat, but what you have here is great already. Just maybe touch up the low end of the mix to be louder, and soften the highs, add a small extra melody(maybe a pad) and your good. 

That's IF you want to add more to an already dope beat. Be careful with it however; you dont want to add too much more. Nice work overall! 👍

I made a pretty scary-type beat myself, almost the exact opposite end of the spectrum haha. What do you think of it, and what would you change?

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-26 09:00:42 meedzz<br>Damn, love this a lot!

Your melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> together create a super crazy vibe that I believe gives the song a lot of reply value.

Couple of things I personally think would improve my experience of the song include:

 - bringing up the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the mix either by compression or increasing the actual volume-  I think this could increase your EQ- mixing time though to make them both pop. 
- transitions leading into your percussions (at the beginning in particular)- this will help make the song mix and merge together in structure as well as really helping your percussions feel more special. I generally think you have a good sound choice, so you should be fine with what types of transitions to implement. 

Overall I'm digging it!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-26 10:46:38 iammyowndoctor<br>Really cool beat, different in a good way for sure. One idea, the guitar sample and vocals sound great, but I feel like there was a lot of space on the bass side of things that wasn't being filled up hardly at all. Like it sounds almost like you have some strings playing in the bass register, but they sound really muted and in general subdued and simple. I feel like maybe you could bring those out a bit more, have them playing some kind of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the guitar maybe. Just an idea. Be cool to have a little bit of that "orchestral" feel. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-27 11:59:01 lalzolto<br>really dope remix dude, the chopping is on point and the percussion is really groovy esp like the vocoder gives it an awesome vintage feel. i feel like if you could add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or a different switch up to the bass or something during the second drop it would keep the energy up through the whole song. mixing sounds on point, no complaints from me; i personally would prob have put some saturation and more compression on the mix buss. great job bro i like this a lot. the website is mix:analog, ive only used it once but i just used the default mastering chain they have and it turned out nice and cruncy.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-02-28 03:04:56 Mcervenka11<br>Hits hard.

I also think it could also benefit from some additional percs in the drums. 

I definitely agree with your thoughts on mine. Needs a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> of some kind. Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

That is a really good intro 0:00-0:38, builds alot of tension, nice buildup. Im loving the drumwork and hi hats, they're great. The snare sounds great covered in reverb and i love the melody of the hi hats you have going. The panning and drumwork 1:02 is pretty phenomenal, great usage of panning. 808 sounds really nice and clean. Im not a huge fan of the really quick snare rolls but i think thats more my personal preference really, it still sounds good. The usage of silence is a really neat idea, it makes a good bridge. Kicks 2:28 are very clean. Nice little <b><u>counter melody</u></b> @2:57. 

&amp;#x200B;

You got some talent dude, I have zero complaints or criticisms about your track, great mix. Tbh this inspires me to want to give a try to my own futurebass / witchhouse type track eventually, i love the genre, real good work

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-03-02 22:39:47 Graculus_<br>Solid ideas here, liking your hook, and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and chords that come in chime very well.

Also enjoy how you switched to 4/4 at the end. I would love it if you introduced a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or maybe a vocal sample or something after the first minute to keep it interesting, but great work overall!

lmk what you think of mine, just made it during a jam session today, its a rough draft
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-04 02:31:45 Trapaknese<br>Really fucking dig this shit, I think kicks and bass should be more loud but that could be me man, this shit is fire.  Especially the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, wtf. listening as i type this lol. This is crazy!
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-03-04 07:17:03 omgperf<br><b><u>Counter melody</u></b> is a good one.

I always find adding another melody in the back with another instrument helps quite a bit
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-03-04 10:03:29 SoonToBeMore<br>you know i had the same problem for so long because i used chord progressions instead of sticking to simple melody and maybe a one-note pad or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. also its in your drums and bpm too. some melodies and chords change mood depending on how fast or slow theyre played. 

&amp;#x200B;

but in all honesty try just making a scary or dark sounding arp or use an arp preset, then make 1 other <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or accent melody to go with it using another instrument, if you want you can also layer a pad underneath for ambiance. usually youre gonna want to gross beat or halftime the original arp with a decent preset or make your own. then make sure the drum sounds are hard and gritty or just layer samples yourself to get the result. sample selection is big on this but really the main thing to remember is the hardest beats are usually the simplest so just try not to do too much.
</p></li><li><p><b>electronicmusic</b> 2019-03-04 10:19:29 Marcus660<br>It's pretty good. I don't listen to hardcore much but the mix sat decently. One thing that you could do is when the main chorus part comes in, vary up the melody the second time it repeats. A few easy ways to do this would be adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, or taking the main melody and dropping it an octave.

Just my thoughts tho.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-04 13:35:16 PlasmaHeat<br>Thanks for the feedback man, I appreciate it. I'll have to try out using a different instrument the next time I try to incorporate a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and see how that helps out. And that sample was actually taken from Kanye's Sunday Service clip that came out just recently, you should peep it if you haven't already! It was super dope.

Dropped my feedback to your track on your main post.


</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-03-04 22:10:33 TheDamnChicken<br>I mean, that already leaves very little to talk about? Do those first, and it'll be much easier to figure out the feedback for when you're already planning massive changes. 

For the intro, I think the present idea with a simple lead is a good one. The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on the off-beats gets annoying really fast though. Consider muting them at places throughout the song to make a more varied experience.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-03-05 01:05:45 business_hammocks<br>I really like this the chord progression and melody is really nice.  I would say either try adding a B section or stick with what you've got and try and add a bit more harmonic variation to stop it sounding too repetitive, maybe with a counter-melody or something that can work over the top of the main melody so you can introduce one and then have them both going at the same time. Also maybe you could try and build towards more of a climax near the end. But like you say it doesn't necessarily have to go anywhere and it sounds nice as it is!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-06 03:14:08 da7idb<br>Isn’t this like the exact opposite of <b><u>COUNTER melody</u></b>?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-06 04:57:45 purpleovskoff<br>Definitely not a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. That's just playing harmonies. A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is a melody distinct from the original. Counter to it, if you will
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-06 06:16:13 da7idb<br>Hmmm I thought that was just simple harmony. If you have a melodic line A and you have melodic line B and B is just A but up thirds or whatever, that's simple harmony, whereas <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would be a totally independent melodic line, not one that's just "play it again up a third".

Or at least I thought, maybe I'm wrong.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-06 07:49:39 AugustusMusic<br>Thanks, for the feedback.

I really like that interesting bass you used in this. Gives it kind of a unique sound. It sounds pretty well mixed/balanced to me overall. Maybe could change the melody up a bit more with an addition of another little lead line or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> though. Feels a bit static as far as that goes.

I like the drum loop, very mesmerizing.  The bass is pretty low for a hip hop song. I would turn that up a bit.

</p></li><li><p><b>jazzguitar</b> 2019-03-11 20:46:40 WikiTextBot<br>**Counter-melody**

In music, a counter-melody (often countermelody) is a sequence of notes, perceived as a melody, written to be played simultaneously with a more prominent lead melody; a secondary melody played in counterpoint with the primary melody. A counter-melody performs a subordinate role, and is typically heard in a texture consisting of a melody plus accompaniment.

In marches, the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is often given to the trombones  or horns (American composer David Wallis Reeves is credited with this innovation in 1876.)  The more formal term countersubject applies to a secondary or subordinate melodic idea in a fugue. A countermelody differs from a barbershop quartet-style harmony part sung by a backup singer in that whereas the harmony part typically lacks its own independent musical line, a countermelody is a distinct melodic line.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-12 02:17:10 person9<br>So let's talk Hard-bop for a minute.  In that style you often have very specific changes written out with a long list of altered extensions used.   It's complicated because of it's specificity, and you have to be able to jump from one very specific chord/scale, to another very particular chord/scale.  This take a lot of skill, but it can make things a bit rigid.

Modal charts, like "So What" is a bit different.  If you look at a chart it'll say Dm for 16 bars.  However, that's not all there is to it. Basically all that Dm chord tells you is that those are the notes that as a group you have chosen to, "sound right".  They'll sound like home.  There is just no preconceived path to and from there.  

So when comping in a modal style you don't HAVE to just sit on a D chord.  You can, and should at times, and play with rhythmic ideas, but you're also free to imply other movement.  The problem is that you don't want to get TOO functional with it.  Meaning that if you play a ii V I, in normal positions you're going to get something that sounds more...traditionally structured.

Instead focus more on voicings that are vague; such as built on 4ths, and more on scale motion than progressions.  Pick something like 11, 7, 13.  Make that home. Now practice chord scales using that voicing, like you would with a Joe Pass chart.  So 11, 7, 9 becomes 5, 1, 3, then 13, 9, 11, then 7, 3, 5, then 1, 11, 13, and so on.  You can also play little two note versions, which are GREAT...and if you think about those are mostly 4ths...so then you COULD invert those and just play 5ths...power chords!  So if you want it to sound more intense during a section you can SERIOUSLY just throw on an overdrive(or a fuzz, no judgement here), and go to town.  Now of course, you don't HAVE to stay inside either.  You can use chromatic passing tones/chords as well.  Just use the same voicing, and shift it a half step up.  Hit it, maybe hold it for a bit, and go down to something that works.  Or go from an "in" voicing, an "out" voicing to an "in" voicing.  Walk down chromatically for all I care.

Now that you have your sound palette what do you do with it? That depends on you and the soloist.  Give them SPACE.  Maybe you want to keep it simple for a while and just make some rhythmic jabs with one voicing, or a few of them.  Maybe you want to walk up and down the scale.  Maybe you want to sustain one, and every bar(with an anticipation maybe) drop down a chromatic step.  Maybe you want to play a little <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  Maybe the soloist makes a short statement, and you want to try a mimic it in the space they're leaving.  Maybe you sit on a fat UGLY chromatic chord for a bit before resolving a half step up or down.  It's up to you, because there is no written path.  You can get as out as you want.  Just don't forget to real it back in to something relate-able, and TALK with your band members after playing and see what they like and down.

Lastly, remember it's a group effort, and you're supporting a soloist.  If they're pushing to go outside, then follow them.  If they don't, maybe stick to 4ths and playing in.  You can push a little bit, but if they're staying inside and relatively tonal then you probably don't want to sit on a stanky chord.  Maybe just use one in passing and very short.  This part is harder to describe, but it's all about using your ears, and communicating with the soloist while playing.  

So...this is all pretty difficult to do alone.  You really NEED  to practice with people to get the communication element going.  To work up to that I'd recommend playing over a D drone, and either a drum machine or a drum recording to get the voicings down, and get comfortable with what's out and in, and then....find people to play with as fast as possible.  

....fuck that got long.

The melody is great, it is driven by the drums. They blend really well. I was surprised when the other/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> came in but it also fit together really well. This is really chilled and positive, you got a strong vibe going on. Keep it up man. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-12 06:25:30 lalzolto<br>Love this man, you should definitely turn up that bass a bit and maybe add a new <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or rechop the sample to add some variation. Great work man!

LMK what you think of this, first attempt at recording sax. Mix isn't great so thoughts on that would be dope but any feedback is welcome.

1. @0:44 the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> doesn’t seems to really fit the dominant line 
2. The build up to the drop is pretty cool 
3. The speed of the drop relative to the slowed down opening melody sounds a little off but on its own I like the style 
4 the break at 1:30 is cool but comes kinda suddenly I would try adding a little drum fill to introduce it 

Other than that the only thing I might suggest would be somehow incorporating the vocal on the original to hook the song a bit more. I like your style though keep it up!

I liked the lines about Rory and Ben. Specificity is key to writing good lyrics. The image of them on a page is unique and cool. The harmonies towards the end were kinda enjoyable, though mixed poorly I thought. The guitar instrumentals were enjoyable, but I would use a different effect personally. The last "i'll be there" part at the end was quite enjoyable. I dug the harmonies and energy. W

&amp;#x200B;

Areas of potential improvement:

I think the melody is boring. You stay within the range of very few notes and its very repetitive. Maybe try using 4 bar melodies instead of 2. There didn't seem to be any movement in the song or energy to propel the listener forward. A lot of that comes from the lack of melodic and harmonic differentiation from the chorus to the verses. I thought the water sounds in the beginning were weird and unnecessary. Your vocal harmonies were also a lil boring for the most part - they could have used less parallel and similar motion - which is what they were almost entirely. Some contrasting and oblique motion would have added good feels. I thought the mixing of the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> around 2:45 was too loud. Felt distracting rather than adding. The lyrics don't blow me away, but they seem honest which is good. The story in the song doesn't seem to have a lot of continuity. You say "I'd love to make you my wife" in the second verse, but you  have already indicated in the first that you better tell your "rents" which would mean that you have asked her.  Not sure why you're "scared" in the choruses. There doesn't seem to be a reason for the fear that is apparent in the verses. When you say "get through this" what do you mean? Marriage? A sickness? It seems foreboding whatever it is, but as a listener I'm confused because the verses seem like a fun love song and then the chorus indicates something to be scared about.

Theoretically, that would make no sense, seeing as you don't strike crashes with the tip of the stick, but rather the shoulder. Plus, more power from crashes comes with force and certain cymbal types.

They definitely layered the guitars. There's footage of it. Think James was still using his Boogie 2C+ or the Tri-Axis then. Monsterous guitar tone on that record. They did all kinds of crazy shit with the guitars. Not only the layering, but all the overdubs too with different guitars. James used multiple guitars on Nothing Else Matters alone. Telecaster, Gretsch White Falcon (?), a 12 string and who knows what else. Whether it was mirroring the riff with a different guitar and blending it in, or playing different themes on top of it and tucking them in the background. There's a portion in Year and Half in the Life Of where he's tracking a counter-melody on a Telecaster during the chorus/key change. I never caught that bit before I saw that part. Now when I listen to it, I can hear it. It's subtle, but it's there. They did all kinds of cool shit like that.

I really dig this asian vs lofi vibe. Some possibly constructive critiques:

- First off I think this sounds really good as it is so definitely feel proud aboht that. Its a groovy jam.
- The first thing I noticed is that your melody is a bit mellow and doesn't pop out of the mix. This could be a stylistic choice so if that's what you're going for, it works. If you want it to have more authority in the mix, maybe add some slight compression. I'd also consider complimenting the main melody with something like bells or some chime-y synth to add to the high end. Lofi in general tends to be softer on the high end so this definitely removes from that feel but I think helps the meoldy stand out. If you don't mind adding a bit of pop flavor, you could add a light and simple <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on top as well after a bar or two. 
- Your drum mix could use some work. I'm no pro here but I usually run my drums bus through a compressor to glue it together and also make it sound more energetic. Your snare definitely needs to be louder. You could have some hihat rolls really softly as well I think that would work in-between your main hat pattern. 
- Also panning your drums would really help, right now it sounds like everything is center. Including instruments. Panning gives your mix space.
- Finally someone already mentioned your mix is a bit soft. I actually think that's fine, it's best to mix soft. Feel free to throw some gain or limiter that doesn't compress but just raises the gain on your master once you're totally done to bring up the LUFs for loudness.

Hope that helps. I'm not a pro but I think this might help! At the end of the day your track sounds great so keep doing what you're doing!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-17 00:46:59 65TwinReverbRI<br>Depends.

When we say "the melody", we either mean the highest sounding part, or the most important part that is presented as or we hear as the melody.

However, it is possible to combine multiple melodies simultaneously, or have a melody and a "<b><u>counter melody</u></b>", and even accompanying parts can be considered to be highly melodic if not melodies themselves.

If you're talking about 4 Part Harmony in terms of a Bach style Chorale, "the melody" was actually a pre-existing melody that would be familiar to people, and would be harmonized with the other parts. The Soprano part always got this.

So the Soprano has the melody (the Hymn tune) and the other 3 parts accompany it.

But, in 4 Part Choral Works, the melody could be sung in the Tenors while the other parts sing around it.

In Barbershop Quartets, which are in 4 Part harmony, the "Lead" gets the melody, and another part (called the Tenor) actually sings above it. So this is like the Alto having the melody.

The Bass could have the Melody.

You very well could also have a 4 part harmony that serves as an accompaniment itself, to which an additional melodic part is added.

Your word "derived" is a little tricky - I wouldn't say the melody is "derived" from anything.

I know this sounds like a cop out, or defining a word with that word, but the melody is what is the melody! It's hard to explain but you have to know what a melody is by listening to tons of music and identifying it. It's actually hard to define because if you say something like, "it's the thing you can follow" or "it's the thing that stands out" there are other musical elements that meet that definition - one can for example usually easily follow the Bass part in a 4 Part Chorale, but it's not the melody (but that is one of the reasons it can be considered "a" melody or very melodic even though it's not "the" melody).

Why do you ask, or what are you trying to accomplish?
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-17 02:18:09 The_New_Rep<br>Is your name Bartok after the composer haha? 

The beat doesn't suck, it just needs some more elements and a better mix to fill it out. 

Reference your beat to a professional track and compare the levels of each elements (one by one go through the kick, 808, snare/clap, hats, melodies etc.) and the see how the volumes and brightness compare. Your closed hats are a little bit quiet for example and the 808 is a touch over powering.

Your vary your melody sound a little with half-speed and this is good, just try and do a bit more of this. Try layering up the sound with something else, or adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something to make the whole thing feel more expensive.

The elements are all there, just needs polishing up and bit of extra spice!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-17 14:16:35 awairl<br>Try looking outside of “hip hop-sounding” melodies and take inspiration from other genres. also think about counter-melodies. On a thread on here a while ago someone mentioned that the melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> should be like a conversation, have the cm fill in the melody’s empty spaces and make sure they’re not working against each other or drowning each other out. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-18 00:28:45 ImTheWizzy<br>Yo! First thing I noticed is that it's definitely on the quiet side however that should be a pretty easy thing to fix. After that: the intro sounds cool, nothing to critique there. I personally like the melody however I think it could use one more <b><u>counter melody</u></b> maybe for the second part of the hook, just something lowkey to add some more sauce. For me, it sounds like the 808 is a bit too loud in the mix and it almost overpowers some of the other elements. Snare pattern is a bit too busy for my liking but I like to keep it simple so it's maybe more of a personal preference thing. Hats are pretty chill, I like them, nothing crazy. Overall pretty good, I would say mixing and mastering are some things that could def be improved though.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-18 13:55:22 michaelstone4<br>Thanks for the feedback man. Glad you liked it. 
Listening to yours now. The drums and 808 hit hard. It's very open and leaves heaps of room for the vocals which is great for a beat like this. I'm not a big fan f the main synth sound. Hard to say why, it just doesn't make me feel anything. I like the little bits of ear candy you have in the back ground. That ambient bell <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is hard. I think the 808 slides are a little over done and really seem to jump out of the mix. The drum sounds are really good. Hope this feedback helps man.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-18 19:35:44 King_Kunto<br>Yo whatsup; sorry for the late response!

Thanks for reviewing my track earlier! Took note of your advice and made hella changes. I like the melody you have going on in the background. The levelling suggests that you could perhaps add another counter-melody on top to make it sound more alive and full, perhaps a flute if you're heading for that melodic trap/21savage vibe. Really loved the end change in the beat, sort of similar to that of Sicko Mode. Nice work man!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-19 00:05:06 dos_one<br>Thanks man! 

I liked your track!  I always dig strings in a beat.  Your delivery rhythm reminded me a lot of the rapping style from Hamilton, believe it or not, though the actual quality of your voice got real dark/gritty in parts and was definitely more along the Psychopathic Records vein.  Cool stuff.   The mix sounded good to me - vocals sat nicely and nothing jumped out as too loud.

As far as criticism - I didn't love the hihat sound, it sort of bugged me after awhile.  Also, at 1:14 a new <b><u>counter melody</u></b>/mallet/bell type sound comes in that felt a little out of place.  Otherwise super solid man!

***For my rankings:*** 

- I'm a huge fan of songs with lots of harmonization, as you can tell from my ranks (**KB**, **Fire Alarm**, **GS**) -- I also love songs with really great high notes or runs (I could listen to Taeyeon's counter-melody run in **E999** on repeat and never get tired of it).
- I *love* **One Last Time**, everything about it: Taeyeon's emotional high note, Seohyun's repeating "one last time" lines, the girls' group vocals, the message...everything. I listen to it every single time it comes on shuffle...and then I usually replay it a couple more times after that.
- I used to always skip **Genie**, but now I think it's one of their best songs. 
- **Mr. Mr.** is the song that has never failed to make even the most stalwart "I don't care about kpop" friends turn into "I listened to that song in my car on repeat today" friends. 
- **You-aholic** was a song I was relatively late to, but ended up loving because I watched the [Sooyoung fancam](https://youtu.be/OnE526Xd4fw?t=37) *way* too many times. 
- Also, **Galaxy Supernova** is a quality song as it is, but it shoots up my list because I rewatch the [live Endo version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzxtsDsAfi8) a couple times a year and lose my absolute shit laughing every time.

***Honorable mentions:*** **Lil' Touch** (too recent to beat others for me); **Fermata** (great message); **Gee** (such a classic); **Secret** (unexpectedly amazing); **Europa** (it's a song about a moon...*with* 200% more Sunny); **Wake Up** (an underrated b-side; **TTS's Stay** (a favourite, but I stuck to full group songs); **Trick** and **Oscar** (fan favourites, but not the songs I go to first).

Also, while I recognize that **LH Talk Talk** is *probably* the superior song...^(I just *prefer* **IGAB Talk Talk** :X) ^^(sorry)

I like the layout, but I feel like the hi hat choice was a poor sound selection. Other than that I’d work on the mix a little more. I’d just like the kick and 808 to hit a little harder, as well as the snare. Cool track though! Keep working guy. This is solid 

Thanks for listening! Always appreciate the feedback. I have it compressed for sure, but I could definitely try a bit more! 
</p></li><li><p><b>appers</b> 2019-03-20 10:08:43 Arjale<br><b><u>Counter melody</u></b> is off key.
</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-03-20 16:41:38 bentr0k<br>I'm not sure if you're working with chords in your song, but if so, you can always safely use the notes from the chords. Just try them out an octave higher with different timings and lengths. And if you know the key your song is in, you have access to more variation. Sometimes just a few notes is enough for a nice <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Look at it as filling out the space the main melody is leaving. You don't have to fill all the space, but feel free to give the song a bit more body.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the end what often works the best is to listen to your track and try to hum a melody using your voice. This usually results in the most natural (and simpler) sounding melodies. Then try to find each note you're humming and lay it on your piano roll. It's also a great exercise to train your ear a bit more :)
</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-03-20 17:12:04 cubone64<br>When i make counter melodies i just make another melody without trying to make it like an explicit counter to the current melody, while also keeping it in the same key/musical idea. Then i just play them at the same time or wherever i want them to play and see how they sound.

</p></li><li><p><b>avengedsevenfold</b> 2019-03-22 03:12:08 Bach_in_black<br>This album for sure is my absolute favorite one. So much depth to it. I love the weird experimentations they do. Shows their range/talent and that they are more than just a run-of-the-mill metal/hard rock band. It has almost every style of music melded together. Almost all of my personal favorites are ones I’ve seen the most division on: 

- Scream: that pre-chorus riff with the almost sloppy octave slide and the drums...holy shit, the drums are delicious!

- Dear God: this song shows the most depth from them. Such a good jam, especially the end. Great for long trips down desolate roads. The groove during the bridge and outro is so simple it’s perfect pocket playing coupled with the call-and -response between Syn and the pedal steel gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. 

- Gunslinger: The chorus is pure sex! The background vocals and Syn’s counter-melody perfectly compliment the melody Matt is singing and what they other guys are playing. 

- ALPOH: I know nearly everyone loves this song and for good reason. It’s unabashed Broadway-style metal is truly beautiful. Not only do we get a full orchestra but it was written and arranged by Bartek and Mann who arrange for Elfman’s movie scores AND it tells a fun dark love story while being commercial sounding enough to appeal to a lot of people (I know it’s far from commercial).  I know Fiction is what people, including The guys in the band, deem and Jimmy’s crowning achievement but I’d say ALPOH is truly his Magnum Opus. And from watching the behind the scenes footage from the making of.. it all started with just his ideas laid out on Drums, 2 piano tracks (1 per hand) and a vocal track. Such an amazing mind

Not to mention all the other songs on the album are so fun to listen to, break down (I’m a musician so I always try to find isolated tracks online), and watch how they came about. This album showed me how to blend styles while still retaining identity. I’ve been waiting for another album as experimental since it was made and The Stage came extremely close that it almost feels like it’s spiritual successor. 

Thank you for your time. Sorry to pontificate.

If I'm working on a string quartet, I do it on my bed or go to a cafe. Sometimes I'll change my environment completely; book a weekend somewhere new. 

If I'm in a bad mood, I can't really be productive because of my mind being consumed somewhere else. I've learned to take off a lot of the pressure. Sometimes, I'm just not in the mood to write, ya know? After work, on a Wednesday, fuck...I'm tired. Friday night...I'm tired. If I'm not in the mood to create, I make sure to do something else. Practice the piano, perhaps.

I started to look into creating a calendar with a realistic expectation of what I'd like to do on a weekly basis. For instance, Monday I'll work on a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Tuesday I'll rework the arp sequence. Wednesday, I'll clean up my session. Thursday I'll listen back and write down my initial thoughts. Friday - Saturday I'll make those changes.

Lastly, losing the ego is a big part of it. Musicians that I see killing it live or writing at an efficient and effective rate and just not giving a shit about it. Not that they don't care, but they realize how much it really doesn't matter. Here's the song. Is it dope or not? Here's the performance? Fuck, that was fun. Who cares about the bad notes. It takes awhile to get there and I'm still working on it. All of my best work, live and writing, has been in the moment when I'm just enjoying it without judging myself.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-26 02:28:49 Mcervenka11<br>I like the vibe a lot. Have you tried the piano chords at an octave lower? Might sound cool. Just a hunch. Overall I like the chords/melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and the variation you used with those. I think it might benefit from some variation in the drums a bit. Much some subtle additions and subtractions with some of the the percussion elements. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-26 07:53:35 user1444<br>The intro could be a little more interesting IMO, it didin't really catch me right away.  
I like the plucked melody but I'd like it more with some more variation.  The beat feels kinda empty overall, could use a sparse <b><u>counter melody</u></b> of some high synth or just plucks of the same note.  
Not bad man, keep it up!

Adding some brass stabs with the main levels melody / whatever avicii melody is your favourite as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> during the bridge and ending with the euphoric levels drop would be powerful. Ending the mix with the “good feelings” Tim would have wanted us to remember him by.

</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-03-30 04:10:14 LosingWithStyle<br>It’s a per song basis.  Does the riff need the extra thickness of you doubling it?  Does the song need a background <b><u>counter melody</u></b>?  The short answer is play to the song, not the guitarist.  My suggestion would be to record it with how you play it now.  Then play along with the recording and see if you can find something that accompanies the riff better.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-30 18:04:32 GregoryBennettMusic<br>&gt;  guys, here’s a new beat I finished today. Let me know what you think!
&gt; 
&gt; I’ll return all feedba

I like the percs and sounds that create those big transitions! <b><u>Counter melody</u></b> is on point too!

 I would consider adding something like a synth pad or some more reverb on the lead to help keep the upper frequencies engaging between chords. Its feels a little choppy in sections where there is nothing behind the lead, if that makes sense?

Cool 
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-03-30 22:08:53 nobody2000<br>I write horns for ska, so it's fun - I can write a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, a hook, or just copy the melody. If I'm in a true slump, I copy something that someone else wrote in the song. My guitarist wrote a solo which I thought was out of place for the whole song (it fit the chords, but the song....not really). So - I just copied that and spun a variation off the end of each phrase. 

When I was writing guitar and lyrics for another band, I typically just wrote the melody first and built the chords around that. 

To get inspired, I basically did two things:

- Listened to my favorite songs in the genre
- Listened to some 70s/80s pop rock heavy-singer bands like REO Speedwagon, Journey, and even some hair metal. 

It basically reminded me "keep this shit simple, but fun." Worked like a charm everytime. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-30 22:46:23 dudeon41<br>Thanks man!

I live the groove on yours, I was boppin along to it. I definitely think it could use a lead or some other kind of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to come in at some point to keep things interesting, but aside from that I liked it a lot!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-30 23:09:33 dudeon41<br>Thanks! And ya the triangle is definitely cheesy as hell haha!

Yours is nice! I think it could use some sort of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or an arp or something else to spice it up a bit and keep it moving because right now you're just kind of waiting for the next piano/pad stab to come in and there's nothing else really going on melody wise to keep it interesting. Maybe add a little reverb/delay to the snare or just turn it down a little to get to sit better in the mix too. It kinda stands out now being so dry when everything else is dreamy/reverbed out.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-03-31 10:46:07 motivation150<br>Don't just use the loop, slap on some drums, add your tag, and call it a day.

Play with the pitch, the speed, add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, change it up a bit. Might help with the guilt.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-31 13:49:20 VoM123<br>The mix is pretty full which is good for a beat like this with the ambient sample. Only things I would add is layer another kick on the one you have to make it punch through the mix a bit more and another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or 2 to change it up a bit cause I did feel that it got a bit repetitive towards the end. Otherwise its a nice chill beat.  
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-03-31 22:53:27 Strooble<br>I've eq'd them a little and it puts them a bit more in the background but they aren't clippy now I think. I couldn't find a snare pattern that would work, I felt it didn't add anything good to the mix and negatively impacted it, but I am aware snares aren't a strong point for me. Thanks for the critical feedback, it's exactly the kind of thing I am after. 

I'd eq out some of the low end to avoid the distortion, it really ruins it for me. I was also expecting some hats or something else to come in. I really like the start though, it would make a dope melody like it is now if you can incorporate some more drums or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. You could end up having a dope use of this sample if you keep at it man. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-02 10:24:54 xREVENGEx<br>You got the right ideas but it’s just a lil too basic. Don’t get me wrong simplicity is key but there is a fine line between basic fire/ repetitiveness. I’d say you need a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for some switch ups and the mix could do with some work. Kick is too low and the bass way too loud and thick. All the components are in place for a hard beat but just a few tweaks needed. Keep grinding bro 
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-04-03 04:07:13 Alpha-Bromega<br>The song sounds well produced. The piano that you use sounds thin imo. The mix feels quite empty when it’s just the piano chords playing with the main melody.  I would try to add a second <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to add during the later choruses since all of these blend. Just to add a bit of spice and variety. Nice song
</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-04-03 06:08:22 ThiccJuulRip<br>I like it but you need to work on the mix. The 808 is very loud and drowns out some of the other sounds, and the piano seems a bit loud as well. Try changing up the bass line, instead of following the tonic of each chord you could switch some up to a fifth or octave, I think that would make the beat a bit more dynamic. I would also add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, something that doesn't take up too much mid frequency because you already have the piano there, and it will create a muddy mix if you have too many sounds playing at that frequency. On the master, I'd add and EQ to get rid of any frequency under about 120hz just to clean up some of the rumble. And my last suggestion would be to take some low end out of the piano playing a lower octave because you don't want it to clash with the 808.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-03 20:45:47 nvduhn<br>This is a well composed track. Sound selection is on point. Good vibe, good melody. Maybe try adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>? It gets a bit repetitive and is slightly long.

I would try adding more saturation to the drums. The clap and hats feel a little dry. I would also try panning things a bit more to give them a bit more space. The mix is okay rn, another 30 minutes spent on it and you'll be golden.

Good stuff though.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-03 23:47:07 nvduhn<br>Sometimes I just start the second verse with my <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to achieve a bear switch. It's a simple one but I feel it can definitely work if done right.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-04 01:36:21 FreeezingCanadian<br>Oooooh this is dope! I really like how many layers of percussion are here and how they compliment each other. Really like the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in half way through the track too. Maybe raise the bass and kick up so they are more prominent in the beat. Maybe to keep it varied you could cut the melody out for a 1/4 note and just let some random part of the percussion have the spotlight. Other than that this is pretty cool man

</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriting</b> 2019-04-04 07:14:17 IndieScum<br>I’m not totally sure what you’re going for in terms of genre or anything but I can give you some generic feedback. To start I think that thing stood out to me the most was monotony of it. I’d suggest maybe adding another layer, like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or minimalist percussion   (because I get the sense that you want to create more minimalist stuff). If not, then I would at least record your songs with a metronome through earbuds or something so you can stay in time, that’s important songs like yours. Because your songs aren’t layered and are just one track, any small mistakes, like playing out of time or having strings a little out of tune, will stand out. I think you e got a really interesting foundation though in terms of mood though, I think you could make some cool pieces if you experiment a little and practice. 
</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-04-05 23:38:15 KenKenBeats<br>Nice beat, add more percs or maybe <b><u>counter melody</u></b>
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-04-06 04:29:14 Jar_Jar_R_Martin<br>Counter-melody
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-04-06 07:28:44 jayocaine<br>Totally.   


1. Beginning is sounding really chill, good atmosphere, try taming that one resonant frequency through out the song with just a small dip tight Q factor. A slight bit jarring.   

2. Sounds nice a full, but not huge when the bass comes in, which I'm assuming thats what you're looking for you accomplished that really well. 
3. The kick stands out really nicely, the transients are pretty clear.  

4. Solid dynamics over all, try adding more <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in more sections, preferably to make a drop bigger.  

5. I love glitchiness, but in this case needs some touch ups a bit out of time in some areas.   


Overall it's sounding pretty damn good, just main thing is that one frequency in the background, is too loud and needs some taming with an EQ. 
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-04-07 03:25:09 Emissarybeats<br>Nice beat. 

In terms of the melody, it feels like there’s too long a gap between each of the chords ( unless that’s the vibe you were going for) I would definitely add another instrument or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at a faster pace to fill in those gaps. 

But again this is all subjective. I think it sounds cool the way it is, but that’s just something I think could help. 


I hope this helps 
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-04-07 05:50:41 jayocaine<br>wana post some stuff and I can maybe give you some tips? Essentially mixing is:  
1. Choosing the correct timbre or instruments (you know filters on synths, wav shapes etc.)  
2. The melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>  
3. harmonies etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-08 01:43:58 nodakian<br>This beat is nice.  Drums hit hard and the simple melody fits that tay-k vibe.  I think your producer tag is a bit loud.  The beat is also little sparse at times IMO.  If you made this with the intent to get a rapper then that would be the perfect fix IMO.  Otherwise you've got room for another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or pad. But this is a banger on its own as is!

[Here's](https://soundcloud.com/odakian/through-the-fog/s-EZ8Zp) mine when you want to check it. 


</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-08 09:47:14 Mallow_GD<br>This is beautiful g. Its fr got 6lack written all over it. I especially like the emotion the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> brings up during the chorus. Really broadens the beat and gives it more dynamics and layers. Even without an artist on it, this shits a vibe man. 
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-08 11:00:55 xREVENGEx<br>Hell yeah you did. Melodies and drums on point. Mix nice and clean too. Would have added another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> though, nothing too much just something to give it slightly more variation. Solid work though bro.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-04-09 04:40:23 Alpha-Bromega<br>Whats up. I think the snare could definitely be louder. It gets drowned in the mix. For instruments that also play with the snare and have the same frequency, you can also sidechain that instrument to the snare (softer than kick). 

Adding risers for the buildup and white noise FX once the drop hits will help with the impact. You can also automate the volume of the buildup for this a bit (make it a couple of dbs lower than the actual drop) to make it hit better. 

I would find a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to add some variety. or add some variety to the synths playing. 

good job
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2019-04-09 10:15:23 boelter_m<br>Three things, you could have just left the bass out and made it a quartet. It adds a tiny bit, but the little bits of pizz don't justify the extra player in my opinion. I'm sure you could mix it in more with some arco though.

From my quick listen, it seems like the majority of the harmony is either thirds or block chords. There were a couple sections where you introduced a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something, but from my memory, it was rather rare. There was also a lot of unison. This somewhat fine, but it makes the texture rather uninteresting.

Lastly, it just feels very monotonous. Maybe it just needs some real players to make it work, but there just wasn't anything to keep me engaged after the first minute or so. The thirteen minute runtime seems extremely inflated to me.

I know most of this has been negative, but you did did put some serious work into this, and I really respect that. I hope what I mentioned will help you in the future. If you ever get this performed, be sure to record it so we can hear it. I suspect live musicians could bring a lot more out than musescore can.

</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-04-10 08:26:50 AnalAssailant<br>I usually do the same thing. Adding some effects like eq, delay, reverb, phaser, stereo shaper etc. is a great way to work with a sample you like but don’t want to change much. I’ll typically do that with a loop rather than change up the whole sound. 

P.s. Making a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or two to your loop and then getting rid of the loop is a great way to come up with something too.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-10 14:55:35 VoM123<br>This beat is so sick! The melody and drums have a great grove to it and everything sounds like its mixed well.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-10 23:15:16 manocchs<br>Good stuff man.

Nice! So i'm writing this as im listening so bare with me. 

The melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> are nice. Reminds me of space cadet and that whole space trippy vibe.   


Along with that, I get some real Metro Boomin' type vibes from this, especially since your drums are boomin!! But my suggestion is to work on variation.   


The beat sounds nice but it is repetitive, and with a little work in adding some variation, this beat will be GOD LEVEL 

&amp;#x200B;

Just my two  cents
</p></li><li><p><b>teenagers</b> 2019-04-12 11:31:55 half-of-an-italy<br>Its ok, like 6/10, ya need some variation, also another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> maybe could spice it up, but thats just my thing

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-04-12 11:46:32 OrganicChemistrysux<br>Using the same sound in different sections keeps the song glued. Layering it differently isn't a bad idea but it probably won't help keep the song glued unless you have the same sound in both sections. I like to layer specific notes which allows the former and creates a new sound. 

I often use the same sounds in different sections but have them play different roles (e.g. <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, fill, lead, chord, pad, etc)

Automating the mix helps the same sounds fill different roles (volume,reverb,delay, stereo width, panning, etc). Subtle creative effects also work. 

The song can still be glued between sections with completely different sounds but its harder. It would require some sort of motif being kept (e.g. lead motif kept in bass line, same chord progression, same rhythm, same lyrics, etc)
</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriters</b> 2019-04-12 21:33:24 supercactus666<br>Idk what everyone is saying here tbh if you've got a riff go for a chord progression then an optional <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to spice shit up
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-04-13 04:09:15 patrickvier<br>So first thing I think is the track is too long at over 6:30. Try to cut down to sub 5 minutes, cause to me it seemed really repetitive. The best way imo is to make verse 1 with your main melody, carry that through chorus 1. Then during the breakdown introduce a variation or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> which can interplay with the melody in chorus 2.

&amp;#x200B;

So in terms of your mix, I think the biggest issue is during your chorus, there is a lack of drive due to too much going on. It sounds like you layered a bunch of saws, but since theres so many they actually don't have any perceived loudness due to phasing issues. So your waveform looks full, but it lacks any clear voicing of whats going on. Additionally, with all this going on your percussion needs a boost, don't be afraid to crank the volume on the kick snare/claps to make them more audible. They are your backbone and driving force for the track.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-04-13 05:15:36 ChardIsSoHard<br>You're cheating yourself dude. It's obvious this is your first creative pursuit. Your disregard (and disdain) for people with experience is a little weird, I don't really understand the purpose of talking shit to people who are simply offering you good advice. 

I'm a sample junkie just like you. The difference is I'm willing to admit that I'm a sample junkie because I *can't* write my own melodies - which I would love to be able to do. I'm teaching myself while I simultaneously beat myself up for not listening to my parents and following through with those piano lessons a decade or two ago. 

Do you think sample gods like Kanye or 9th wonder or J Dilla don't know how to write a bass line or a <b><u>counter Melody</u></b>? Do you think the small handful of big time producers out there with limited knowledge of music theory act like you in the way they project actual disdain for people more educated than they are? 

Because that's what you're doing. This thread is quite literally you celebrating your ignorance. You feel threatened by "boomers" (which, come on man, you sound like a child) who are telling what you have isn't enough, which is understandable. 

But your young. Start developing good habits now. Get comfortable being honest with yourself and acknowledging your shortcomings - those are your best opportunities to become a better producer. The only reason I'm spending this time writing this is because I had people to help point me in the right direction as I was coming up in other creative endeavors. 

Your attitude towards this whole thing is poison. You admit somewhere in here that you're going to learn theory at some point ... So you see the value in it. But for now, you're going to talk shit to the people that also think it would be valuable to learn music theory? Hmm. Take some time to think about that one and the professional that you aspire to be. Professional want to fuck with other professionals.

&gt;  Well, if my advice and opinions sound strange, it’s because I’m just the counter-melody. 

&gt; I know I’m not the only voice you hear. There’s another message I know you are hearing, because it’s a common message we all hear these days. So let’s call that the melody. 

&gt;  I may love that melody too, but I don’t want to just duplicate it. So I try to think of a good counter-melody. 

&gt; I do it to compensate (or over-compensate) for something I think is missing in the common message.  My public writing is a counterpoint meant to complement the popular point.

If most people agree on a set of beliefs, it’s pretty easy for group blind spots to enter. It’s useful for a small group to examine and question a lot of that, even if a lot of what they generate ends up being useless. We do a lot of that here, and if you enjoy it, great. If not, there are plenty of other subreddits around singing the melody.

Just a heads up, though—if you do want to comment here, this is the sort of comment that could draw warnings and bans pretty quickly. We respond well to counter-arguments, but brief, outright dismissal isn’t really the style people here try to encourage.

Sounds like there is a solo cello for most of the melody and piano for <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Strings give it a bunch of texture and the choir makes the ensemble sound richer/fuller.
</p></li><li><p><b>gamemusic</b> 2019-04-13 14:52:56 Shnowyy<br>Mind if i ask you what software you use for composing, as well as your soundpack? I love how authentic the strings and woodwind sound.

Also i actually like the unison between the strings and the piano/woodwind, it really highlights the melody above everything. I feel like the inclusion of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would be more fitting for whenever the main theme is used as a motif in the game, maybe with an area or character leitmotif as the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>? Just a suggestion.
</p></li><li><p><b>TechnoProduction</b> 2019-04-14 05:13:09 rzm25<br>Honestly, I would like to politely disagree with this. I think the kick is heavy and clear as. For me the problem is the song structure. The reason I don't think I could see myself losing my shit to this is because there isn't really a story beign told with the sounds. as /u/Julio59138 aptly pointed out, the lead starts strong, sounds like a great concept, but then it kind of just.. keeps going. After the break it comes back, but is quieter. I understand the idea, it is taking the back seat to give the low end of the spectrum the focus for the drop, but given nothing new is added, there is a lack of any sense of build up or release. It's just some kind same-y ambience continuing on. I think having a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> build and then it taking the center focus would instead give a much larger sense of that energy release.  


I hear a strong reference to Four Tet's Opus remix here. Note the main difference is the lead actually builds in intensity for the drop, instead of diminishing. Also it was about intentionally playing with song structure to create artificial anticipation, which I am not feeling so much here.  


I hope this wasn't too harsh, I only give such a strong opinion because I think the song has potential, as it is legitimately already quite good in most aspects.

The vocal melodies could using some polishing. And those end notes could be delivered with more blood and soul, if ya feel me. I wanted one more element in the melody to go with he keys other than the atmospheric stuff. Something that brought some <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Grind on!

The beat for me overall seemed good, I think I was just waiting for a bit of a higher pitched <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to kick in. Other than that bro I liked it a lot, keep that up!

Here’s my latest:
https://youtu.be/7IL2SaGcdcw
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-15 17:55:19 Hammond_Chizandovich<br>Your beat is really damn good haha, I'm used to just enjoying and getting inspired by stuff like this rather than critiquing it. All the instruments sounded really clean to me and the sense of space was nice, transitions were on point too without getting too distracting (assuming this is intended to be rapped over). I reckon the little melodies you have looping throughout sound great and you can make it better with some more variation. In particular the instrument that came in at 1:26ish, I expected it to vary a little bit, like at the very least go up on the last note or something rather than repeat the same tune that was good for the first two bars. Same with the main melody by the very end, though maybe that's just because I listened to the song a bunch of times.

Maybe it would have been cool to have a really heavy-handed counter-melody/improvisation cutting through on a violin or something for a section after around the 2 minute mark to really elevate the song. Finally, from a rapper's perspective, I usually prefer not to wait 30 seconds for the percussion to really kick in, though after a few listens I think a little pre-verse rap in those preceding bars would actually work well. Also, your percussion had some nice variety, the vocal touches were great too.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-15 19:57:16 TheToppa<br>Thanks for the feedback homie, glad you enjoyed it! Your beat is definitely a solid project, I like the ambient melodies but I feel like your percussion may be overcompressed, there isn't much dynamics in your kicks/hi-hats. Besides that though, it's really dope. Big up  on the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> as well, really adds some nice variation.
</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-04-15 21:47:51 SamuelCarnie<br>Thank you :) sorry for repeating everything again, i couldnt think of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for the secont part, but maybe next time :)
</p></li><li><p><b>whatstheword</b> 2019-04-16 02:31:21 Wrym<br>Does counter-melody (a subordinate melody accompanying a principal one) apply?
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-16 02:58:51 TheToppa<br>Really creative spin on the beat to sync it with Black Panther. The sound selection is on fucking point, really spacey and trippy for sure. Mix sounds really clean, couple of things I would adjust though. Firstly, your kick sounds too clicky and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> (the strings that are panned) sounds louder on the left side than on the right side. Fix that up and I think this is gonna be on point!

</p></li><li><p><b>Gamingcirclejerk</b> 2019-04-17 01:37:37 Redd500<br>[i've listened to this song on repeat for a while and i picked up on some things](https://soundcloud.com/plrusek-chan/home-world-run-ost-waterworks-theme)

1) It's reminding me of the Jazz Jackrabbit OST for some fucking reason.

2) There's 2 "instruments" or sounds that switch between playing the melody and the counter-melody. Like one instrument will be playing the melody and the other will be in the background playing something else, and then they'll switch places, and then they'll do it again, etc. Also I'm not sure if "counter-melody" is the proper term for what I mean.

3) Love those Konami arcade/16-bit stings.
</p></li><li><p><b>trance</b> 2019-04-17 04:34:18 armadillo020<br>A good <b><u>counter melody</u></b> makes a track. Plus it shows the artist has a basic understanding of a strong musical piece.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-17 07:24:45 ZaqueDidIt<br>How I get by it is if I’ve made a 4 bar loop as my melody I’ll do an 8 bar loop for my <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or vice versa. I’ll always break my hats down into 2 sections A and B them for the hooks and do the same with different patterns for my verses. Everything else usually stays consistent throughout. After that it just comes down to your arrangement. If you’ve taken something out put something else in. Maybe a bell, or a short pluck. Just something to get the listener to keep paying attention.
</p></li><li><p><b>jazztheory</b> 2019-04-17 09:10:22 falapadoo<br>A mentor told me to be more aleatoric with comping, concerning yourself more with the shape of your chords and their motion while leaving the notes themselves up to chance. A couple wrong notes won’t ruin the song if your counter-melody is interesting enough. Maybe null over that a bit and see how you play.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-17 20:12:25 dirtyfacemarcus<br>I think the track has potential.

I think before the drums come in you should add a sub bass or some sort of bass 

An idea I had while listening was maybe adding a piano playing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>

or maybe a whistle-like synth to give a little change up every 4 bars or so

Keep grinding
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-04-18 00:16:24 AssRaptorr<br>Love the cold opening. Very professional when it comes to quality. It's clear you know what you're doing.  The only thing that I could really give you here is all opinion based, but personally, I think there should be a darker feeling <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in around the 35 seconds mark.  Hard to explain but I think this will help set the mood of what you're going for with the bass a little better.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this was of any help! great stuff.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-18 03:04:53 nvduhn<br>This piano is dark.

Love that raunchy 808. Hi hats going all over sets a nice vibe and that perc in the background is a great touch. Snare could be a bit louder maybe but with vocals it's pretty well laid out for a very aggressive flow that will carry the beat and give impact.

Country melody is well composed and I like the effects on it. Mix is solid, sound selection is good.

I feel it could use more saturation, either in the percussion and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or main melody. Some delay could bring out the piano more as well. But I'm nitpicking this is good stuff.
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-04-18 16:25:35 captainvita<br>It's a nice Beat. Has lots of space for Vocals. I would add another Element although. Maybe a <b><u>counter Melody</u></b> or something.

Really smooth beat you made! I fw it but my only feedback would be to add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. The melody is super dope and I like all the different elements to it, but have it breakdown or bring in another synth just to change it up. Great work, keep it up!!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-04-19 10:45:33 BenjaminShoe8<br>I think the answer to your question would largely depend on your definition of a baseline and the genre it's being played in.

According to my definition, a "good" baseline is a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in a low range used to make more important melodies coherent, establish chord structure, or give the listener something consistent to hold on to as the music progresses.

A question and answer format could easily apply to my definition of a "good" baseline.

An example of the concept you are referring to I saw In the comments was Chameleon by Herbie Hancock. I think this is an excellent example of good use of your idea.

I hope this helped. Have a great weekend!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-19 21:41:57 MattPlays17<br>Really good drums and mastering, melody gets repetitive so maybe add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. It's good sound selection though :D

Your track is really cool however its not exactly my style so I will try to provide feedback to the best of my ability. The sample is really well done! I think you should bring in another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and/or switch up the percussion it gets a lil stagnant. Nonetheless great work! Could definitely see someone spitting bars over this!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-20 06:33:13 dickeddocks<br>I really like this beat, theres a very unique sound to this besides being a very good chill beat. I like the pitch slides on the 808 and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> come together to make a very interesting and cool sounding beat. You have a very good sound so definitely keep up the work.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-04-20 14:01:49 eyepatch_29<br>I think it needs some kind of <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, something to break away the repetition of the beat, because after around a minute, it starts getting old real quick.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-21 04:18:22 AssRaptorr<br>Fire! The only thing I would add personally is another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that is more upfront in the mix. The main <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is good, but seems very distant possibly due to the reverb.

&amp;#x200B;

But for all I know, this could be the exact vibe you were going for. Great stuff!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-21 12:45:16 ayefamwelive253<br>Yea I never even mess with sample kits, one because of that but two because I haven’t trained my ear to be able to develop a bass pattern or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the same scale, but I’m mainly talking about midi kits from wav supply, at the bottom of the checkout area it says that any midis used in placement songs must be split with the creator, but I literally change all the midis I use
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-22 03:20:46 GGyung<br>I love all the sound choices on this. The drums sound awesome and the melody fits right in sonically. The melody was nice, but it also didn't really grab me, its got more of a mellow, background kind of feel, maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is needed, or maybe its just missing an artist to hop on it. Great job on the production quality though!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-22 03:40:13 MattFirenzeOfficial<br>Hey man you can hit me up if you want some help or do a collab. I put my beats up / sell beats on youtube and have been doing well recently. I think first you gotta find out what you're good at and what style you are making quality beats with. Once you have an identity then you can focus on just making good beats. One thing that may help is try listening to some of your favorite beats/songs and see how the song introes, when does the verse start, when does the chorus of the beat come in, when does the bass come in, how is the bass line playing, how does the kick drum hit, what high hat flow is there, what is the main melody, is there a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.. etc. Focus on specific parts of the beat as a skeleton and then try to flesh out your own beat.
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-04-22 20:40:02 fwilliams13<br>I'm digging this! This is dope. I really like the melody and the, IDK if it's a Marimba or what, but those are nice. I like the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> as well which may be a slower bell/synth? Idk but It all sounds beautiful together. The drums are nice I would, say for a track like this to add some more excitement to the drums but they actually sound pretty lit.. and I can see that the periods of not lit-ness are just where the vocals are supposed to be.   


I love this track fam, keep up the good work!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-22 21:25:10 CoryReyes<br>You need a good <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, all your other parts should have different patters (hi hats, snares(sometimes), kick, 808) and every 8 bars switch it up, add something or remove something but make sure it still feels right whatever you remove/add. Also Vox and percs go a long way if done right.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-22 23:14:10 JKnotRowling<br>This is super cool bro! I like the sample a lot. If anything, I would just add a few more percussive elements and maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> like a flute or something. Great work!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-23 00:00:56 durian_smoothie<br>this is hard. i agree could use a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> but as is its dope af good use of the samples, good chopping skills, good drum selection

did a demo on a beat i made, possibly turning it into a full song. what do you think? https://soundcloud.com/oshunox/calabasas-reference-track/s-D5dBg
</p></li><li><p><b>Peripheryband</b> 2019-04-23 03:12:08 Pope_Stumpy<br>The arrangement is for vibraphone and tuba, actually! I'm writing the accompaniment/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> for me in the vibes part with the melody in the tuba. My best friend from school (who introduced me to Periphery in 2012) and I have this duo together and we've both been listening to P4 pretty relentlessly since it came out. I thought arranging this for us would be a fun project!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-23 09:06:59 EscapeKG<br>Thank you for the feedback bro. Will take the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> thing into consideration for future beats. 

Definitely think you should turn this into a full song. Melody is catchy, beat is mad smooth. You might want to drop the beat earlier cause it takes 30 seconds and that might be too long but that’s just a personal preference thing. Good job bro.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-23 10:55:27 _mDubz<br>I think you have the vibe right. At some points I wish the melody had one more <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to it to kinda jazz things up but overall it's a pretty nice track. Keep up the good work!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-23 13:15:03 Bartolious_Clout<br>Really vibey track, I fw ur style of production fr. I think the structuring as a whole is very good however it would have been nice to hear an additional synth or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> come in, even just mess around a lil bit more with the sample to switch it up some. I like the way the drums hit although it sounds like you changed the kick halfway through which I don't think was necessary. Imo you hit the nail on the head with the first kick and aside from that everything else fit so well together. Nice hihats, nice choice of sample and i fw the vision you got, keep it up!!

&amp;#x200B;

I like the melody and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and the drums, shit, i like the beat as a whole concept -- it sounds super interesting

But

It needs some variation please my friend. It needs to have something more going on than looping and taking out some things some times   


I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say with vocals this could sound great, but without them, it's just another beat that doesn't stand alone.   


You make two beats a day which is great, and i see you're just trying to up your game and learn more everyday which i cannot fault you for. But, maybe, work on one at a time and make that one sound awesome, you learn a lot that way as well, with trying to make something interesting

&amp;#x200B;

Just my two cents and like I said its not to be rude, just a bit of advice 

&amp;#x200B;

KEEP producing! You are doing great!
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-04-24 01:48:59 JDappa_official<br>The bass and drums definitely carry this beat. The intro gets dry and seems to be too long of just that one lead (imo). Perhaps make it more obvious when the chorus comes in. I know added a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> so I'm assuming where it would be but perhaps adding one more sound or effect to make it stand out. Good job and good luck!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-24 06:38:55 DcmArk<br>For 2 months this is not bad at all. 
The melody gets kind of annoying after a little bit. 
You could add some chords or maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to kind of help pace. 
Also, try panning your drums a bit. Like move your cymbals to the side. Keep at it!
</p></li><li><p><b>brandnew</b> 2019-04-24 09:50:42 Besthookerintown<br>Very cool.  I liked a lot of it.  Good luck to you guys.  He rips on guitar and your vocals are really authentic.  


Remember western music is just one melody at a time.  Lead vocals or instrument lead!  Unless they harmonize or one is a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, when they cross each other and are not in unison it makes everything too chaotic, even for fans of chaotic music, and even when the parts are impressive as a stand alone.  

Again nice work and I’d check out more of your stuff.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-25 01:36:27 cautionyellowtape<br>if we are being honest, all you need is one melody, drums, and a good bassline. but that's a little simple when you post beats so Id suggest you make a main melody and one <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to bring in and out. after that its just drums. you could put in short beat pauses at the end of some bars because that always adds to it when the beat comes back in.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-25 11:07:29 Bartolious_Clout<br> Appreciate the feedback!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I like your track the drums hit really nicely and that 808 is smooth! I think the melody could use a lil more variation or add an additional <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Really nice work though keep at it!!
</p></li><li><p><b>Jazz</b> 2019-04-25 12:29:28 improvthismoment<br>I find hearing and singing the root movement to be super helpful in understanding and memorizing the harmony. Maybe not a real walking quarter note bass line like a good bass player would play. But at least I learn to hear the root movement as a kind of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the main melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-04-26 01:56:11 Psychological_Mind<br>Yeah definitely should have put in a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-26 18:21:12 _mDubz<br>This is pretty good for a first try at a new genre. I like the 808 pattern. I think it could use a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or two tho to help break the receptiveness of it. Keep up the work tho.
</p></li><li><p><b>explainlikeimfive</b> 2019-04-26 19:55:31 a-WaltzingMatilda<br>Well, see in coding, especially object oriented, you have classes and you have objects, and they fit together and work as you connect them together. 

I thought I preferred the graphical object oriented type, like Max/MSP, but since I’ve been doing some C++ I actually think that the graphical approach is really really limiting. You can connect basically anything abstractly with code. 

My biggest issue is actually remembering the names, because I remember what their function is and how they work and then forget the name and have to ask google “what’s the name of that class that does this this and this?”. That happens a lot in real life to be honest, not remembering the name but completely understanding what it does. It makes explaining things cumbersome and I should really work on associating a name with a function. 

In music, you have underlying harmonic structure and you have melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and they fit together. Music is just a sequence of functions, and it moves in real time. Understand the functions and it’s possible to learn it completely by ear, and also to create new music. None of that is even remotely visual. 

Or, say sports, I played squash a lot when I was younger, and I could “6th sense” other players out of the game because my positioning and judging where the ball would go next were so good. In a sense, I *was* using a 6th sense, the sense of proprioception, “size and shape in space”. So, my judgement of where the ball is going to be next is spatially relational to where I am.

I realised with finding out that not everyone has inner monologue (I certainly do), and finding the aphantasia sub that there’s such a wide variety of ways that people think and experience the world. It’s only then that I realised that my entire thinking process is spatial, my learning style is kinaesthetic (learn by doing) and all of my favourite activities are physical and spatial, playing music, playing sports. building circuits, acting. 

See, if I ask you to imagine a shape like a cube, you’re gonna picture it. 

I don’t, but I can hold that shape in my head, I know what a cube is and I know what it can do and how it rotates. I can’t really describe it because the description of a cube already does that, I’m just not actually seeing a picture of it in my head. But it’s there. 

It’s the same with anything in physics or maths. Like I dunno, vectors are spatial units. I can spatialise a vector pretty easily. Current flow has a spatial dimension, charge, flux, field, mass, length, etc. I mean, it’s called physics for a reason.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-27 02:15:31 ZaqueDidIt<br>I learned this super recently. I just work with a melody and a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> every once in a while. Give it some interesting drums and arrange it properly and you’ve got better stuff than most producers out there
</p></li><li><p><b>shareyourmusic</b> 2019-04-27 02:55:15 T33onC<br>So lofi indeed.  The song had a very chill vibe and intro was preaching love, and I'm not against that. The only thing I woud suggest is, more transitions. Maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to keep is fresh? But keep it up.
</p></li><li><p><b>MusicBattlestations</b> 2019-04-27 03:19:10 RyanTheArchitect<br>Gentile Sine Bells is probably the one I use the most, but I figured I’d give glass bells a try for a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-04-27 03:40:47 Ckeyz<br>Hey man! cool song, I really like the melody. I think you could turn down the FX a bit in the drop, or EQ out the freq that conflicts with the melody. Also, by the end of the track the melody gets pretty overdone. I would encourage you to maybe even write a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to keep it interesting. Maybe add some more automation that actually makes the entire sound change.

However changing the instrument or adding and subtracting something keeps the vibe fresh and new.  I recently started using the rule of 8. Every 8 measure change something. Even if it's adding a new high hat or a small <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. It really helped me out. Keep doing what your doing though.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-29 03:41:04 ItsCheezyMusic<br>I like the vibe to this man 100%, I think I was waiting for maybe some sort of high <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to come in or maybe even a vocal sample. Either way man dope track.

Here’s my latest, it’s very different to yours haha

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-30 00:26:24 bbjaxon1<br>i really liked the beat, it definetly is sgp style. i would say that it is very repetitive though, and you could have made it better structurally, if you had sections that sounded more different instead of just taking the kick out and bringing it back. it would make it hit harder if you had sections where you take the drums out etc. also i think you could have made the part with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> longer. overall it was good though and i was happy to see a spg type beat instead of anothet juicewrld x trippie redd x travis scott type beat haha :)
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-30 00:32:18 dabdon1<br>Thank youuuu glad to see another spaceghostpurpp fan I’m 17 so he’s a bit before my time most of my friends only know him from the spaceghostpussy diss lmao. The <b><u>counter Melody</u></b> is actually part of a sample so I couldn’t take it out but I definitely hear you on the repetitiveness I’ll def work on that.

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-04-30 06:15:02 kristoffereidissen<br>Hard hitting drums! Could do with some sort of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> tho.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-04-30 10:27:17 smittyjr95<br>I listened to "angry bullet" and "box of chocolates." You're definitely good for only 2 months in, your melodies were better than mine were at that point. But your leveling needs a lot of work- the explosion sound that comes in on "angry bullet" is way too loud, it ruined the drop completely. the melody for angry bullet was definitely better than box of chocolates, for box of chocolates melody is cool but it sounds kinda bland, it would be better if you added a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something to it. Also triangle is too loud, you should definitely figure out how to mix drums. 

All in all, while you're certainly good for someone who's 2 months in, at this point I don't see enough to the point where a prominent artist will hear your beats and want to use them, just being honest. There so much competition these days as a producer and there are like 10s of thousands of producers hitting these artists up, and almost all of them are producing fire beats. I'd say wait man till you're like about a year in. It helps to wait, until you're really at your potential, to start putting your name out there. just my 2cents tho and obviously if you're confident enough in yourself, put your name out there!

I like the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you have in the second verse. It may benefit from incorporating it into the first verse as well. Also the melody you switch to midway through sounds really dope. Nice work.
</p></li><li><p><b>LofiHipHop</b> 2019-05-01 05:35:25 Hxgx011<br>It sounds really smooth, I vibe with it, the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> reminds me of Zelda ocarina of time.  
Maybe you should try to re arrange the song time-line, the last 10 seconds would sound interesting in the middle and then you hook it up with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and the rest of the other instruments...
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-05-01 13:55:15 sebas7639<br>loving this song! I've listened to it 4 times already to try to pick out some of the intricacies. 

Heres what i LOVE: 

\- Sound selection: The pluck <b><u>counter melody</u></b> pairs nicely with that sibilant synth lead. Kick and Bass nice and punchy

\- mixing wizadry: the tasteful use of low pass filters to add variation and help the buildup :Mwa: the octave pitching was also cool (and rather necessary since that synth is playing the same melody the whole time) it made it so that i was never bored of the main melody!  Loved how you also used reverb to make sure that the vocal melody was not outshined by the synth (Sometimes the synth is a bit to loud though).The panning is also great overall. Oh and i didn't forget that classy tape stop at 2:08....i feel like lm missing more things

My 2 cents: keep in mind i am john snow and i know nothing

The only thing that really kept this song from being a true banger is the buildup. The actual hook is good. All the parts are in, the bass is thumpin at full blast, its a good time.....but theres just something about the snare buildup

Possible things to try

\- automating the volume and reverb on that snare buildup( volume increasing while reverb is going from wet to dry!}

\- also adding a transient shaper to make it punch a little bit more towards the end

\- also recommending automating the global volume so that volume increases by at least 2db (or whatever feels good)

\- don't be scared to double that vocal like 30 times lol and pan them to add more depth and energy

\- i might be a complete nutjob...but the tempo feels too quick for me. I'm having a hard time trying to imagine how i would dance to this tempo in a club

After that....i think thats it. Cant really speak on the eq'ing since i am not in front of my monitors but sounds good (maybe the mids might need a little saturation} 

&amp;#x200B;

Ill be keeping my eye out for more of your songs! KEEP THEM COMING!!

oh ps: what DAW are you using? and what program do you use to make the visuals?
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-01 15:35:45 ItsCheezyMusic<br>Really solid base for a track but there’s no real structure to it, the melody was just constant and quite repetitive. Add a switch up for the 2nd half of the verse and/or the hook. 

Sometimes it’s a simple as throwing the melody up an octave, but try adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or maybe just some single notes here and there to add depth.

Here’s my latest instrumental:

Sliding bass was awesome and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> of that first synth was a head bop. Gonna drop it a like. Good job. 1 critique I have is the drums they don’t sound coherently chosen but that’s me nitpicking
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-02 17:01:18 VoM123<br>Thanks for the feedback 

I liked your beat was really chill the pad for the melody was nice and the drums had a good groove to go with the melody. I also liked the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you brought in around the 1 minute mark good to change it up for the listener. Nice work on the beat!
</p></li><li><p><b>trumpet</b> 2019-05-02 18:35:05 YCANTUSTFU<br>Basic:  

* Pads. Basically just play whole notes (long notes) that work over the chords being played. Just use your ears and you’ll find good notes. You can change notes when the chords change, and a nearby note (or often the same note again) will work great. If you start with simple long notes, you can easily embellish them later. Once you’ve picked some good notes for a section of the song, you can switch it up and add a simple repeated rhythm to those pitches instead of just holding single long notes. (Feel free to stop reading here and just do this much. It is often plenty!) 

* Double the melody. Don’t overdo it or you’ll get in the way and annoy the singers. You can just do this on certain sections, words, or phrases.

* Harmonize the melody (or parts of the melody)

* Fill-in in between phrases of the melody - at the ends of phrases after the melody arrives on its last note (word or syllable) before starting its next phrase. This can be a repetition of something that was just sung, or a short 1-bar or 2-bar improvisation, or a melodic idea of its own.

* Hits. For more upbeat songs, single-note hits or very short 2- or 3-note hits are great. These work much better when there is more than one horn.

* You will almost certainly jump in for the ending of the song. If it is a held (fermata) long note, pick a good note and hold it. Higher notes are good if it’s a strong ending. If the ending is strong but more abrupt (ending on a short note instead of a long note) just double the melody for the last word or few words, preferably in a higher octave. 

More advanced:

* Write horn lines as a counter-melody. This can be tricky because you want to stay out of the way of the vocals. A good rule is to play longer notes or rest when the main melody is moving around more, and play something more melodic and interesting when the vocal is singing long notes or resting. 

* Insert a section where the vocal rests and you take over. This can be an improvised solo, a written solo, or just repeating the same melody that was sung. 

* Mix and match all of the above. Do different things on different song sections. Verses are generally more subdued, and choruses are more energetic. You should sometimes/often be laying out altogether, especially during verses or quiet sections. Don’t go overboard. You absolutely do not need to come up with something to play on every section of the song. Even just playing during the choruses and at no other time would be fine.

General tips:

* Listen to recordings of the songs they want you to play on. Maybe go to a rehearsal and record everything so you can work on it later. This is the best way to familiarize yourself with the songs, make sure you know the keys for each song, etc. You can either write out actual horn parts (which is more advanced) or simply practice along with the recordings until you get some ideas. Whatever you come up with, *write it down*, even if you don’t know how to actually write a notated trumpet part. Even just writing down stuff like “play melody during intro,” “pads on verse 2,” fill in behind vocal,” etc. will be really helpful. You can write down what note to start on and other pitch information as a reminder (e.g. “start on E and come down.”)

* Two horns (or melodic instruments) are usually infinitely better than being the only one. So see if you can get someone else to join you: another trumpet, a saxophone, a trombone, or even a violin or harmonica. Anything to make you into a section so you’re not always a solo voice. You can trade off, play in unison, or come up with harmonies. It’s fun!

* Less is more. Don’t feel like you have to be playing the whole time. Adding horns to a song is like garnishing a dish. You are not the main course and the audience doesn’t need to taste you with every single bite of their meal.

Yeah I do hope my vocalist have time this weekend cause I would love getting a vocal. I think some of the synths  needs to be dialed back or start playing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Will hopefully update soon !
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-05-03 01:50:37 toxicantCircus<br>My only complaints are that the percussion section doesn't really \*hit\* all too well, and, as a couple other people mentioned, you'd be well served by mixing it up in some way cause right now it just sounds like a loop

Introduce some difference, like a counter-melody, a beat switch-up, or even a change to the chord progression

Perhaps add all three and/or a new instrument entirely

The spoken word bit really hit home, lovely stuff there as well
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-05-03 09:48:55 Wagnasty90<br>You could just listen to a few songs of the genre you want to try and try to replicate what you hear. If you really want to do it right you could learn to read music and try learning to play a drum set. That can be expensive though. 

For Trap drums I always try to use 2 snares or a snare and a clap. 808, kick, sometimes 2 kicks, 1-3 perks, high hat, open hat, 1-2 crashes, sometimes a reverse crash and sometimes a reversed high hat. 

IMO the 808 and kick need to carry the beat. You can either make your own 808 pattern/melody or have the 808 hit every time the kick hits. The melody of the 808 sounds good if you follow the bass notes in your melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Having a snare or clap hit on 2 every or every other bar is common. Then use the other snare or clap  to make a catchy rhythm that complements the kick. You can use the perk or perks to layer with the snare and claps or use them to complement the kick, snare, or clap. You can really add variation when you use perks. I always hit “fill in every two steps” and then go to the piano roll and hit Control+L to lengthen the notes and then use the slicer and draw tool to come up with a rhythm on the high hats. It sounds good to have rolls in a lower or higher note to give it even more variation and a little harmonics. Use the open hat to fill in space but you don’t always have to use one. I usually just put the crashes on the first and fourth bar but you don’t always have to use one. Sometimes I’ll make a rhythm with them but it just depends on if there is to much going on already or not. This is a good way to structure trap drums. 

I found this tutorial by Busyworksbeats that explains drums a little. 
https://youtu.be/4m5ud-jpOP4 

Here’s a beat I made with a lot of variation in the drums. Pretty simple stuff when you get the hang of it.

</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-05-04 03:48:22 galax-zs<br>Personally I would say making your own loops would be the end goal. But the easiest route would most DEFINITELY be sampling other people's melodies. But you should also practice music theory by throwing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something to go along with the sample, thats how I got so familiar with music theory personally. Once you're actually comfortable, I would suggest experimenting with your own melodies.
Good luck~
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-05-05 01:53:21 Graculus_<br>Sounds pretty good overall, kick and bass nice and balanced. Couple things you could do to add variation could be to

* scatter in one shots, FX, chants or samples to pronounce a change in mood.

This is dope as hell, only thing is,, there's no bass or 808!! I think, might have to give it another listen. But yeah musically it sounds repetitive, so i would kinda agree with EmiAze, UNLESS this is for a rapper. If there's gonna be vocals on this then really all you gotta do is add that bassline and you're finished? You definitely need both a melody and counter-melody though so i also agree with Emi on that. You have the chords, you just need a lead as well as the bassline. Use one sometimes, the other sometimes, both sometimes and the song will write itself :) It'll just sound right when you try different things :) Good luck! And if you have any more by now, i'd like to hear more! This is great :) It seems like you're inexperienced but have a pretty incredible ear and intuition. Good work

your track is really nice, i especially like the panning of the snares. If you wanted to add anything, i think a bell or synth pluck would work as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>
</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-05-06 00:28:12 Dr-Lite<br>Nice track man, really digging it.  That bass-line is nice and thick, it does clip at a point or two as someone else mentioned but I still really like it, probably my favorite part honestly.  Drums are on point, though not my cup of tea personally, I can recognize their quality; and general composition of the song works well. Piano was really enjoyable, and had a lot of emotion packed in.  
The only real criticism, and this is also a personal opinion, would be thinking about putting a 'lead' at the end of the tune instead of the morphed vocals.  I enjoyed the very beginning of that odd other-worldly sound, but I think composing some <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on a reallllll over-driven guitar sound (or something similar), would really give a crescendo to the piece.    
Overall Great Stuff!! Keep it coming!

I would try to highlight that melody by adding some piano chords right under it, nothing crazy just something that would fill out the beat a bit more. Maybe even a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.
Drums came in hard too, I really like the patterns and sound selection

</p></li><li><p><b>radiohead</b> 2019-05-06 11:06:19 ScottishCheese<br>From what I could hear, it sounded much more like the final version. At the very least, that first chord has to be a C#7. It’s a V7/vi that sets up the F#m, and then I think the bass walks down from the F# in F#m to an E to a D, so the chords would look something like C#7, F#m, F#m7/E, DM7. Not too sure about the F#m/E, the official version is in G and has a Bm/D, which would make this a C#m/E, so at least the bass I figured out should be correct.

Also, I figured the E in the chorus is probably a E/G#. I think the F#m could also be an F#/C#. These two changes make the chord changes much more subtle or stepwise or something; they’re much less jarring is what I’m trying to say I think. 

Honestly, from playing this more and more it seems like it’s not too far from the final version. I’ve been using the complete songbook they put out last year and a guitar chord sheet that’s based on earlier versions from like radio performances, and it seems like the biggest differences are the little counter-melody or whatever in the right hand and the key change.
</p></li><li><p><b>ThisIsOurMusic</b> 2019-05-06 23:40:02 h3tty<br>So the point of a drop is to go from a narrow range of high frequencies to sudden low frequencies. Because big low frequencies invoke danger because of evolution, it creates a dramatic effect. This is obviously not the rule, but it's a good starting concept. You pretty much kept everything at the same frequencies the whole time. Synth line hits right in the middle, the kick drum slightly below that, and then a hi hat and rim shot just above it. Basically your track stays somewhat stagnant the whole time with the sound spectrum that it occupies. Since right now everything is mostly occupying the middle, I'd suggest branching out lower and higher, or using EQing to create the effect.

I might choose a kick drum with a stronger attack (not deeper per se, but with more of a thud). Try arranging it a little, have the kick drop out instead of having just the hi hat drop out here or there. When you bring the kick drum back in, add something to your frequencies. Maybe double the synth melody line with another sound an octave higher, or maybe a high <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. You could also change up your hi hat rhythm at that point, make it busier. You could also EQ out any low frequencies from your synth and then add a bass. To increase dramatic effect for your "drop" you could also add in a louder snap or clap sample on the up beats. You'll hear a lot of edm tracks using sound effects or "wooshes" or what have you, those also serve to add drama and fill frequency ranges. You can download any of that for free from the internet if you dont have any samples. 

Your rhythm line (was it percussion or a synth?) was actually pretty dope, you should expand on that. I hope this helps at least somewhat, eveyone has their own opinions and style though.
</p></li><li><p><b>NDQ</b> 2019-05-07 02:21:25 spartantalk<br>There's stuff like this in classical music too. I can't quite recall the composer, but I played in a piece had the counter-melody was just off the beat. This was in HS and the biggest issue the band had in learning it was purposely being slightly off beat.

Having gone through all the production, it's more than likely to be on purpose.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-07 03:49:05 dickeddocks<br>Mix is pretty good, the melody sounds kind of flat. You could stereo separate the melody or the counter and make it sound more spaced out. You also did the thing where after the intro you introduce the 808s and the kick after that, but your intro was pretty long so when the 808 dropped I expected the kick to drop with it. You could shorten the intro a little so the listener does not have to wait as long to hear the real beef.

And like someone else suggested, 808s could be more punchy. It feels like the attack on them is too long. Melody is good and catchy and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is too. Good pattern with the hats and percs and claps.

Overall very nice beat, keep up the grind.

Your beat was intense. I love the strings! I’d love for that song to have a verse section where the arp is detuned and half speed so it gets out of the way of the vocal during that part and then the main section can be the hook. I’d love to hear some high slow strings be a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> when everything is going. Also I’d love the snare to layer with something a little more clappy or slappy so it has more of a thump to it. It made me think of the Ivan Drago training montage in Rocky IV when he is running really hard on the treadmill. Just intense and determined.

I love the video as the colors perfectly match the mental image I got listening to the track: sleek futuristic inner city.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-07 20:18:24 xiiibc<br>Nice man! Love the steel pans vibe. Maybe like one <b><u>counter melody</u></b> thing would be cool for a hook.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-05-08 04:26:01 kchen12<br>I really like this track!  Good vibes.  My only feedback is i think the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>/chord at 2:50 is a little quiet.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-08 19:02:35 hisfirewithin<br>Thank you! I agree it feels like it's missing something. There's a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> I left off the hook I might add back on. It answers the synth stab/guitar chords. That might be part of it. Thanks!
</p></li><li><p><b>songaweek</b> 2019-05-08 22:29:26 RhoXi<br>You started songaweek with no prior music knowledge? Dang, you seem to have a good grasp on music theory. Most people I try to teach guitar to eyes glaze over as soon as I mention any sort of interval. 

As for the song, I liked it for the most part but I think it could use a little more variety. Maybe a counter-melody on a different instrument or a dynamic change. Maybe give the bass guitar a little flourish here and there. It's those little touches that really bring a piece to life. Frankly, I struggle with that myself because it's hard to see the forest for the trees when you are laying it down.

Everything else was solid. Mix was good and your instrument choices sounded good too. I liked that little reverb-y thing during the chorus and the drum fills were nice. Overall very solid but perhaps just needs some polish.

On a side note; have you ever listened to C418? I think some of his piano oriented stuff might be right up your ally.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-09 07:27:51 justkevinthings<br>Really like the flow on this one man its definitely a headbobber I think mix-wise you should try sidechaining the kick to the melody and its volume a bit (the kick) to give it a bit more bounce. The plucks as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> are good and I think you should have them in a bit more but this is great!

Drums sound offbeat at first but grew on me the second listen. <b><u>Counter melody</u></b> over the break sounds dope.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-10 02:21:20 sk8ingisgud<br>This is hard. The melodies are spooky af. I would say maybe don't bring that second melody in right when the 808 comes in. The parts with the sub bass, higher pitched <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and all the drums sound really nice.

Here is my song. I made the beat, mixed it, and have second verse.

Im digging the vibe on this beat. The drum pattern is solid and those 808's really hit you in the chest lol. The melody is fine I wouldn't do anything to it but maybe add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on top of it. Maybe I choirs? Solid work, can definitely hear desiigner on this.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-10 18:22:17 BeatsByMak<br>Lol this sounds dope man, the melody is dope to and I like the little bells you got coming in over it sometimes, but maybe it needed abit of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> but if you ask me, that just gives the artist more room to flex their creativity, I'm not using headphones right now so I can't really comment on the mix but nothing bad jumped at me, good job

Where do you get drum samples from?

</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-05-15 04:32:49 jpmondx<br>I liked it. It’s not my genre, but I thought the construction was excellent with a good variety of themes and melody. There was a nice <b><u>counter melody</u></b> going on in the verse that I liked and wished it was a tad louder. Great musicianship and recording. I liked the softer tone of your guitar during your outro around 2:33, wish it lasted longer or was featured more in your song. Are you able to adjust your panning to widen your soundstage more? Everything sounds like it’s mainly coming from the center.

I’m a newbie here, so hope that was useful
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-05-15 12:26:31 KatsuStyleMusic<br>The other part of this that's just as important is understanding what role different stringed instruments play in an orchestra, and having an understanding of which part of the EQ spectrum each instrument sounds best in. This took me a while to figure out. I used to layer chords on top of chords in whatever- violins, violas...what the fuck even is a cello? I dunno, but they sound cool as fuck so I'ma throw in some of those sweet chords. Eventually I actually stopped and looked up what purpose each instrument plays, as well as EQ charts for them. 

Broadly speaking, violins will typically be reserved for top line stuff like melodies; I normally use violas for harmony; cellos can play root notes, harmonies, or I'll even write a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at a lower register in them; and the double bass plays, uh bass. Now this isn't a hard and fast rule, but using this as a guideline can make the whole thing a little bit easier when it comes to writing the parts and arranging them.

As far as EQ is concerned:

[http://www.independentrecording.net/irn/resources/freqchart/main\_display.htm](http://www.independentrecording.net/irn/resources/freqchart/main_display.htm)

This chart will tell you everything you need to know about practically any orchestral instrument, including an instrument's fundamentals, overtones, and what range it sounds the most full in.

Throw all this in with a good sample based VST or Kontakt instrument and some proper mixing and you're on your way. I personally use Eastwest's Hollywood Strings, Hollywood Solo Violin, and Hollywood Solo Cello (all available in their Composer Cloud service).

&amp;#x200B;

Credentials: I am obsessed with orchestral instrumentation and I put way too much strings in every song I make every time.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-05-15 17:32:53 boomsnap99<br>For me, when I'm producing,  I somehow  end up hearing a different  <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the background (specially when there are a bunch of layers to it) then I replay it in my head a few, and then reproduce it on fl
</p></li><li><p><b>songaweek</b> 2019-05-16 05:56:17 Waterbison<br>I listened to this while driving around town, and the tune suited that very well. Very relaxing in a thoughtful way. I personally wanted to hear the vocal line go somewhere else the second time through, just as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> presented in a call-and-response with the existing line. But, maybe you're going for more of a loop feeling, so take that with a grain of salt.


Overall I like the mood. Like another poster said, the leads could have their volumes balanced a little bit. But I'm still new to the mixing world myself.


I'm looking forward to hearing more from you. Nice work!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-05-16 05:59:53 earsablissin<br>If you like the sound of the chords without melody, usually it's because you like the bass movement. If you like the bass movement - that's already melodic content. Your musical taste and genre will judge the prominence of this line in the music.

But what that means is - you've kind of tied yourself down to a musical form through the bass. And adding whatever you think is a tasteful melody above that will be heavily effected and potentially limited by the bass movement if you're too rigid with that initial idea when you start adding a counter-melody. If you have a melody in bass, and a melody above, it's the melody above that will then be most noticeable and draw most attention. So it's important to recognise that.

The benefit to writing a top melody first is that the form is more open. You can play with an idea for a lot longer. And then harmonize it multiple ways. So there's a strong chance that a top line melody will be stronger off the bat. And might actually be easier and quicker.

There's nothing worse than sitting on a chord progression for ages trying to come up with a melody. A chord progression is just that - a nice progression. But it absolutely isn't the be all and end all of a song or piece. Well written music isn't just about an interesting progression - it's about everything else. So be careful getting stuck on chords, without considering the melody if you start with chords first.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-05-16 06:01:15 MunchiePea27<br>Definitely can picture Kyle on this, especially with the 808 and melody you made. That's what you're going for, so I think the execution is pretty solid. I'd say to add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in around the 1:00 mark.
Good stuff, especially for 2 months in. Keep working at it.
</p></li><li><p><b>Jazz</b> 2019-05-16 08:43:07 EtherealFeline<br>When you say the solo section is in 7, I assume you also mean that the melody/the rest of the piece isn't in 7? 

&amp;#x200B;

As a shit improviser (in all things) , my go-to trick for jazz solos is to start my solo with the melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that's found in my part anyways, and then proceed with variations on that theme/melody. If your non-solo phrasing isn't in 7 anyways though, my advice may just be a moot point...
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-16 08:59:03 bunchoflasagna<br>Lovin' the vibe, definitely getting an east coast feel to it, and that kick bounces. I'd probably add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, or introduce a new element a little more frequently to switch it up a bit. Overall, I dig it!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-16 14:25:55 SpencerChampion<br>The foundation of this beat is dope man it could maybe use a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or some more variation in the drums keep working hard and learning new shit!!

I'll simplify the patterns when I get some time and post the second demo. 

This is cool, although I feel your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would have been better off as a sin wave or something like that, it's almost too quiet and not got enough wiggle to it. 

The shaker is a nice addition, really ties things together.
</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-05-17 07:58:52 ChrispyFry<br>Not bad for two and a half months! Will say I think the rim hit is a little hard, and it could use a good <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Possibly a switch up but that’s all up to you I liked the 808 and main melody
</p></li><li><p><b>chiptunes</b> 2019-05-17 20:36:37 lightningrunaway<br>Well Im not exactly sure what you mean by NES style. I think the main thing that defined NES music is its limitations, 8 bit and 4 channels. So if you wanna make it that style and not eight bit I would recommend just limiting yourself to bass, drums, melody, and chords/<b><u>counter melody</u></b>. You can also download reaper which is free for 60 days and get NES VST.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-18 17:00:16 FilthyFrankCastle212<br>They're mostly intended for rappers. I know how important it is to create variation by chopping/adding/dropping various elements of the beat throughout it's duration, and I'd never just start piling on unnecessary synths, I rarely even do a counter-melody when I sample. 

Should I not worry about how many instruments are in the mix total in the end as long as the variation is there and everything sounds good and full?
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-05-18 19:26:08 shigz92<br>Perhaps a low pass filter fade in on the piano intro to 10 sec, then a bass fade in from 21 sec.

Adding another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or an extra 8 bars to the main melody in the second chorus to add some variation.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-20 00:06:40 dumbass_alex<br>thanks man, appreciate it. yo, your beat is really good, but to my ear bass is too loud and heavy on the low end, and maybe some counter-melody to the main one would be a nice addition to it, but besides that great beat.

A chord chart (or chart) is a form of musical notation that describes the basic harmonic and rhythmic information for a song or tune. It is the most common form of notation used by professional session musicians playing jazz or popular music. It is intended primarily for a rhythm section (usually consisting of piano, guitar, drums and bass). In these genres the musicians are expected to be able to improvise the individual notes used for the chords (the "voicing") and the appropriate ornamentation, <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or bassline.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/2a96cbd8b46e442fc41c2b86b821562f.png)  

&gt; With their latest album The Fear In Love, Dont Look Down have departed from the world of adolescent pop/punk, this time exploring a darker, less traveled road.  “There will always be some pop-punk influences there, but this is not a pop-punk record,” mulls front man Ryan Ogren, “It’s darker, lyrically and musically, than anything we have done in the past.”

&gt; Together since high school, and still only in their early twenties, Dont Look Down have earned their stripes as relentless road-dogs, sharing stages nationwide with the likes of Yellowcard, Simple Plan, RUFIO, New Found Glory and endless others since releasing their debut full-length Start The Show in early 2002. 

&gt; With their honest and evolving style (a compelling and unique blend of pop/punk energy and dark, driving rock....played with precision and intensity) and impressive appetite for touring, Dont Look Down's hard work was paying off: the band sold over 5,000 copies of their Five EP, produced by Will Salazar (Fenix TX), on their own in a matter of months, Nitro Records snapped them up in 2003 and recently matched the band up with Brian McTernan for their sophomore album. The Fear In Love is Dont Look Down's next step in their sonic evolution.

&gt; “We wanted there to be more of an emphasis on instrumentation on this record to show off our playing ability a bit more,” explains Ogren “We always want to keep challenging ourselves musically.”

&gt; Producer Brian McTernan (Thrice, Cave In, Hot Water Music) played an integral roll in Dont Look Down’s maturing sonic signature, bringing The Fear In Love a welcome sense of scale and depth-of-field without sacrificing the band’s emotive rough-edges or performance panache.  

&gt; Though all four members of Dont Look Down contribute to the writing process, Ogren remains their creative leader.  Music entered his life early. He grew up listening to the classic rock of Led Zeppelin and Guns ‘n Roses, before being impacted by the ‘new school’ punk of NOFX, MXPX and later the Ataris and New Found Glory.

&gt; More recently, musically ambitious influences like Thrice, Recover and Story of the Year have also influenced the songwriting which became The Fear In Love: the restless riffage and twin-guitar harmonizing of “Stages Of Dying,” juxtaposed against Ogren’s optimistic, cinematic vocal refrains; the ominous bass, interjected guitars and intricate counter-melody of opener “Right Where It Hurts;” and the shape-shifting guitar and drum assault of “Last Breath,” which sets up plaintive plateaus of hope and harmony.

&gt; Lyrically, The Fear In Love is at once a personal and universal document, relating what Dont Look Down have been through as a band to what we all experience in life and relationships: “The title, The Fear In Love refers to the fact that with anything involving love there’s always an aspect of fear,” says Ogren. “We love what we do but there’s no guarantee that it’s going to work out - just like with any relationship: you put in all you have, but in the back of your head you really don’t know what’s going to happen. You just have to hope for the best ...”

&gt; Having grown up together, Dont Look Down have a best friends’ chemistry on stage which can’t be manufactured, and, though they’re as energetic a band as you’ll see, they have too much respect for their music to let adrenaline overwhelm artistry:“We try to find some sort of medium between going off on stage and playing really well, being a really tight band ...we just try to go out there and play every show as if it is our last.”

&gt; A rare coming-together of youthful intensity, unique songwriting skill, fierce playing ability, and endless back-breaking roadwork: Dont Look Down have nothing to fear with The Fear In Love.

</p></li><li><p><b>ambientmusic</b> 2019-05-21 16:31:31 okem<br>Nice. I would've liked a little more kalimba without the fx, as a kind of melody / <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

The animation was great too. Did you make it?
</p></li><li><p><b>synthesizers</b> 2019-05-21 21:01:30 DNXPeeJay<br>A synthwave discord sounds dope! Ironically enough, I went straight to my DAW and took out Serum to mess around with a synth wave track and I never ran into any of my usual frequency clashing issues. Actually, I was able to layer 6 layers of serum synths at once (Bass, Hard Pad, Arp Pluck, Lead, Top Melody Pluck, <b><u>Counter Melody</u></b> Lead). I think my problem stems mostly from sound design; I really just want to be more consistent when making these types of tracks and get a solid grasp on what I know works and why it works and what I know doesn’t work and I shouldn’t try. For instance, what I did in this song was I had my cutoff filter fully open for most patches and would just modulate slowly downwards to get a sweeping a feel. This cleared up a lot of room. Sorry for rambling on again but I’ll DM you about the discord server now. Looks like you got dudes in that server who make the type of music I love and it would be a great opportunity to learn!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-22 05:01:33 dickeddocks<br>Mix is clean af and transition from just 808s to kick was smooth. Main melody &amp; <b><u>counter melody</u></b> can be louder. Hihats could be louder too. The into starts off too quiet imo. Drums are a little too simple, maybe you can mess around with some percs and fx's. Overall very good beat :)
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-22 12:51:17 FathomSwank<br>I fuck with the vocals they were mixed very well. Good bars and delivery too and the beat is cool. One thing I will say is even though he piano sample sounds good, i would want a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on it to add some variation. Even a subtle one would do imo. Solid work man!

Here's a beat I made today:

https://soundcloud.com/ayyyfathom/dismal/s-pZWVz
</p></li><li><p><b>PewdiepieSubmissions</b> 2019-05-22 17:35:55 MajesticClient7<br>The vocal melody is similar to the Stones' song, which was very similar to the Staples Singers' song, which was a traditional in the public domain.

When people think of "Bittersweet Symphony" though, they think of the violin <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, which was entirely the creation of The Verve's producer.

I don't know how much money The Verve should have made from this song, but as it stands, the one person who apparently raked in all the profits is the least deserving of it.
</p></li><li><p><b>tipofmytongue</b> 2019-05-22 20:06:36 Gonzo_Sauce<br>Also! For a chunk of the song, the singer wasn’t singing the actual melody, but like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>zelda</b> 2019-05-23 00:35:09 mmalluck<br>I like the end sequence where you realize that the "continue / save / retry" screen music was the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for the end game music.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-23 00:38:39 thefrenchyze<br>I like the beat! The sample is good! I would just add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or add some elements so it has variations otherwise good job man!

</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-05-23 11:32:34 Berserk__r<br>Boring as it might be, read as many guides to mixing and setting a sound stage as you can. Watch videos on how to create certain types or sounds, if you have the interest, sign up for some beginner music theory classes, they'll teach you WHY certain things sound pleasing. Melody, <b><u>Counter melody</u></b>, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>songaweek</b> 2019-05-23 21:58:47 RhoXi<br>Guitars: Yeah, I think I should have made the second guitar part fuzzier or add an effect to contrast it more. At the time I was more concerned with making it be a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>/riff.

Bass: For some reason, I have trouble making my bass parts stand out on small speakers. I've tried eqing the mid and high frequencies louder but that doesn't seem to help much. It's probably either the plugin I am using for the bass amp or the fact that I am using a short scale bass with flatwounds on it. I amp hoping to get a bass amp soon so we'll see how that goes.

Drums: I wish I could play set lol. Would make things so much easier. I just use the samples that came with Studio One and just tweak velocities for dynamics.

</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-05-24 02:51:30 olenDJ<br>Normally I put a soundgoodizer, then I would layer the sound (maybe add one more layer with lower volume but playing the <b><u>counter Melody</u></b>).
Then I would put the lead together with some chords.
And in the full song add a little white noise for transitions :)

I dig that drop, but i didn't rlly like that <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, the sound choice and/or melody doesn't seem to fit the beat. Everything else is good, keep at it buddy!

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-05-24 18:43:57 _mDubz<br>I feel like this could benefit from being a little faster as well as having a main <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to help compliment the hook/upbeat areas of the song and differentiate the beat into different parts. Keep up the good work!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-25 21:19:06 dumbass_alex<br>your piano is nice, but it gets pretty repetitive, counter-melody or some kind of filter would improve it, bass needs a little bit more energy, and it would be nice if you added some percs to spice things up, btw if you wanna try free shit there is LABS vst and Ample Guitar, they are pretty dope.

Of course you can add different chord combinations, drag basses etc, and add a certain amount of chords/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the right hand, but there really is only so much you can do in terms of ‘arranging’
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-05-26 07:29:39 littledevilkid<br>I like your mix down and how punchy your kick is but I think the snare is lacking a little.  Also the idea of the track is good but I feel like the drop just doesnt have enough elements, that screechy lead is cool but maybe you have a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> following the drums as a call &amp; response sort of thing?  Let me know if you need me to clarify!
</p></li><li><p><b>Breath_of_the_Wild</b> 2019-05-26 13:19:31 johnoftitor<br>Let's not forget the addition of syncopations in the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that add to the overall complexity of the music!
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-05-26 22:57:39 DanielDerg<br>yeah drop could have more elements, appreciate the feedback :)

do you have an example of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> which is following the drums?
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-05-26 23:18:31 sfz-sfffz<br>Play any rock song for your average person on the street and ask them to hum the bassline. They probably won't be able to, there's even a good chance they'll say "bass..line.....?" But play them that same song with no bass and they'll know it sounds off.

A kick drum isn't a bass line, it's one frequency (plus fundamentals etc), it doesn't add any harmonic content, it can't provide a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, it just goes thud-thud-thud. Look at the song Atlas by Battles, the bassist literally plays 1 note the whole time, but it harmonizes. They could've just used the kick drum but that wouldn't have nearly the same effect.

I detest pop music but that shit is nefarious and catchy. Plus, who ever wrote the instrumentation actually knew quite a lot about chord structure and put it on display with the electronic <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2019-05-27 21:59:01 Kramalimedov<br>Some very nice melodic idea,

The mix of flute and (harp or piano) work well

But the bassoon seems very underused. I would suggest either to sometimes give a more leading medloy to the basson, or to find a way to remove it completely. I think a trio woudl be more suitable for the sound density you seems to go for in this piece.

Maybe having 2 flutes that can alternate between melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> could be another option
</p></li><li><p><b>Techno</b> 2019-05-28 20:41:33 fuckman5<br>So, I think it's from Sasha - Xpander (the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that runs in the latter half of the track).

Drums are on point, love what you did with the panning, really gave them some nice bounce. Try to expand on the panning though, mainly on the hi-hats, modulate them so they pan left/right or equally left/right so they don't become repetitive. That's my only complaint, you've improved quite a bit since I last heard a beat from you.

Have been for four years, I’m in high school, so I may be bias but if ur honestly wondering I think a violas input would be good. Violas aren’t people who can’t play, I chose to be a viola, while yes some people switch or play both it’s not necessarily because they’re bad. Violas rarely get melody or solos unlike violins and cellos so there seen as less important but they’re not. We usually do get the background or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> but that’s just our part to play, the orchestra would sound worse without those parts. People don’t like us cause we aren’t the stars and they don’t like it when on the off chance we get a good part we can be cocky because we r excited 

TLDR: because we don’t get the main part so people think we’re less important
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-05-29 12:03:51 jl2112<br>This man isn’t gonna know what a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is. He just sampled this entire Khruangbin song and let it run.
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-05-29 16:31:49 E-Rico<br>I'm not a professional music theorist... there's always stuff to learn, so would you like to tell me what a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is?
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-05-30 02:26:52 jl2112<br>Nah man I’m criticizing you because right now this is plagiarism. You’re not asking “where should I chop the samples,” you’re asking for advice on adding effects to make the song “feel like an acid trip...”

I’ve read the comments here, and a lot of people are under the impression that you came up with these instrumental parts (ie. “come up with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to complement the main melody,” “you’re off to a good start, the song already sounds psychedelic,” and “the drum part is repetitive.”) It’s wrong to have people think that you came up with this music when in reality your “original work” is *maybe* 10% of what’s actually here. 

I’m salty because I see this all the time: weak ass “producers” using real musicians’ work with just sidechained drums added on top. It’s lazy and uncreative. A remix is fine, but “producing” music or “making a beat” involves more than overdubbing drums on an existing song.

</p></li><li><p><b>LetsTalkMusic</b> 2019-05-30 10:26:29 dumbbassist<br>Lots of very low bass pitches. Typically 808 basses. Typically a 16th note high-hat pattern with occasional 32nd and 64th note “blurbs” for the lack of a better term. Lots of triplets, in vocals, percussion, and instrumentals (especially vocals and high-hats). The melody is typically in a minor key and on the high end. There will also usually be some type of <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Also, it’s important to note that the best type of trap will have the instrumental working with the vocals. Often the instrumental will mimic the vocal rhythms (i.e. triplets as mentioned before). Also, if not in a minor key, locrian and phrygian are pretty common, as well as various oriental scales.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-30 13:26:13 pashtrenda<br>It honestly knocks. Vibey chords and I like how the triplet piano <b><u>counter melody</u></b> feels. It might be too busy for some rappers to go on but solid production imo

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-30 23:06:10 dickeddocks<br>Vibe is there fosho, you could turn the tempo down a little cuz its kinda fast for the mood. Mix is alright, but you could possible make a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> from that horn and change the notes up because the horn is slightly repetitive going through the entire beat.
</p></li><li><p><b>LetsTalkMusic</b> 2019-05-30 23:22:33 wildistherewind<br>To be fair, I think the 808 kick has had a lot of variations through history, it isn't one thing that stayed one thing. John Robie's studio prowess added clarity to "Planet Rock". A faulty 808 gave the Beastie Boys their ultra low bass sound. Miami Bass producers like Dynamix II exentuated the sound by extending the kick's note length. Finally, trap has resampled the 808 and the big break through has been raising and lowering the pitch to create a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, something you could never achieve with an 808 on its own.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-31 01:12:52 Uptowngrump<br>Sorry for the late response, life happened. 

Lol, don't worry that's not me on the vox. Personally no problem with type beat producers, just shitty ones. It's intentionally faded for the sound I want, but I am still toying with it to find the perfect fine tuning on that end, so thank you for your feedback, probably need to ease off a bit more.

 I toyed with some trap drums on this but nothing really stuck out to me, plus personally I like working with live drums like this, at least for this style. But I do agree, kick needs some more too it. Unfortunately when miking the drumset I was limited and couldn't have a separate kick mic, so it's been a game of chess getting it to come through well without fucking with the rest of the drum sound. Might double it with some boom bap kicks mixed to support the initial hit.

I can see you're not a shitty type beat producer. This is very well mixed, and definitely follows the style of both the artists you listed. It's not personally a style I would listen to on my own time, but you do it well. My only comment would be to maybe introduce a temporary <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at some with a different drum pattern, give room for a rapper to breakdown on the beat if they wanted to. That being said, idk if that's what that style is looking for in beats, so take that at your own discretion. Really impressive mixing overall, keep it up man.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-05-31 01:59:20 TheToppa<br>Damn this is pretty hard. I like the guitar that comes in later to act as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, sounds nice. I think your main melody is still a bit repetitive though, might wanna filter it some in different sections just to give it some progression. I think the 808 could come up a bit, it's kind of lost under the rest of the beat. Fix that up and this gonna be on point.

I love the guitar sample. The detuning on it sounds sick and Dave East flows so well on this beat. The mix is clean too but I would probably add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on some parts of the track.

4 specific types of feedback I'm looking for:

1. Does it need a beat drop? If so, how would you do it?
2. The mix is a new way I've started working on mixes, but I listened to it so much I don't know if my ears are fresh to catch the issues. Especially with the 808, which I'd love to know if you feel it's getting lost in the sauce when it's going.
3. The arrangement is also something new, as I flipped the Electric Piano into a slightly different structure and created a midi transform preset to do something similar to grossbeat on the top melody instruments to differentiate the verses, as I've been given previous feedback about being too repetitive.
4. Finally, with melodies, I've been doing a melody line on top, some chords underneath, and maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on some tracks. Is it too much? Is what I'm doing unique? Would love some feedback on what kind of "type" beat this would be, if any. It would help me work a little more on how I'll brand myself in the future. 

Thanks, and I will return feedback given.

so as you stated here is the 4 feedbacks you want to know

1) yup it needs a beat drop i would drop that mf like metro kicks , bass hats all together first two bars and then remove kick for third bar and bring the kick back at 4th but thats just my style

2 ) Mix sounds good on my cheap headphones however i would just lower the hats a bit but thats me

3) arrangement is good as i make my shit repetetive as hell i dont find this repetetive at all 

4) great <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you got there wym what kind of type beat its your own style man dont overthink
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-06-02 18:43:27 dumbass_alex<br>Melody gets pretty repetitive, maybe switching it up or adding new counter-melody would help, kicks and percs are too quiet, but besides that it's a nice beat, it just needs a little bit more polishing.

</p></li><li><p><b>futurebeatproducers</b> 2019-06-03 02:05:58 CitizenMagnificent<br>The mix is very clean. I like the chime melody. Good usage of fx, I really like the risers for 0:43 - 0:51. Seriously the drum work you going on is really good, groovy af. That snare you chose is especially clear too I like it.  My only suggestion overall is to maybe add a little more between 1:25-4:45, maybe just some more effects or a simple <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something just to make it less empty (unless that was your intention), Honestly hope this helped man!

</p></li><li><p><b>chiptunes</b> 2019-06-03 07:19:47 shiru8bit<br>Pretty good song, the one issue is that it is short indeed. At least a few bars of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would help it greatly.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-06-03 16:02:46 The_New_Rep<br>Chord progression and bounce are really nice, but I think the counter-melody could be improved, the sound choice and rhythm make it stick out a bit too much. There are also too many hi hat rolls, a beat like this can be really simple. 

I would actually try and make this beat a bit simpler and more laid back, simplify the hit hats, rewrite the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> so there's more space, *let it breathe*.

</p></li><li><p><b>futurebeatproducers</b> 2019-06-04 08:09:43 nocioniisgod<br>very nice chill beat. It sounds lovely. The sounds a great, they could just use some differentiating bits to make them a little more interesting. Automate the velocity on the hi hats and change up their sound from time to time to make them more fluid. Same as the guitar riff. It's a really nice riff but I just got a little bored. Maybe around 1:50 when the hi hats stop you could have a different instrument playing a similar to melody to the guitar, or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to it. Then the guitar comes back in and bam! more interesting.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-06-04 22:07:00 hisfirewithin<br>I LOVE THIS. It has a real lazy feel. SUPER chill. It's a feeling I don't hear in music enough. The one change I'd make is adding a monosynth in the sub bass range, but playing a trippy ass <b><u>counter melody</u></b> . I think the foundation would add to the chill.

I thought the melodies were very good, especially the strings <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the main synth melody. Everything was very well mixed. I had no issues with the beat personally, but if there is one change I think the beat would have benefitted from, I would say a more full and fatter bass would've have brought everything together even better. The bass in your beat was, in my opinion, a bit thin for how hard and energetic everything else was. Great job, though. Keep it up!

Bro, that first beat is fire. Needs to be cleaned up a bit mixing wise, and maybe add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>? Love the way it fades in at the start.

Personally think you should make a full beat with that first beat, switch up doesn't work too well as the melodies are too different.

I like the buildup a lot, however, I feel like the drop is kinda weak and it should hit harder for a Gunna feel. I like that <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you get going though, that sounds dope, and when you start messing around with the drums it gets even better. I like the distorted laughing sample you threw in there. I feel like the 808s are good, but they could be improved to be more bouncy, again, if you're going for a gunna feel. Overall a very tight beat, I fuck with it!!

So in the beginning I would EQ the snaps and bass to remove any high frequencies. The vocals battle with the synth sometimes, especially in the beginning. 

Vocals could also use some  light reverb and echo/delay quietly in the back, and a little EQ in the lower end to help it resonate.

The big hit at 1:38 is really cool, maybe add a bass <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or sub outlining the chords to warm it up a little. I listened from my phone so there may already be some there.

When the chorus comes in again at the end, maybe add a higher catchy syncopated synth that harmonizes with the chords, just something to fill the higher range while the vocals sit in the middle.

Nice work anyways! Really like the sound of the vocals!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-06-10 20:42:42 SimplyTheJester<br>There is no one way I write. 

First, my best stuff comes when I'm not even thinking about writing.  Which unfortunately means getting it down in some form for keeps is about as inconvenient as can be.  With this method, I usually hear everything but actual words.  Drums, bass, keys, guitars, melody, etc.  I just try to capture as much of it as I can.  But it really means putting my current life on hold for a good amount of time, so if I know I can't do that I usually don't even try or hum the basics (or even beat box) into my phone's voice recorder.  So melody or chords?  For this one, \*yes\*.

Second best method is collaboration.  Because I am not truly pulling a complete song (or at least complete verse, chorus, intro) from nowhere, this can be a bit more hunt and peck.  For one thing, I'd stepping over the collaboration if I tried to offer everything.  And collaboration is one of the best ways to not get in a rut because it challenges you to do things "not your way".

Then there's the third way, which is actually thinking about chords v. beat v. melody v. embellishments, etc.  This is probably the most valuable way to get out of a rut. Not as in can't write anything rut, but as in recognizing you are starting to write songs that are too similar.  90%+ of the time, these are throw away compositions.  I'm probably trying out something new.  So it could be that I've become bored with my chord progressions from pure inspiration.  So in that case, I'm writing chords first.  It is less about theory as it is breaking out songs I like and figuring out what it is I like about them and then writing a few of my own bits in similar fashion.  Then I toss them out and let them creep in naturally via the "first" method so it comes organically.

To me, that is what theory is.  Getting out of ruts by challenging yourself to try something that doesn't come naturally until your own version of it does.  I can't even imagine writing a song in a mathematical type of formula.

NEXT.

If you are having problems with chords, then don't think about chords.  Think about doing harmonies.  Not straight 3rds harmonies or even the same rhythmic pattern as your melody.  But complementing parts that can be a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  Start with your melody, then write a complementary melody.  Then write a third complementary melody.   You are in a sense, creating chords.

Or write diads instead of chords.  Diads allow a lot of freedom, but they usually imply a larger chord.  So you can then come back to it later and find the missing notes of the chord.  But don't force it either.  If the diads sound just fine, then leave it at that.

You can also try hookpad (Google that).  It is like those old rhythm machines where you'd push a button for a chord.  Just smash away and use your ear.  Hookpad is set up so that you will stay relatively pleasing to the ear.  But it can also be frustrating when you know what chord you want, but can't seem to find it in the options.  But is more for easy experimentation.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-06-11 03:44:35 random-guy-on-reddit<br>This is really good, just a bit simple. The chord progression is honestly incredible, I love the switch with the second chord. The melody is good, but gets kind of old after playing it so many times throughout the song. I’m glad you’re adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, it really needs that. Some vocals would also help in this front. As for production, the drops feel a little lacking. They need a bit more bass, a punchier kick, and a less harsh snap. A clap could work instead maybe.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-06-15 22:10:07 LittleMusicMaker<br>Hey man! I love your beat but like the person before me said, try adding some more elements to your beat to make it more dynamic. When you have less elements within your beat, it gets old really quickly. So that could be things like a different drum pattern every once in a while, a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, etc. Keep up the good work though! This is a good progress!

Some things I noticed: the 808 sounds a little muddy at times, you might want to rework the mix on it. Also for some reason the riser sound that you use seems to have a lower sound quality than the rest of the drums so when I hear it it sounds a little jarring. Also I think the beat gets a little repetitive at times, a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> might be a nice addition. Overall nice work!
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-06-16 23:04:21 Music_4ddiction<br>It's not bad bro. Pretty clean.

It gets pretty repetitive though. I would recommend removing parts of the drums here and there, and then bringing them back in at other times to add variation and interest. You could also play around with adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in places.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-06-17 02:12:22 ShxftCtrl<br>Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

The mix sounds super clean, did you mix it yourself? It's a solid beat I really don't think there's anything to critique honestly. I wish I had more to say so that this didn't seem like a low effort  post but it's very solid work. I like the vibe of the piano and the flute gives an nice <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Drums and percussion are on point as well. Dope work man.
</p></li><li><p><b>BluegrassGuitarAMA</b> 2019-06-17 04:01:27 Rokeley<br>I often do the walking bass thing on guitar, and often do it even with a bass player. The point of it is to provide movement within the music. I find that the the frequency ranges between the two instruments are different enough that it's not usually a problem. If it is a problem, you could always consider what options you have as a guitar player and what would be most appropriate for any particular song or instrumentation. You could take your walking bass lines into a mid/treble range to get out of the bass player's way if you find they are overlapping too much. We could bang out a rhythm on the chords, do fills in the spaces between the melody, provide some sort of counter-melody, or think of different textures and effects like tremolo, double stops, triads, strumming vs. picking, etc. Try to fill in things that are missing from the music.  I don't think there is any single right answer, you just need to use your ears and decide in the moment what the music needs.  Ultimately, though, the role of the guitar in a bluegrass ensemble is to provide the backing chords in a steady rhythm. It's hard to go wrong with the basic "boom-chicka". 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as listening, I don't have any specific recommendations other than to transcribe YOUR favourite recordings. If you dig what's going on, chances are that somebody else will too. If you're really stumbling with suggestions, you can never go wrong with the greats: Bill Monroe, Stanley Bros., Jimmy Martin, Ricky Skaggs, etc. There are many posts in various bluegrass subs where you can find many, many more suggestions than I could list here. Transcribing recordings is the BEST way, IMO, to learn the nuances of a particular player, group, or recording.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-06-17 05:08:14 SpencerChampion<br>alright ill try those out man thanks!
My suggestion for your beat would be to try and find a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> the goes well with it to add a little variation!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-06-17 08:47:25 Tingzorz<br>beautiful, haunting melody. the drum selection is solid, although I would choose a crispier 808 (but the distortion definitely sounds dope on it!). I like how you added a counter-melody using a flute, works well with trap beats nowadays. if I were you, I would cut out the low frequencies of each layer (except the bassline of course) with an EQ, just to make sure the final mix won't be muddy. feel free to pan your background layers to make the track wider. overall, this is a pretty good beat in my opinion, you have big potential considering the fact that you have been producing for 2 months only! keep it up!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-06-17 08:59:16 Music_4ddiction<br>Wow thanks bro! Yeah at this point any feedback is good so it's by no means stupid. Glad you enjoyed it

As far as yours, I like it too. It's very nice, and the only real problems I have with it are in the mix

First off, the bass has barely any low end. Not sure if you did that on purpose, but it would be nice for it to bump a bit more. Also the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> thing that comes in at 1:11 seems a little to loud, and there just seems to be a lot of stuff fighting for attention. When you're mixing you gotta be really choosy and precise. Not everything's going to be able to be heard in all its glory. 
Your drums seem fine overall as far as the mix, but I'd try going back and trying to EQ frequency sections of the melodic elements that clash with each other, to try and make each one be heard a bit better. Hopefully that makes sense and helps a bit.

But yeah, overall it's a nice beat. Keep at it!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-06-17 09:42:50 Music_4ddiction<br>Thanks so much bro, it really does mean a lot.

Your bit is nice, I like the vibe. the drums and melody are solid and the mix is nice. I feel like it gets just a bit too repetitive though. I would suggest adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> here and there just to add interest.

Also I feel like your 808's are kind of off. The notes are right and in key, but it sounds like you may be playing a 5th or a 7th up or something like that instead of in the tonic note. If you play it down in the tonic it makes it much more satisfying
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-06-17 23:09:21 z_prod<br>hey! some thoughts: from 0.12 till 0.23 your 808 sounds strange to me, almost off key. drums that come in at 0.24 could be louder, keys starting from 0.30 are too loud. i'd get rid of this section from 1.24 till 1.35 or alternatively add some <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, because having only drums and 808 playing for so long doesn't sound that great. i'd also bring up kick a good bit. arrangement is not very clear to me, sound selection could be better, same with repetitiveness. i like the idea though, just needs some improvements! if you have a moment, lmk what you think [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOBYMJLxRkw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOBYMJLxRkw)

</p></li><li><p><b>kpop</b> 2019-06-20 09:56:48 SirSX3<br>Exactly! Thank you so much. Repetitive choruses only works because of its relationship to the instrumentals, where each serves as a counter-melody to another. 
Also it would help if there is more variation between each chorus (something that previous RV releases actually excels at)
</p></li><li><p><b>Trombone</b> 2019-06-20 11:11:20 PatchyChestHair<br>1st(Lead): Not only plays high but more importantly leads the style. They are seated in front of the Lead trumpet, who is dictating the style, and the lead trombone helps bridge the gap between the two sections.

2nd: Usually the soloist but also has more difficult part depending on the tune. The lead player has the part that sounds most like the melody or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> but the 2nd’s part is usually just different enough that it sounds wrong or is hard to slot. Having a solid 2nd player is really beneficial for a section.

3rd: The 3rd’s job is to help connect the 1st and 2nd part harmonically to the Bass part(s). Yes, they fill out chords but also a lot of the time they double the 1st part down an octave. Having a player on 3rd part that plays out with a confident sound helps the Lead player out a lot.

Bass: Bass plays, well, the bass. Depending on the music, they are usually in their own world away from the rest of the section. They play lines that enhance the bass line and style and also double the bari sax. In trombone soli sections, they add the depth and warmth of sound to the sections voice. They Bass trombonist needs to not only be able to play independently from the rest of the section but also fit in and support the section when called for.

It also kind of got a bit boring, which I know is dumb to say cause that probably would t be the case if someone was actually rapping on it, but it would maybe be cool to throw in a mother <b><u>counter melody</u></b> when you have the halftime on your main sample

Or take the part you wrote for the piano that was all thick and dark, throw the melody notes onto the flutes, and introduce your next idea slowly in the string section.

Play with that scale and simply find your melody using only those notes. My latest projects melidy ia from A# and its arguably the best melody ive ever produced. 

Now to add to this when i needed a bridge i simpky used the 4th note in that scale which is D#. The 4th note is the sub dominant one and makes a good change up for the bridge or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. So we switch to D# and its keys and use those notes of D# to make the bridge.

Music theory is a lit of fun and makes it easy to write music that sound great and akways in tune.

I hope this helps someone branch iut more into the black keys.

&amp;#x200B;

I liked it. I liked the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you made to flow in the guitar, and I was hoping it was going to have its own section in a beat breakdown kind of way. It was there in the end but was short. You could consider layering the guitar with some other synth you can control more freely so that you can expand the top melody further cutting off the guitar. That's something I'm just suggesting as a fun experiment though.

My parents wanted me to but I thought it was dumb and drums were “cool” but I would have much more creativity making my own melodies along with the drum stuff I already know.

Just think when you’re making it how you can give certain spots emphasis by using the software 

Like for example, not sure how much it can relate to what you’re doing but

https://soundcloud.com/caspersp/evil-twins-prod-casper-25-ski-mask-x-juice-wrld-type-beat

I’ll just give some time stamps to minor things you may not immediately notice, and make a difference but I know are there simply cause I made the beat 😂

0:20 is some grossbeat added to the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> I added

0:25 I took one of the kicks I had layered all together, then boosted the lows and reversed it into the drop, there’s also a reverse crash in there too

0:26 like literally right after, there’s the undertakers bell. I’m sure you know what that is ofc but I just sampled it, keyed it, and put it faintly in the background 

0:39 I layered the guitar sample with a lowered version of it, and another normal pitch version of it that i added some Hardcore onto then made it super quiet 

I’m sure you get the point by now lol, minor changes can do a lot you just gotta get creative
</p></li><li><p><b>Jazz</b> 2019-06-27 03:00:37 TheDionysiac<br>I don't think it's as simple as communicating the harmony. With that many voices involved it becomes more of a texture, and for me, it ends up feeling like nothing I've ever heard. It's as if the voices cover the entire span of audible frequencies from bottom to top. Combine that effect with the way he handles key changes and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and I'm totally overwhelmed.

Not saying everyone has to feel the way I do about it, but I think it's pretty hard to argue that he didn't have good reason to employ such a massive number of tracks.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2019-06-27 04:17:06 Sestaro<br>I like the work. Some thoughts:

One thing from the composition standpoint: most marches are comprised of three parts: melody, counter-melody, motor. If there are dual countermelodies, it generally happens at the end. You can get more "bang for your buck" if you repeat a section, and layer the second countermelody in the second time, and maybe change the orchestration of the rest of the group.  Listen to this (the second strain of Sousa's "Washinton Post") - [https://youtu.be/Mxrh1CrMmTY?t=83](https://youtu.be/Mxrh1CrMmTY?t=83) In the score it is marked as just a regular repeat, but performance practice is to vary the repeats somehow. In this case, the instrumentation and dynamic were cut the first time through. You can write a similar thing into your piece. You have close to enough themes to make a full-length concert march if you plan your repeat structure and build variety in your orchestration.

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds like a wrong note in 37? The Eb in trombone vs. Db in trumpet doesn't really come off as extended harmony. Harmonies tend to be cluttered in m. 53-54.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the rest of the issues I see come from the orchestration:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Flute tends to be scored a bit low. For this style, you generally want to hover around F on top of the staff to the F around that. 

2) Concert Gb and Ab are two of the poorer sounding notes on the clarinet. Going from Ab to Bb in quick succession is problematic for younger players. I tend to also avoid that when writing for older players, especially since the alto sax can do that range with a bit more fluidity. I could recommend doubling flute at the octave (your original flute part would actually work quite well as a 1st clarinet part).

3) Tenor sax is often in the wrong range. Double horn or mid-range trombone. The top "easy" note is around a Bb in the staff. I would write from low concert F (below the staff) to F in the staff as a general guideline.

4) Consider adding low reeds (bass clarinet and bari sax) and using them to complement the woodwind choir color. Then you can write full passaged for WWs along and not be missing the bass voice.

5) Trombone tends to be a bit low for this style. Shoot for F in the staff to F above the staff. (In this key Db to Db may be better though). 

6) I would experiment with the traditional arrangement of tuba and horn in a downbeat-upbeat pattern. Many marches deviate from this and that's okay, just maybe something to play around with as you start. At a minimum, I would bump the tuba down an octave and look at changing it to where it resembles the timpani part a bit more. I tend to shoot for Bb below to staff to Bb/C in the staff for "general march" tuba.

&amp;#x200B;

In general, I would keep most of the instruments confined to within an octave or so unless there is a specific color or effect you're going for. Not bad to stray out of this to keep a melodic line conjunct, just don't go wandering out of the range for a long time unless you specifically want that sound. Nothing (with the exception of some tenor sax stuff) is "out of range", just uncharacteristic for the idiom and style you're writing in. Feel free to ask any clarifying questions!

This track was dope man, your individual sounds went really well together. The bird sound was dope as hell and different!

The light synth that came in at 38s was very nice and the melody too. 

My only criticism is the percs sounded too loud in the mix, but that’s about it.

Have to say I was waiting for another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for the hook or something, in a high octave like an intricate piano melody or something...but thats just me over complexing the beat.

Sick stuff man keep that up!
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-06-27 22:52:22 Kyuuga<br>It's basically a "counter-melody".   


A great example would be the bassline of "Californication" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers or the intro bassline of "Sweet Child O' Mine" by Guns N' Roses.  


People try to over complicate the term and add all sorts of terms to it but that's basically it...  


In all honesty, you don't "learn" counterpoint. You feel it and you create it. Obviously knowing theory helps immensely but it's mainly a creative thing...

</p></li><li><p><b>tranceproduction</b> 2019-06-29 06:16:42 evo_pak<br>I did consider having more pads and a sort of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the breakdown but just went with this for now. I think I will go over the whole track and see how I can make it more driving - I think one of the issues apart from the fills and (lack of) variation you mentioned is that the track sort of loses energy after the breakdown instead of gaining, even though the volume level goes up and more elements come in. This could maybe be fixed with some slight variation or maybe a few melody notes changed, or maybe go easier on the layering post drop. I shall def try implementing these suggestions :)
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-06-29 09:11:35 spookyghostface<br>I'm not sure what your point is. You don't need to educate me on counterpoint. OP has already specified that he means counterpoint in the strictest sense, not the broad "<b><u>counter melody</u></b>" definition.

You're exactly right, I was trying to make the latter halves of Verse 1 and Verse 2 sound more interesting because as new as I am, the less boring I can make my tracks is probably a good thing. The melody was a loop, and I've had mixed results when composing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the past (for example, I composed a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for my first beat, worked really well and got good comments for it, second beat I made a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and it wasn't even in the same key as the loop I'd used so it sounded like ass and I didn't even realise).

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-06-30 16:52:15 currentsound<br>From someone who remixes professionally for labels and independent artists, this is my process.

If it is a new song and not previously famous/well known song, I don't listen to the original song as I don't want to be influenced by it at all or it might sound too similar.

I listen to the A Capella only. I play just the piano along with it and first work out the key. Then I work out the melody by playing the melody by ear.

After I've worked out the vocal melody and key, I think of some chords that will work and start to play different chord progressions over it.

Once I have a killer/favorite chord progression, I write it down.

Then I work out a good <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that fits the vocal and the progression.

Then I think of the genre and sounds that would work well with my idea and with the style of the song and artist.

Then I make all the instruments and parts.

Then I add the drums to suit my instruments and parts and work on the arrangement.

I don't use any of the original parts except for the vocals.

When it's done I end up with an epic remix.

&amp;#x200B;

The only exception to this style of workflow is when it's a very famous well known song with a memorable instrumental riff/hook in which case I might choose to incorporate it into the remix.

&amp;#x200B;

You can hear some of my remixes on my website: [https://currentsound.com/](https://currentsound.com/)

It's hard to tell what songs were remixes because often the label or artist ends up preferring my remix to the original and it ends up becoming the original version.

&amp;#x200B;

These are all remixes that became the original:

Every song featuring or for The Gordon Brothers

Rob Gentilcore - Angel in the Sky

Chaviea - Inside of Me

DJ Tom Watson feat. Jessie P and Malody - Feel the Love

Mick - All the Way

The rest should be pretty obvious and say DJ Tom Watson remix in the title.

&amp;#x200B;

In saying that, when a song is not a remix, I work with the singe or rapper in person and work exactly the same way anyway by starting on the piano and playing while they sing or rap in the studio.
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-06-30 16:57:31 KrazyPandaPlays<br>I will use a melody loop as a base point to build off in order to practice all the other things, such as picking some drums that work, building a drum pattern to go with it, making a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, finding other sounds to fill space, arranging patterns to create an actual song

I may have "cheated" and used a melody loop but I made everything else, and got in some practice doing it.

I kept running into a wall trying to make my own, and wasn't able to progress anywhere, so I decided to use the loops for now while I learn and practice how to make them myself
</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriters</b> 2019-06-30 23:01:46 FurryMonkeyUK<br>I do like it, but sometimes it sounds like the 2nd vocal goes out, as if you work out the interval between the 2 vocal parts for the first note and then just apply that interval to all the others, and that obviously doesn't work.

I work out harmonies on a keyboard so I can hear it isolated and make sure it's a good <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  I think you just need to find your own approach to do that same thing.

I like it, but room for improvement.  That's to be expected though, if you've only just started out with harmonies.

Keep going - I look forward to hearing the improvements :)

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-07-01 23:49:27 BigBarmBeats<br>Typical process:

Make a loop. I pull up a piano sound and come up with some chords, and a top melody. Layer some sounds, maybe add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> later in the loop. Save as wave file.

Take the loop i made and stretch it out or shrink it if i want it to be faster or slower. Change the pitch. Add effects (EQ, Reverb, Delay, Detune ect.).  Once the melody give you the stank face you’re in business. 

Time for drums. Usually lay down a quick 2 step or 4 step hat. Add clap or snare (or both for layers). Add a kick pattern. Go back to the hats and add some sauce. Add a perc in between claps. Open hat. And whatever other percussion i feel like adding. 

Pick an 808. TUNE THAT MF. Find the key of the loop i made. Drop some sauce. Add extra sauce. Maybe a third helping of sauce if i want. In fact I usually pour the whole bottle of sauce on my 808s (to a fault). 

Level and mix. EQs, distortion, proper levels blah blah boring boring no one cares

Arrange. Usually ill throw a gross beat on the melody and have it fade out as a riser fades in and then the drums hit. Lots of different ways to arrange. Just make sure the beat switchs up without sounding too obvious is how i would put it. Build tension before drops. 

Then i check the mix, slap on my tag and bump that bitch before i upload

Right off the bat I really like the dely on the lead sound. Its interesting but easy to follow and sits nicely.

If you dont mind me asking, how did you make the riser effect at the transition? Or if you didnt make it, any good tips on where to find that kind of thing?

Only real feedback would be I'd like to see a section where the main medlodic line gets switched up a bit more, even if its not a full blown beat switch. Maybe let that chill <b><u>counter melody</u></b> stand in front more for a bit. Other than that, its spot on!

</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-07-11 02:56:08 thetwaz1<br>A few different options:

1. Triad, funky chords that don’t move around too much, like in your classic funk and soul stuff. Papa’s got a Brand New Bag for instance is way minimal on the guitar.

2. A three or four note rhythmic repeating melody, a la Superbad.

3. Spaced out, open chords, maybe with a wah or phaser. Sort of like Scooby Snacks.

4. Double up with the bass, harmonise with the bass or use a more intricate <b><u>counter melody</u></b> - this only works if everything is tighter than the trousers of an 80s Hair Metal band. Can’t Stop would be an example.

I like the hoover saw tooth bass, I would suggest trying out having it more like a long stab with a filter envelope on it to give it a bit of movement and bounce and trying out playing a different pattern of shorter notes.

Also there wasn't that much progression through to the second half of the song and you could try adding a high end pad <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the keys that comes in later in the song to keep it interesting.

Vocals could be use more presence in the mix.   
Bass / low-end is kinda hiding too.   
I guess, overall there is opportunity to crisp it up all over. 

  
Food for thought - A couple of low-octave kalimba type plucks or tuned &amp; pitch bend-ed toms could ad a lot as a backing / <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Like this sound - not the style, just the sound \_ [https://youtu.be/Obt-vLEJ8jo?t=58](https://youtu.be/Obt-vLEJ8jo?t=58)

xooxanthellae nailed it 

No.2 

&amp;#x200B;

Most old standards ( and quite a few of the newer tunes) are in a AABA form. Meaning same chords and same melody repeat twice - <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and different chords - first melody and chords again. There are plenty of deviations from this norm of course ( composers get bored) but this form is very comfortable and most of the tunes at jam sessions follow it. The other most common is AB or A A' ( forgotten the exact notation ) which is  Melody and chords - most of the same melody and chords with a different ending ( usually ,sometimes more variation)

&amp;#x200B;

Most famous AABA tune is " I got rhythm" - which is also the tune that made the I-vi\*-ii-V chord progression famous

The first AB or A A' tune I ever sang was " There will never be another you" and is a nice example of it.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S I-IV-ii-V is also nice in fairness

&amp;#x200B;

No.3

 Trio is typically Piano or Guitar , Bass , Drums . Most Quartets Lineup with Piano or Guitar , Bass , Drums and a Soloist ( so Sax , Trumpet ,Vocals , Vibraphone , whatever they want really )  or they'll have both Piano and Guitar and bass and drums.

Most soloists use the Soloist , Piano ,Bass Drums format.

&amp;#x200B;

Sidenote - One of the craziest modern quartets in my opinion is "Spirit Fingers" ( very intense but the music is amazing)

&amp;#x200B;

As to why they don't choose as many as possible. There's a few ways you could look at it. I'd say the biggest one ( other than financial viability ) would be that the communicative nature of comping ( so the way the pianist/guitarist would play chords , bass player would chose and play their notes and drummer would groove essentially - this is a very sloppy description I'll think about a better one later) is more rewarding in a smaller setup. The larger the band - usually - the more needs to be written down and the more is played exactly the same every time. 

With a smaller setup the players get to mess around with a melody more and make decisions on the fly. Check out the Michel Camilo trio play his tune " On fire " at the North Sea Jazz festival. After the melody is dealt with everything gets a lot looser and the guys start playing around within the solo sections - catching on to the new ideas the soloist brings forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Larger ensemble Jazz is beautiful but it is really is a different beast.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure how well I made my points. Hope this helps.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-07-14 08:37:43 smittyjr95<br>ok so honest criticism of that beat (is it yours?) is that the melody is pretty boring. For me personally, an 808 can be hard af and bouncy but it won't sound at it's full potential if the melody is boring. I would add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or some filler notes just to make the melody more dynamic and give it more movement. 

the 808 of that melody is off-key tho. I can't say for certain if the root note he's playing is offkey but the note that goes up at the end of the measure is not in the right key. It's pretty easy to obtain this type of sound man. Look for "zaytoven 808" as that is the 808 sample he is using, and using fruity fast dist if you're on fl to distort (or you can use camel crusher, a free plug-in) to achieve that sound.

What i dont like tho, and im coming straight to the point are the cuts at 0.35. They are coming seemingly out of nowhere and i honestly thought that my soundcloud is lagging or smth! 
But overall, cuz i dont wanna end it on a bad note, its a great track! I also like the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you introduced at the end of the song!

The bells (i think those are bells) play a really nice melody it got some creepy vibes to it! But i think the beat lacks some kind of variation!

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-07-15 08:54:22 KaiyoWTF<br>Honestly if you want to work around frequency overlapping get pro mb from fab filter. The objective would be to get the more important sounds to stand out. So make a list of the focus point elements in your track once the writing process is done. Once you have that the easiest approach is to use stems. So say you have a lead, you would multiband sidechain that lead on top of the next important sound.. let's say it's a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.. or an arp.. then you would bounce that down. Then sidechain that on top of your chords. Bounce that down. And sidechain that on top of your bass. Then bounce and sidechain that on top of a pad.. let's say that's the end of your instruments. Do the same for the percussions. Until you have all of your drums.. next maybe your vocals and sound effects.. then have vocal/sfx stem mb sidechained on top of your synths.. and then bounce down. Now have the drums stem sidechain on top of everything else.. it's not the fastest way for a quick wip.. but its the way with the least correction later on and will absolutely result in a much cleaner mix.. I recommend using slow attack and quick release.. and using ghost channel duplicates of each focus point idea as the trigger for multiband sidechain  to prevent latency issues... this process should be done after light eq  work. Like shaving off low end or high end or any dips or boosts. Once you get this method down. Your mixes will improve 5× over, I learned this process from a retired sound engineer who used to work for sony records as an in house mix engineer.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-07-16 01:26:59 unorthodoxbeatz<br>I was a really huge fan of the guitar sample in the melody! And the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> flowed really well with it. Good stuff!

</p></li><li><p><b>politics</b> 2019-07-17 13:14:00 p____p<br>&gt; The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble.

I couldn't remember that line from the song, but it sounded familiar. Indeed, that is the lyric. I thought it sounded dumb, and searched it. Here's what I got from genius.com:

&gt;The musical structure of G-Funk is such that the melody is ‘sung’ by the bass line, as opposed the bass line being an accompaniment to the melody (treble).

&gt;To expand further, in music, the treble is usually the melody. The bass is the low counter-melody and chord progression. The rhythm section is the percussion, or rhythm guitar. So if the rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble in G-Funk style, then they’re saying that this style is defined by a sound where the bass is the melody, the rhythm section provides the counter-melody, and treble is eliminated. Think of a jazz trio consisting of a trumpet, an upright bass and a drummer. Now get rid of the trumpet and give the bass player all the melody.

OK. Intriguing, I guess. But after all, rhythm is life, and life... is rhythm.

I guess this doesn't really relate to the topic at hand, but it was fun to get into another politics post about how dumb shit is and come out with some food for thought on a classic rap lyric from 94.

Some variation is on the motifs is probably needed even if you add automation, maybe add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to switch it up a bit. Other than that the track seems to be at a pretty low volume so maybe play around with the mixing a bit more?
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-07-17 18:14:00 oh_laurent<br>There's many ways to do that but the first few things that I noticed which could improve your overall track is the following:  
\- The clap/snare has very little/no body, try another sample  
\- Same with the 808's, try to add a pitch envelope to it with a short decay time like 15ms to give it some punch, if you can't... pick another one with more transients in the begining  
\- The melody is way too repetetive, I can't tell when does it starts nor ends and they way you structured your beat doesn't help with that either. A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is much needed.  
\- Automate the levels of your groups/master track to be -10dB for e.g. before and afther the chours
</p></li><li><p><b>ifyoulikeblank</b> 2019-07-17 19:20:08 ernmanic<br>It sounds great in my imagination... the combination of The Beach Boys' harmonies and the Beatles' great vocal tri-tones boggles the mind --- particularly if the vocal  harmonies add counter-melody shadings to an exquisitely pure Hendrix guitar solo line.

I would suggest to be careful with your harmony, there's a couple of clashes between the bass and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. But if you're into that that's cool!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-07-18 21:44:45 kiwipanda232<br>the sample and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is fucking dope.

</p></li><li><p><b>marchingband</b> 2019-07-19 01:58:00 WranglerDanger<br>Depends on the director, speed, etc. We played Holst' Mars (5/4), and did left foot on 1, right on 4. That's how the melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> ran, so using it plus high step was pretty awesome. If you weren't playing either of those, it was one step per beat. Alternating measures, your lead foot would be correct every other measure (basically counting to ten to make it even).
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-07-20 02:50:07 Psytrux<br>No, what he is saying is while making beats, add in an acapella to hear what your beats sound like to keep it minimalistic and not overly complicated. You wana leave room for your vocalists voice. If you have a bassline, a melody with 4 counter melodies and 16th note triplet hi hats with a drone pad and violins its too complicated and the artists voice gets drowned out, compared to a beat with 1 melody and a bassline that adds a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on the hook and goes away in the verse. Less is more.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-07-20 13:25:21 2deeds<br>This is wicked. I feel like Young Thug would go *off* on this. The artwork is awesome too.

The arrangement, melodies, drums, and everything are really good. Wouldn't change anything about that. It kept my attention throughout the entire track, and the melodies are already stuck in my head. 

I would say the bell(?) melodies, snare, and hi hats may just be slightly upfront in the mix. Sounds like a slight leveling issue, but that's just my opinion. Some people like their snares and hi hats really loud, so take that as you will. 

But I do feel like the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you got going on top of that sample is definitely a bit too upfront. Maybe someone else will weigh in on whether I'm crazy or not.

Either way, dope track. Nice work.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-07-20 18:42:06 doesdrums<br>Don't look for the same accompaniment, but rather a harmony or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  If you think that following the exact same melody line as the vocal sounds lame, then branch out. Give it some depth by adding subtle harmonies.

If that doesn't work, then break it down.  Key change,  Tempo change,  Go somewhere experimental... just make it relevant towards the end.

Shit, I'm a drummer, so take from this what you like.  Good luck. :)
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-07-22 03:06:56 Alpha-Bromega<br>The song sounds well mixed, all the instrumentation is very clear and audible. Writing my thoughts as I listen to the song, I think the drop drums are lacking punch. Especially the snare, it kind of sounds a bit flat. I personally would add a bit of reverb. The hi hats disappear during the drop. I'd probably add a crash or ride cymbal to it. A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on the drop would also add an additional layer of dimension since all three sound basically the same. The keys that come up during the last drop into the outro would benefit form a bit of movement with automation. 

Granted, never heard the original. Cheers!

&gt; # [Ducati in the eye of the needle: Dovi and Petrux between Brno and Austria, risking it all](https://www.gpone.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/blog/Paolo%20Scalera/07-July/ducati-honda-brno1.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; "**Two weeks from the reopening of hostilities, destination BRNO, Grand Prix of the Czech Republic.**  
&gt; And also **the last circuit on which Ducati won twice last year with Dovizioso and Lorenzo,** in the sprint, and Marquez in the wake.
&gt; 
&gt; We doubt that the Ducati can repeat itself this year in identical conditions, especially since Marc's advantage in terms of points, -58, is such that he can't allow himself to wait on races.
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, **Ducati has a chance, during the next two Grand Prix races** - the Red Bull Ring after Brno - **to shorten the gap** with the Honda champion before racing again at home, in Misano, on September 15th.
&gt; 
&gt; **If Dovi, with a steady hand - and why not Petrux, too? - will be able to pass this triad through the crown of the needle, maybe the MotoGP could reopen,** otherwise, we'll have to regretfully admit that the championship is over and prepare for and participate in a triumphant show that could crown Marc Marquez world champion for the eight time even before the autumn triad.
&gt; 
&gt; **Statistics show that, in 2018, during nine successive races** - Brno, Red Bull Ring, Misano, Aragon, Buriram, Motegi, Phillip Island, Sepang, and Valencia - **Ducati collected 4 victories and 9 podiums.**
&gt; 
&gt; For his part, Magic Marc **won in Aragon, Buriram, Motegi, and Sepang,** climbing onto the podium 7 times.
&gt; 
&gt; **The title is, therefore, still up for grabs, provided that the Ducati heads straight into the eye of the needle**, without hesitation, winning three victories that, with a "Little help from my Friends", like the Beatles sang, will help him get closer to the Honda champion.
&gt; 
&gt; Friends like **Alex Rins, Maverick Vinales, Fabio** **Quartararo** and, why not, the long-awaited **Valentino Rossi.**
&gt; 
&gt; An impetuous ascent that is definitely (technically) possible for the Ducati **if Andrea Dovizioso will stop complaining about** the technical inferiority of the GP19 and Danilo Petrucci would stop singing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.
&gt; 
&gt; And to think that **the 2020 motorcycle market will also depend on this championship finale** - a long sprint, using **the rider's favorite term.**
&gt; 
&gt; That's right. Since the very first days of next year, with all the main protagonists of the MotoGP that have expiring contracts, the race towards grabbing the best rider will start soon... very soon.
&gt; 
&gt; And among the riders of the teams on the field, at the moment, it's not the Ducati duo that has more of a chance of a contract renewal.  
&gt; At least, not at the present value.
&gt; 
&gt; _What would you think if I sang out of tune?  
&gt; Would you stand up and walk out on me?  
&gt; Lend me your ears, and I'll sing you a song,  
&gt; and I'll try not to sing out of key..._
&gt; 
&gt; .

Your hats are fire and I really dig the kick, but i think that clap could be a little more rounded out; maybe just 1 more layer of a little bit higher freq.
I really dig the visuals, so many beats out there have a very uninteresting visuals for their Youtube posts, so that's rad.
Also, i would love to hear a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> come in at some point, doesnt even have to be a new sound. All around i dig it hella, keep on doin it g. Excited to hear the rest of this challenge.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-07-23 06:11:24 currentlycryingblood<br>I dig it. Love the synth/guitar interplay- bass is on point too. Love whatever effect you have going on the hats, but would love to hear more variation. You got some good bounce, I think some spicy hats could help you keep it going during the bass/drum breakdown. A light piano/whatever <b><u>counter melody</u></b> during the guitar and synth solo parts might be fun to try as well
</p></li><li><p><b>UnresolvedMysteries</b> 2019-07-23 12:41:08 church_of_cod<br>But there is no counterpoint in the Brahms. Every bar is melody with accompaniment (which is somewhat more varied than Brown's usual accompaniments but still, for long stretches, is a crotchet on each beat).

That is another weakness of her works - there is **no** counterpoint! A melody is invariably presented standing out as itself; there is never any counter-melody with which it can interact.

As I said in the selftext, the harmony is much more interesting and certainly sounds Brahmsian - it is instantly recognisable. I think the B minor work is an unusually good example; there are many Brown pieces I have listened to where Chopin could be Brahms, Liszt could be Schumann and so on. (And the performance reminds me of what a good pianist Peter Katin was - it has that combination of forward motion and rubato which is very hard to get right).

On the other point I make the "YouTube commenters remark" which I deleted from the selftext because it was a bit below the belt - where are all the Intermezzi, Etudes, Album Leaves and who knows what from all those people who profess they could do better?

I have run big newspaper searches and, rather to my surprise, have never found any other Rosemary Brown-type individuals. (And the United Kingdom has periodic spates of psychics and spiritualists - when I was growing up the "is there a Fred Bloggs in the audience?" type, followed by a stream of purported anecdotes about Fred, was common). That suggests that her method of producing her compositions, no matter what it actually was, was not easy.

sorry for the delay, ended up crashing early yesterday. listening real quiet cus its early so im not really able to judge the bass well. i think i wouldve brought in some other sound or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at some point to keep it more interesting or progress the beat as it gets longer. the drums still cut through really well even tho im not listening high and the melodies werent harsh or anything mix wise.
</p></li><li><p><b>synthwaveproducers</b> 2019-07-24 10:45:38 K3rbkrawler<br>I would say just keep writing if you get stuck, you clearly can finish songs, but if you are having difficulty finishing something move on and come back to it later.

Here an idea on Bullet Train, when you have the brassy lead going towards the end have you tried putting the drums in double time to give more energy. change it up maybe add a desecending <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.? The lead sound in verse in chorus sounds pretty similar, maybe look at changing one of those to provide more variety. Good luck!

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2019-07-26 09:36:16 tabletopcomposer<br>The key is to think of your A section and B section as complementary.  You want to  balance familiarity and contrast. One thing I like to do is write a <b><u>counter Melody</u></b> for the A section and then use that for the B section Melody. This usually works well and even helps everything flow smoothly if you repeat it as a <b><u>counter Melody</u></b> into the return of your A section.

I really like the drums on your beat, however i think you need to make the melody more interesting to the listener, it just gets repetitive over time and it doesnt have a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>! apart from that nice track!
</p></li><li><p><b>MusicInTheMaking</b> 2019-07-26 10:25:21 CaliBrewed<br>Pretty good beat homie. I produce as well. I think a B-section and defined bridge would do that track wonders. Also, I love the way the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> sits in the mix but it is a bit inconsistent. It repeats twice then goes into solo mode and does its own thing for like 8 bars. That's a hard one to make work in hip hop, though it can be done. Very nice work though, write on!

</p></li><li><p><b>MusicInTheMaking</b> 2019-07-26 19:09:47 prodbyrecon<br>Thank you brother, I appreciate the feedback! The piano <b><u>counter melody</u></b> comes in on the hook part of the track but I get what you mean with it being inconsistent, I'll try and work out ways of making it flow a bit better. What's your soundcloud man I wouldn't mind listening to your stuff!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2019-07-26 19:43:55 tabletopcomposer<br>A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is a type of harmony. Instead of just chords for harmony, you have a second melody that plays along with your primary melody. They can be tricky to get right when you first try them, and a poorly written one will only muddy up you piece, but if you practice, they can be a beautiful way to develop your music! 

A good way to make sure your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is well written is to make sure it's different in a few ways from your original melody. The number one important rule is that the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and melody alternate when they are playing. For example, the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is active when the melody rests (either doesn't play or is holding a longer note). When the melody IS active (has quarter notes or faster) then the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> should be resting (playing half notes or slower). Of course though, rules are meant to be broken in music, so if you don't want to do that, try to include at least 2 or 3 of the following differences to help things work: 

1) Rhythmically Different- If your melody is a bit on the faster side (e.g., lots of eighth notes) then make sure your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is on the slower side. 

2) Range- write your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the octave above or below your original melody

3) tone color- use different instruments for your <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and melody (e.g., violins in the melody and horns in the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>)

4) Articulation- use different articulations/styles in your two melodies (e.g,. one is very flowy, and the other is very sharp and bouncy)

I hope this helps!

The simplest way to start is to continue the same line in the next segment with a new instrument. As you progress, add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the next segment to change things up. 

Thinking of a song as content can help. Content tells a story. Put yourself in the perspective of the listener and take them through the story of your song, section by section. One day, you will just break through it and this becomes second nature.

  Melody line first. And learning the melody line should be part of any song you sing in chorus. Otherwise you’ll never know how to balance a chord. 

  Bass line next.  
   Tenor should follow hanging above the lead line. 
  Baritone fills in.  And weirdly enough, with practice even the baritone part can be heard by ear. 

Baritone line I think of as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. When leads are high, it dips lower and if leads are low, the notes are just above.  

Don’t go nuts trying to teach a difficult tag no matter how great it sounds. 
The emphasis is on the ringing sound which makes even the simplest tag fun to sing.

If anything, I think you have plenty of room to add something here if you wanted, but if simplicity was a compositional choice it's a good one.

" As a listener I'd like to hear more definition to the different parts, more recognizable transitions. As a producer I'm impressed by your drums and am taking note!"

Maybe try add a counter-melody in parts to keep it interesting. This mix has a good amount of movement that I feel you can be creative with what and how you add it (fast/slow and low/high pitched notes).

Add 808. Add claps, snares, and secondary percussion. Glue drums together with hats last. Mix down melody, mix down drums. Structure beat. Hope this helps.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-07-29 11:57:23 razbarry33<br>Kudos to giving out lots of quality feedback. Sorry you didn't get much back but I'll try to return the favor in one post.

Preface: brutal honesty ahead. I hope you take it well, but you don't get better being lied to.

The first thing I noticed was that the mix really needs a whole rework, and I'll explain more about that after.

I think the biggest weakness in this song is the sections leading up to the drop. With the lack of content in this song it does not need to be 4+ minutes. Here's some things I'd suggest:

- Take out :15-:45. The intro goes on for too long without offering too much variation. :30-:45 is pretty boring on it's own, it needs the melody to build anticipation. By condensing it, you can hold the listener's attention with more change in less time. 

- 1:00-1:15. It's a decent mixup from the section before but is just missing something to really make it interesting. Perhaps add another chord layer? Also the added pluck layer doesn't fit too well.

- 1:15-1:30. This part is actually one of the better done sections compared to the rest of the song. The only thing I would note is to end the build a bar before the drop begins and make a fill to carry the transition through. This is commonly done for a good reason. It breaks the tension and allows for a breather to let the listener know the drop is pretty much arrived.

- The drop is decent. It doesn't sound very original, but the chosen sounds work well together. The melody is average, it works, but it's not super interesting. What doesn't work is repeating it 3 times ~~and not changing anything. Make it easier on yourself, remove 1 repetition and change something going into the 2nd loop.~~ It can be changing the melody or the sound, or adding percussion or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. It can be anything. I noticed the change. Problem is I only noticed it after looking for it.

- The second half is composed much better than the first, the strings are a really nice touch. But the same stuff mentioned above still apply. 

Now to back up everything I've talked about listen to this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbWnxKPsH_E

It's not the same genre, I know, but it's house and it has the same song structure as yours. Notice the changes between sections are much more pronounced. Next time you produce, drag a song you like into your DAW and copy the changes, but reskin the sounds and make your own chords and melodies so it still sounds like you. Pay attention to how and when sounds start and end.

Now for the mix.

Actually most of your sounds work well together (with the exception of the pluck at 1:00), but I would definitely choose better drum samples. They sound really flat and uninteresting. Try layering samples can also work wonders here as long as you cut away the weak parts of the samples. Along with sample selection, is composition. Try playing things in different octaves to occupy different spaces.

I would work on sample selection first and foremost, but some quick points about how the song itself is mixed:

- Drums are too quiet
- :45 Strings melody too quiet and could benefit from width
- 1:00 Pluck melody too loud and could be more mono
- Overall, effects need to be turned down
- 1:30 cut some mids from chords, add some mids to lead, also add highs to lead so it's the most upfront thing in the mix
- 3:00~ cut lows from chords to make room from drums
- Use saturation on everything. Keep using it until you learn when it's not needed. It's honestly one of the most important tools along with eq and compression.

I hope all this isn't too overwhelming! Sorry if this heart-breaking as I know you spent a lot of time on it. I just know now that when I was starting out, people who commented "nice track" on my shitty loops weren't helping. Keep at it!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-07-29 16:51:26 soundofyogi<br>To answer my curiosity, what's the instrument you are playing? and what's the instrument of melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on the section your band leader wants you to fill?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-07-29 16:58:18 Jongtr<br>Essentially you need a second <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  I don't necessarily agree with [M3talguitari5t](https://www.reddit.com/user/M3talguitari5t/) that you shouldn't be "stealing the show" - maybe that's what your director wants you to do?  I.e., your line should probably stand out as the lead line, over and above the existing melodies.  That would be the point of a "solo".  Otherwise, if he just wanted you to blend in, he would have asked you to simply write an additional <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

You don't say what instrument you play, but the easy way to stand out above the current melody is simply to play higher.  If you can do that, you don't need anything fancy - just follow chord tones in a different way from how the other melodies are.  But you probably also want some kind of dynamic or rhythmic interest - to make your playing sound *individual, expressive.*   Whatever you play should be more *rhythmically active* \- not necessarily more notes, or faster, but more *syncopation.*
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-07-30 07:21:03 ItsYungBeethoven<br>Hey! My main gripe with this beat is the 808. It stand out so much but unfortunately it doesnt really play anything interesting, it just BOOMs into your face! Give it more bounce! Same goes for the drums! Make them more interesting! 
I think the whole beat would benefit from some sort of variation. The 808 obviously. but the main melody aswell, you could introduce a different main melody, maybe halftime it, or throw a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on top of it!
Other than that its a solid beat! Well done!

Heres my song i dropped recently!

</p></li><li><p><b>FLStudioBeginners</b> 2019-07-30 08:00:35 grosbeats<br>I always wanted to create full tracks when I started out. But one main thing was stopping me. I could create a second melody, so my beat always sounded pretty lame and lacking progressions. So I stuck to making 8-16 second loops and then dropping it there.

The process to make a beat is often creating a really good, and overloaded, loop/pattern and then arranging it so that your previous loop pattern is the hook and removing elements for bridges/intros/verses/outros.

Without an exciting loop, and without layering melodies it's hard to create a good beat. So my main advice is that, stick to making loops, and one day you're going to end up creating a dope track and that's how your roadblock is going to fade away, I doubt any piece of advice can force that wall down for you. The wall is there for a reason, and part of that reason is that you're self aware enough to criticize your beat and not just release it half-assed like I see too many young producers do.

Going back to my own issues when I started, the main problem was my transitions, I'd have a melody A and counter-melody B, and both sounded alright when they were together, but the transition from A to A+B always felt awkward, inorganic, and overall trash. So that's when I started focusing on creating custom risers to ease out the transition.

I'd create these risers by playing a small sample of my B melody, putting it through a bunch of Reverb, and then reversing it. It would create something for the listener to apprehend the switch up.

Lo and behold, by the time I got good at making risers, maybe 4-5 beats later, my melody skills also improved since I continued practicing, and I got my first A to A+B melody transition sounding flawless (at least, for my standards back then).

The main takeaway from this story is: try to pinpoint something that fails during your arrangement, and focus your energy towards patching that, or at least understanding what caused it to be trash.

-

I think focusing on finishing a track itself might hold you back, focus on creating something catchy and something you enjoy listening to. After that you only have to strip away some elements to create a progression, maybe take melodies an octave down or higher at some moments, but that's pretty much it for me!

Feel free to ask any question, I feel like I touched a lot of points but maybe it doesn't fully answer your question!

Good luck with your future tracks!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-07-30 20:23:59 skunkdaddy420<br>drums are nice but the kick needs to hit harder, also not feeling the 808. i like the melody though it could use some <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to it because it does get kinda boring. other than that nice work keep it up
</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2019-07-31 01:32:29 YesThisIsSam<br>Could also be a Cmaj7add6! Love that about music. But ultimately due to the tight grouping and the syncopation I think it's better thought of as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> than a chord.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-08-01 00:54:08 AskeGW<br>People are giving you a lot of different advice which is good, but here is mine. Your 808s or bass line should indeed be a melody of its own, in harmony with your lead melodies. This is hard to do if you're having trouble creating two different melodies that sound good together. 

This is what works for me. Usually I'll create the first melody and have it play on repeat in the piano roll (using FL Studio). Then as its playing I'll hit different notes on the little digital piano on the left side to see what sounds good and begin creating a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. It's difficult to play a good melody live on the go if you don't already play the piano, especially by clicking inside FL, but just pick a single note that harmonises with your first melody and play it in sync with the beat (switch on the metronome). Then go up or down a notch and pick other notes that match first and foremost the key and secondly the vibe that you're going for. 

I've found that you don't really need to know anything about keys or scales to make nice melodies, though I'd certainly recommend looking into it. By having your first melody playing in the background, you can pick which notes sound good and avoid those that clash. You won't know what key your song is in, but at least it'll be in a key. Then simply draw in the melody using the grid as a guideline. I usually draw a little bit and then repeatedly start the playback again and again to slowly progress and structure my melody, refining and positioning notes so it eventually sounds how I imagined. 

When you've got this stuff down about creating harmonious melodies and being able to assess which notes sound good together (you'll find there are patterns), creating a good bass line becomes a lot easier.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-08-01 01:00:56 foodie487<br>I mean the pattern? How do I make a compelling <b><u>counter melody</u></b> using 808s?
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-08-01 02:53:50 IFreakyZz<br>Yess exacly just listen to the sample i most of the time try and guess my rote note of like the note that sounds like the melody for example if the sample is high freq i know its gonna be in like G ir above and if the sample is low freq below that thats orerty much it just play around with it it takes time to learn how to make 808 patterns by ear but youll get the hang of it btw ive been making beats for almost 2 years now ive found that with more time you get more confidence in finding the rote note cause youve done it so many times so yea even i still dont find them by ears every single sample so im still a work in progress what i can recommend is keep going and if you really cant find it pull up newtone load the sample your working with and there is an option to send it to your samples channel that would make it easier also you can use that same channel to add <b><u>counter melody</u></b> so yea i just gave you some sauce right there
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-01 06:40:24 MaggaraMarine<br>&gt;Except they aren’t the same.

Changing the place of one note and changing another note to a different one (that really doesn't impact the harmony) doesn't make something different.

&gt;And under pressure is an awful example because it was the exact same.

It wasn't - Ice Ice Baby has an added 8th note in it. But my point is exactly this - a minor change doesn't make something different.

&gt;They both are derivative lazy songs with shit writers.

Doesn't matter.

The melodies are the same, and since that melody is in a central part in both songs, it is fair to argue that it is the "melody" of both of the songs. (Though the Katy Perry song also has some other melodies in it, but this particular melody is an important part of the "drop".)

&gt;You can’t copyright a tempo. The beats are  different. You think you can copyright a drum beat? Guess that’s the end of drums.

I never said you can. I said that all of those elements combined together is what contributes to the songs sounding even more similar. The drum beat alone isn't copyrightable, true. The tempo alone isn't copyrightable, true. But both of these in combination with the melody (that is the same) creates a sound that makes the songs sound even closer to each other. My point is, the context in which these melodies are used is very similar. If I wrote a slow piano ballad that somehow managed to hide this melody in it - for example it was some kind of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, nobody would say it sounds anywhere close to either of these songs.

&gt;Also, just because two people wrote a lazy ass synth part that actually  have differences in progression and tone, doesn’t make it the same.

First you talk about how you can't copyright drum beats or tempo, but now the tone of the synth is somehow relevant? The tone of the synth doesn't change anything - it's the same exact melody and has the same exact function in both pieces. Yes, it is a simple part. But that doesn't change the fact that it is the same melody. (Again, changing the place of one note and changing another note to a different one doesn't make it a different melody, just like adding an extra 8th note in the end of a bassline doesn't make it a different bassline.)

&gt;Further Beastie Bors already established you can’t copyright a chord progression.

This isn't a chord progression, it's a melody. Again, irrelevant.

Again, I'm not arguing that Katy Perry deserved to be sued over this. All I'm saying is that the melodies (regardless of how simple they are) in both of these songs are basically the same. And admitting that they are basically the same melody shouldn't affect anything. You don't win a case by denying reality (well, actually, I guess you do - but I would say if your argument depends on denying reality, it's not a very strong argument), you win it by presenting evidence that the part that sounds similar is insignificant/generic enough not to be copyrightable. This is what Led Zeppelin did with their Stairway to Heaven lawsuit, and this is why they won. There's no denying the fact that the intro of Taurus and Stairway to Heaven sound really close to each other (though the differences between those parts are still bigger than the differences between the Katy Perry melody and the Christian rap melody), but because they could find examples of other songs that sounded similar, the idea was too generic to be copyrightable.

I do think it's a fair argument to say that it's simply too generic a melody to be copyrightable, and I wouldn't disagree. Also, it is ridiculous if the Christian rap group now becomes the main songwriter of the song when in reality they just wrote that synth line - that's a really small part of the song, and not really even a part of the most important part of the song that is the vocal melody and lyrics. As Rick Beato said in his video, it would have been fair to give them like 10% of the song, but if they now basically own the song, that's ridiculous.

I'd just say switch up the sample a bit possibly by introducing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> here or there or you could pitch the sample up an octave at the end of a verse or chorus to give it some life. 

When making guitar beats it's important to think "how would someone play this live?" Keeping that in the back of your mind you'll always find dope ways to mess with the sample.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-03 03:35:02 Hanz_Brady<br>Of course man! And remember a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> doesn't even need to be a different melody. I often will play the base notes of my main chord progression with a lead synth or guitar to spread the sound out a bit and change the beat up. 

Most of my beats are usually the same 4 bar melody but layed with 5+ different sounds all playing different parts of the lead sound. 

A bit hard to explain but if you watch any of the Internet Money tutorials on YT you'd see they use the same method.

Light percussion can be very effective: I would say Timpani, Cymbal, Triangle might be enough.

As this song is a kind of homage to Kurenai: guitar intro to arrangements, it can be more dynamic in the arrangement like the one done by a chamber orchestra:  
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcOYaJkSG94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcOYaJkSG94) 

Additional <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and harmonies would be nice.

Mixing wise, it is a good balance except the main melody.  
Probably because of recording conditions, higher end frequencies are little muddy. Not much clarity. The main melody (sue vox), either piano or violin, is little weak. This part is the drive of the tune, so pushed forward and other parts can support the edge of the melody to create the feel of unity.

Hope this helps

The answer should have a pick up (B on beat 4). You should use the same <b><u>counter melody</u></b> (half note, quarter, quarter) introduce in bar 5 as when the 3rd voice enters. Means when the third voice enters, you are adding one accompaniment line along with two familiar themes, make sense? This is advice if you want to follow the rules of fugue.

The development is fun and creative. My biggest concern is that you lock into a heavy quarter note feel for a long time. I suggest exploring more rhythmic variation and sequences during your episodes. 

The ending felt abrupt. It’s common to end of the fugue with a statement of the theme. If you don’t want to do that, somehow you have to indicate to your listener that the piece is coming to a close (walk the melody down, or become rhythmically sparse).
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-04 10:44:21 death_threatz<br>Everything has nice hit to it thanks to the mixing which birthed this really clean. The variation is nice especially in that eastern groove of chords, I do think the melody gets played out after a certain point and a switch up or counter-melody could help keep interest.

I like your beat, the drums are dope and so is the melody too. I think you could of added a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> too and the beat could of had more bounce, it’s sounds a bit robotic at the moment.

I think you should add in another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> somewhere in the track just to make it a little less repetitive. I think you should also go for a slightly thumpier kick, the one your using here just is kinda lost in the mix.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-05 08:45:11 nvduhn<br>Gross Beat is useful for so much more than half time. The slow tripplett mode is dope af for cords, the arp modes can completely change a sample up and give you a totally faster or slower paced Melody allowing you to have a discernable verse and chorus without even coming up with your own <b><u>counter Melody</u></b>. So many neat features in it, especially for mastering, little reverses, cut offs, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>futurebeatproducers</b> 2019-08-05 11:58:10 b2ice<br>Those subtle melody changes tho! Beat is legendary as is, but if I had my way with it I’d probably add a little <b><u>counter melody</u></b> as a riser right before the beat drops. Good job bro!
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-08-05 17:30:01 BarneyColeman<br>Listen to me bro, first of all it depends on the beat, but if u got a simple melody, and wanna stick with just one melody, u gotta remove sum parts of the drums, like maybe at a first remove everything for like 8bars idk, and then start building em one by one, like for example, u remove everything, and then u put in the Snr and hi hats, and u go from there. But try to remove stuff and add stuff, to make it more interesting. It's crucial if u got a simple melody/sample, cuz else the beat gonna be Hella boring. Then on the chorus just put everything u got, it usually works for me.
If u got more than one melody like 3-4 u gotta be smart, and know where to put em, don't try to stack for melodies at once, sumtimes it might work, but it rarely does... Try to put like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on the hook,or maybe on the second part of the hook, to make it more interesting, then on the verse put another <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and then shortly after add another one... And try to switch sometimes from 808 to basslines, it makes the transition between chorus n verse, amazing...
But remember sum times arrange ain't that important, because listen to sum hits, they kinda repetitive, u feel me? Like drip too hard, bodak yellow, pissy pampers... But still, take this with a grain of salt, but at least try to have a pretty good arrangement, have a good day bro
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-08-06 05:21:22 Justbecauseweiner<br>It's all about arranging bro. For me, I make my main melody. I then make a 16 or 8 bar loop. I add as many things as I can to make it sound full. Layer a bunch of chords in the background, pads, I'll have a melody going and also a higher pitched <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to compliment the mid range melody. With the drums, I'll fill with as many hits and percs, just enough to make it sound like a full drum groove. At this point, everything should already sound like a full hook. I then arrange everything by working backwards. I'll either have my chords and melody playing to start things off in the intro, i'll use the drum groove i made but subtract some of the sounds, mostly keep the kick and clap, some of the percs, just to have a more unique drum groove. I'll make two parts of the verse, a more softer part with less instruments, second part i'll either introduce my bass or my hi hats, depending on how everything feels. All this will transition smoothly into my hook using build-ups, rolls or reverse crashes. And i'll make sure to have some background sounds or crashes to make my hook sound full, but sometimes i'll have a pre hook going probably with an added synth or a good bass melody that builds up into the hook. I'll decide after if my hook needs more or less. But don't think more sounds mean that it's a hook. Your hook can only have a melody and some harmony, little percussion. For me, it's always the percussion and drums that help distinguish my hooks. If you don't want to make your beats sound too looped, i always add a different melody on the hook or the same type of melody with a much harder synth or instrument. Sometimes my verses won't have a melody and only the harmony parts that support it. You can also try half-timing with Half-Time by Cable Guys, I've seen tons of producers do this to make it sound different.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-08-06 06:34:12 HiddenGentlemen<br>What style of music are you writing. A single voice with a bit of reverb and delay might cut it in some cases. 

When you want to layer there are many ways it can be done. Double the lead voice and have both centred with on quieter than the other. Triple them and pan left centre and right again have the main one louder.

With harmonies you might have a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that runs along side the lead to create interest or have many voices singing at once. These could basically be outlining the chords the whole way. 

One thing that helps it’s how you eq the voices. If you’re singing ever voice you could do with shaping them so your lead voice still pops. You might add some highs to the lead and take them out of the backings for example

yo this beat goes pretty hard, I like the sample a lot, and the pickup/drop of the percussion is really nice, I like how it starts a bit low key then progresses with that piano <b><u>counter melody</u></b> you got in there. Definitely a nice beat, I can't really point anything out that I don't like but I definitely wish that there was a bouncy 808 or more bass. I'm only listening on headphones but I only hear very little bounce, the bass that is there is nice and I do like the bounce in it, but  I feel like a good 808 pattern could have helped on one of the parts where a hook would go.

Appreciate the feedback bro!!!
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-08-06 09:16:13 Boh-dar<br>1. Bootsy Collins. There’s just nobody funkier imo. 

2. Holger Czukay. I fucking love Can and to me, his bass grooves *are* Can. Most of his bass lines are so simple yet so effective, and really form the backbone of their sound.

3. Paul McCartney. His sense of melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> are still unmatched.

Bonus 4. Aston Barrett. Greatest reggae bassist ever, his use of space proves that sometimes the notes you don’t play are just as important as the ones you do.
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-08-06 18:57:44 SuavoUK<br>Well I lost motivation for a month now and i usually do the same thing as others would say, to take a rest, but this time that hasn't been working for me. So I've been trying numerous things in this time and I have startd to realize a few things which I will share. 

Before I begin I was like you, prior to starting I had no knowledge of music at ALL. Not even 1%! No music theory no nothing! all that driven me to make music was the music I listened to. But starting off I didn't even know how to work with FL Studio, i decided to mess around FL studio making funny music just to see how each knobs work and work out the functionality of certain vsts. At the end of the day I was having fun making shit music because its the learning stages, we all make shit music first before we adjust and make good music. its like a tap if you install a new tap your going to have shit water come out and then clean water. Anyways Well I moved onto taking FLP's of the internet and learn about sound selection. I think sound selection is very important when it comes to making good music, you need right sounds to have all the instruments playing together sound nice. I also analyzed certain FLPs and found out how people write notes in the piano roll area in conjunction with the instruments they use. Pads are usually long, Pianos can be long or short depending on what your trying to achieve (Main melody, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>). Arpeggios are short, back to back notes that go up and down (great for giving  beat that fullness) and much more. 

Firstly one important thing for me was to just take a break from making music, but instead of just not doing music you should refresh your mind with new music, music you haven't heard of yet. Once you start listening to music more your brain will be telling you to add new elements into your music once you start creating after the break.

Secondly I think your stuck in a cycle of using the same instruments, VST, Mixing technique and whatnot. When you repeat something you master it but if you keep using it for too long you will become bored of it. So try incorporate new techniques into your music. It ties with the first point because your brain will know what new sounds you can use , but that will never happen if your always stuck listening to the same sounds you make all the time.

Thirdly I tried this before and it worked marvellously, after the break try give yourself a 365 beat challenge where you complete a beat a day, but the twist is that you create a beat within a new genre everyday. So for example you love creating trap right? First day create trap. Once you finished making it don't wait for the next day to start making the next genre ( e.g EDM). Start looking for tutorials to prepare yourself for the next days genre and so on. Once you become proactive you will start to see your skills improving and once the cycle comes back to trap you will have more skills than you have started off with. In-fact let me tell you this, the third day I made a UK rap beat  after making an EDM beat I had artists come to me to buy it off instantaneously! Not saying this will happen to you but the whole concept of making a beat a day for a year will help you because you set a goal for yourself to achieve and not just focusing on making one beat great. its an improvement overtime that gets you to making banger.

Thats all I have for now! However let me give you some links to the guys  helping every beat-maker out there.

I think the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> guitar is slightly "attack"-y. That could just be my personal preference. But you could play with a transient designer or just fading the audio so its a slightly softer attack. See how that sounds. Cool tune!
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-08-07 07:14:57 Mimori_Azume<br>Hey! I like the percussion in the background! I think it would be a lot more interesting if you added a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and switched things up a bit now and then, the first 30 seconds were nice, but music needs variety! It's a nice tune and would sound a lot better with some other melodies with it. Good luck!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-07 12:44:18 Definitely_Not_Brent<br>Be more confident about what you put out bro, you sound hella doubtful and saying it's shitty twice makes me not wanna listen to it.  I really like it, the sample is dope, bassline is super sick, and the drums sound super raw too.  It feels a bit too simple though, like it could benefit from one or two more sounds (hi hat, subtle pad or <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, etc).  I think adding maybe one or two more layers could make it more interesting across the run time.  Everything there, especially the chops, works really well already, keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-07 15:16:10 smittyjr95<br>"only" 3 presets isn't THAT simple i'd say, depends on the presets tho obviously and how they're used. I think the key is automations and solid arranging to make the beat dynamic. It helps to be w/ the artist to know how he/she is approaching the song so you know how to arrange it to it's full potential. 

There are easy ways to make the beat dynamic w/o even creating new patterns/counter melodies. For instance a trick I have is I export the melody out, and for a couple bars I will layer copy + paste the same melody, but make it unique, then eq out the highs and lows to make it sound filtered. then pitch it up 1200 cents (one full octave) and play around w/ some gross beat automations and it'll sound like it's own <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. You don't have to export the melody out to do this, you can just make the pattern unique but Fl Studio can do make the melody sound cool sometimes when you change the pitch of the sample versus doing it from the piano roll. Idk the exact mechanism behind this but it just happens
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-08-07 20:10:29 alaynmusic<br>I guess another way to look at it is what’s the captivating really emotional melody that you personally like, and consider that your hook/chorus, the parts before it should lead you too that whether it’s going from slow to fast or low to high. The way you lead it from verse to chorus is totally up to you to just keep messing around to see what builds the most tension + release. But again it doesn’t have to be that way either, we can see it in rap/pop nowadays with some of drakes songs that don’t really change much on the scale but change rhythmically. 

There’s no way to really tell whether the melody is gonna be better as an instrument <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or a vocal melody until you try it and then choose what you like, cause at the end of the day it’s going to be subjective to your preference anyways so just trust yourself and what you like and just test, trial and error.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-08 00:28:54 young_trip<br>i think the synth bass would be fine as a "<b><u>counter melody</u></b>" but thats up to you. this beat sounds cool but the snare sounds too low quality and its too loud. the snare roll is cool tho. the mix needs some work definitely. i think if you used that bass as <b><u>counter melody</u></b> it would be cool maybe only use it partially thru the track like on the chorus and towards the end of a verse.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-08-08 13:10:20 Brain_Glow<br>For years I purposefully avoided using common chord progressions in an attempt to be unique or original. And I made some ok songs. But I started to realize all the songs I really liked used those common mundane progressions, but it was the melody or an interesting counter-melody or some rhythmic device that made songs really good. So a couple years ago I began purposefully writing songs using common progressions and even the old cowboy chords and since then Ive been much happier with my songs and feel they are way better. Ive been forced to be creative with other elements of the song rather than trying to be cool by using non-traditional chord progressions.
</p></li><li><p><b>TheStorySoFar</b> 2019-08-09 01:58:15 Biffyclyro5727<br>I appreciate this. I feel for the most part it does use essentially root notes but I hear some <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Any thoughts on this?
</p></li><li><p><b>composertalk</b> 2019-08-09 15:46:29 crabapplesteam<br>There are so many ways, so what you'll have to do is find a strategy that works for you.

Some people hear entire melodies in their head - this I find is a very effective way of writing. You'll hear some fragment, and then keep working on it in your head until you write it down.

Another way is to take your fragment and find ways of developing it. Eventually, you'll want to learn as many ways of doing this as possible, and then stick to the ones you like best. You can repeat a phrase, but do it on a different pitch, in a different key, slowed down, sped, up, change the rhythm, put it upside down, add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, etc. Beethoven was the best at taking a small little idea and turning it into something much bigger.

Another way is to simply sit down at a piano (or guitar, or computer, or any other instrument) and keep trying things until you like it.

You'll also want to learn a bit about phrase structure, and how harmony effects how we perceive tension and release.

It's a long journey, so the best thing you can do is write as many things as you can and keep learning. Eventually you'd find what you like and what you don't like, and then get better at writing the things you like. When you start, you should look at pieces you like and try to imitate some of their techniques. You'll learn a lot that way.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-10 06:30:01 TheChosen1inc<br>I tried changing octaves, and reverb but it just sounds off. Like the loop is a .wav and whenever you try to add any keys or anything with it, it gets super loud. Then when you take the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> off it sounds way to low. Is there a way to make the sounds blend together more so they dont sound like they are on top of each other.
</p></li><li><p><b>LofiHipHop</b> 2019-08-10 15:00:08 Re_Drawne<br>I think that’s a pretty unique and cool sample (is it a sample or did you generate it yourself? I can’t tell, haha). I think for me, the reverb is a little too much and gets a little muddy with the 808s, but if you reduced the reverb or added in a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and lowered the sample volume it could lock in with the drums and 808’s a little better. Keep it up man!
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-08-11 16:27:30 2deeds<br>This is really something that you should develop instinctively, and not something meant to be followed like a rule. 

If you feel like you're unable to level well, then use reference tracks. At least then you can use tracks that are a similar style to yours so you can have an idea of the approximate level you'd like your sounds to be at. 

There's no point in us giving you numbers that are entirely dependent on the track and sample being used. It's not like even my own tracks follow the same levels, so you can't expect any numbers I give to be useful to you. 

I can tell you that I generally have my kick relatively loud, compared to my other sounds, while I usually have one melodic element around the same level as my 808, which are the next loudest elements, but generally a lot lower than the kick. Next comes the clap. The hi-hat is relatively low and around the same volume as my counter-melody and pad or other melodic elements. Then I got percs, cymbals, risers and other sounds as the lowest sounds and generally very quiet. 

It's also important to note that leveling isn't equivalent to sound perception. Lower frequencies are perceived as lower in volume, so while my kick and 808 are relatively loud compared to my other sounds, they're not necessarily *perceived* as being louder, or *that much* louder. 

And EQing also plays a massive role in loudness perception. If you do a drastic low pass on a kick, it can be very hard for it to cut through the mix, even if it's the loudest element in your track. Alternatively, doing a high pass on your melodies can make your kick cut through the mix, even if you raise the volume on your melodies to compensate for the frequency attenuation you just did.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-08-12 06:34:00 galaxy_boys<br>I'd slap on a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, a secondary snare, and some hihat rolls. The vibe is there already and some weird atmosphere noises would be sick
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-12 14:18:51 65TwinReverbRI<br>Here, I just made this little example to demonstrate it for you:

https://musescore.com/user/32723609/scores/5673395

A Melody is a single line of music, usually sung by or played on a single instrument by a person.

It is what most people sing when they "sing a song" or "hum a tune" and so on.

The first like of my example is marked "Melody" and that's the tail end of "Yankee Doodle".

Harmony is what is created when more than one note is played at a time. It forms what we call "chords". The second line marked "Harmony" is an example of some Chords - 3 note chords that form Harmony.

The third line shows these Chords being used as an Accompaniment to the Melody - marked as such. Together the Melody and the Chords are all part of the Harmony.

Harmony is everything that is sounding at once, while the Accompaniment is the element that "accompanies" the melody.

In the next line I made another Melody. This melody is slightly different than the first one in that it actually implies the harmony in that the notes are more the notes of the chords so we can almost hear more harmonic implications. It is not harmony itself, but it implies a possible harmony (so does the first melody but most of us know the tune and expect a certain harmony).

The next line combines the two melodies so they together form harmony, and are still both melodies (this is called Counterpoint) and one of the lines will be heard as "accompanying" the other - partly because it's lower and that is common, partly because the upper one is the familiar tune we know so we'll hear the other as "less important" in that way, and partly because it implies chords on its own and chords generally serve as accompaniments to melody.

Finally, I took the two melodies and put them together while taking the original chords and breaking them up into individual notes.

This is where things get a little tricky because all of the things together form Harmony, and chords, but there is a Melody, in counterpoint with another melody, or we sometimes call this a <b><u>Counter Melody</u></b>, and then the broken up chords sort of create their own melody line, though since they're more obviously broken up chords we'd probably consider them more "chords" or "harmony" and note a "melody" per se. And, the 2nd melody could be accompanying the first and the chords could be accompanying both - so music can get multiple layers like this. 

If you try to start with multi-layered textures like that, it will be harder to differentiate things because sometimes melodies can be accompanimental and form the harmony!

So better to start with something like the 3rd line, where there's a melody on top, accompaniment on the bottom, and then they both form harmony together, but the accompaniment is also it's own chords. We even call this kind of texture "Melody with Accompaniment" and just assume that the two together form harmony.

Hope that all helps.

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-08-13 03:27:18 racmuf<br>tbh, I would boost the lower part of, kinda mis the sub getting through. also a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would keep it going on a little bit better.

</p></li><li><p><b>FLStudioBeginners</b> 2019-08-13 16:40:04 hashmeet16<br>The beat is really nice but youve gotta make a <b><u>counter Melody</u></b> or else the normal Melody can get very repetitive. I suggest using flute

Other than that it's very nice
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-13 16:50:44 tPRoC<br>i'd try to add more texture and filtering to the main melody of the track here since it's so repetitive/omnipresent. rc-20 or izotope vinyl or something, maybe tame the highs just a little bit with an EQ. some sort of echo or flanger maybe to make it feel a little bit more ambient?

the little counter-melody that shows up every once in awhile could also be a tiny bit louder.

the drums are well mixed
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-13 17:25:30 im_whiteclaw<br>Hey so it's a really dope track man, it's not even my style of beat and you had me wanting to get on it. I definitely think you need a break from the main two chord line around the one minute mark. Before then it's repetitive but I think it'll be fine with vocals, but maybe around there you could switch to just the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and the drums or something, then bring the chords back in. I also think the mix on the bass could be cleaned up just a hair, it feels like it's occupying a bit too much space rn. But I'm also listening on bass heavy headphones rn so I could be wrong. 

Here's my track. Mostly just looking to see if people fuck with it or not, but definitely let me know if anything is wrong with it, cause there probably is something. https://soundcloud.com/whiteclawmusic/young-and-depressed/s-gfuo7
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-08-13 18:01:53 RyanTheArchitect<br>Sometimes I find it helpful to extract the midi information from melodies I find on splice. Then I can get a better idea of the chord progression (I have pretty much 0 music theory and play by ear, so it helps a lot), and then play around with the chords to either make a new melody or to make a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Just create what you think sounds good, and if it does, people won’t give a fuck how you made it. Keep grinding
</p></li><li><p><b>mathrock</b> 2019-08-14 12:03:48 jonasmurdock<br>Thanks so much!!! It's so sweet to hear such nice things about the TSOSIS stuff. Very excited to be working more on that project in the future.

There was definitely a bit of a learning curve. The biggest difference I can think of is that almost all of the AF parts are really "exposed" as in there's lots of single note melodies played with a completely crystal clear signal. There's nowhere to hide lol. Things that wouldn't even count as "mistakes" in a louder band start to sound more errant (not letting neighboring strings ring out is a big one)

Another big difference is that I tend to "chicken pick" things with a combination of using a pick plus finger picking, but with the AF parts everything is picked. I think I got a lot better with my picking accuracy learning and playing these parts. I realized I was using chicken picking as a crutch in situations where I should have just been getting the brightest tone possible by using my pick. 

My fav track off the new album is Heir Apparent. The flute + piano <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the verses is SO BEAUTIFUL
</p></li><li><p><b>radiohead</b> 2019-08-16 21:19:53 CitizenKal<br>It kinda sucks because it has the elements of a beautiful song, but overall just falters.

The opening motif with the legato strings and horn <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is haunting; Sam's vocal performance is beautiful and tinged with sadness; the verses are beautifully held back where they need to be; but the chorus is so bland and by-the-numbers that it genuinely ruins the rest of the song.

It is as if they tried really hard to mimic Radiohead without hiring the boys or using their song but just kind of failed.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-17 02:51:37 rkez<br>This was really nice, exactly what you’d expect from this kind of beat. The guitar was really nice, I loved the drums and just when I thought it might get repetitive you brought the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in during the second half. The only feedback point I have is in the second half with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and guitar at their full volumes there was some slight clashing in frequencies. These could maybe be mixed a bit better to allow for each part to have its own space in the mix. Really good beat overall though. 

If you want to check mine out, I’d appreciate any feedback.

I disagree with the other commenter i think the levels of the snare and percussion are fine but i think levels can be quite a subjective thing.

First of all, you need to turn up your hi hats, percs and snares in the mix man, theyre kinda getting lost behind the melody and 808 and you need to be able to hear them to give the track a bounce, especially the hats and snares. I also think that you could do with adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at some point in the track just to make it a little less repetitive. Thats all the critcism i have though man. Really love the sound selection and your melodies. Your 808 pattern is also fire. Just turn those drums up and this is a top beat. Nice stuff man!

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-08-19 09:29:22 candrayb<br>Hey I dig the vibes.

I think the side chain on the strings/pad can be turned down a bit so it blends a little better. 

The bass synth in the beginning can be turned up a bit it gets a little lost at times

The higher pitch synth sounds great especially with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in. You should definitely try having a break down to introduce the elements and bring them in a drop they they really impact the listener.

It sounds like there may be some harsh frequency’s in the snare that you can easily EQ out. 

Other than that it sounds good. Reminds me of an old Eric Prydz style track.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-19 13:09:18 thespinach56<br>i would add a little more on the melody maybe a couple extra sounds or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, it sounds a little dry. the drums also seem "a little in your face" but with a little bit of mixing, it will sound way better. i like the direction it's going

</p></li><li><p><b>touhou</b> 2019-08-21 22:41:35 Electrolls<br>I don't really have time for a full detailed impression but here's a summary from me

Stage 4 Theme : Love the call and response between the piano and guitar in the first melody section, epic bass pitch blend (well not really pitch blend, just fast bass notes which makes it sound like pitch blend), the modulation section sounds something from DDC? Magical Storm I think? REALLY LOVE THE CLIMAX (THE MELODY AND <b><u>COUNTER MELODY</u></b> IS SO ON POINT :ok\_hand: although its a bit jarring with both trumpet and guitar playing together) The guitar really brings out the power to this song :muscle:

Stage 4 Boss : Sounds like 6/4 to me, really throw me off when I listened to it first time. Really love the staccato lead rhythm, would totally make a bossa nova track with this song\~ Apparently this song spams a lot of that 4th &gt; #3 note chromatic motion (leading to a picardy third) which is something ZUN has been using lately in his song. Love the melody expansion near the end.

Stage 5 Theme : Err, really really good piano melody and bass rhythm, nothing else to talk about

Stage 5 Boss : Intro is very tension building and packed. Keeps looping around the same few bars a lot of time with the sp00ky chromatic chord progression which really reminds me of Koishi and Nue's theme. Really aggressive sounding melody, I think ZUN mixed some triplets along with his signature 3-3-2 rhythm into it, I can see myself learning this song on the piano just to MASH and HAVE FUN.

Stage 6 Theme :  [https://www.facebook.com/Touhouismo/videos/943354799344413/UzpfSTEwMDAwMDA1MTY1NzgzNDoyNzE0NDg0OTg4NTYzMTk2/](https://www.facebook.com/Touhouismo/videos/943354799344413/UzpfSTEwMDAwMDA1MTY1NzgzNDoyNzE0NDg0OTg4NTYzMTk2/) 

Stage 6 Boss : It's a nice song. Using that 3 notes motif all around the song (Not referring to Theme of Eastern Story) really makes the song simple and easy to digest. No idea why but this song really gives me that cozy warm Touhou feel to it, probably of the VI &gt; VII &gt; v &gt; i chord progression and the theme of eastern story? I guess ZUN did this song well as stage 6 boss by spamming the same melody all over again and slowly building up energy by adding more instrumentations and voicings. I still prefer my Stage 6 Theme to this though :eggplant:

Extra Stage Theme : Sounds like a typical stage theme, nothing to talk about. What really stands out from this song is the usage of acciaccaturas everywhere, dayum it's good af :thumbs\_up: A theme that is pretty decent but overshadowed by the other Touhou 17 Osts imo

Extra Stage Boss : Nice 1st melody section (ZUN has been using a lot of piano in the latter half of Touhou 17 songs, nani??!!?111??1) Love the chromatic melody section (I'm a sucker for chromatic sp00ky songs), chord progression is kinda similar to Magus Night. In the repeated loop of this song, ZUN added some harmonies above the melody which is pretty interesting.

tldr; nice
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-23 08:36:14 FathomSwank<br>Ayy man thanks for checking it out. Yea I need to cut the intro and add some stuff here and there its rlly still a work in progress. 

I love the melody on your joint. Sounds menacing and doesen't get boring. The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is crazy too. Can definitely see someone hop on this. One small thing is the kicks sound a tad bit flat to me. Could be my headphones tho but I think i would make the kicks hit a bit harder. The arrangement and mood of the track is super fire. Definitely just hit you with the like. Keep going bro
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-08-23 09:40:07 GratuitOfficial<br>The drop isnt very good but it doesn't seem like its also attempting to be a drop, it just feels like an intro which is fine. My problem is that the lead pluck isn't cute as a lead it's just down right annoying. You have several good melodies which are playing, but the good ones are in the background. The pluck feels more like a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-23 13:52:23 _KingOfSpades<br>That’s an interesting start, here’s my advice on how to improve it:

- Tune your 808 and try to add a bassline that follows the melody. Currently your 808 seems out of tune and plays the same note over and over- if you know what key the melody is in, make a simple 808 pattern using those notes. If you don’t, then just try different notes that sound good under the melody. You can lap incorporate 808 slides.
- Maybe add some percussion to spice up the drums. Some FX here and there will be good too.
- A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or some nice chords might add variation to keep the song interesting.

I hope that helps, keep it up!
Thoughts on mine? I just finished mixing it: https://soundcloud.com/kingofspadesbeats/hazy-lights-demo/s-4A3Lx
</p></li><li><p><b>MusicInTheMaking</b> 2019-08-23 22:25:21 TPNZ<br>I like what you have for now already. 

I'd have the melody that starts around 2:03 return in some kind of variation, with an added <b><u>counter melody</u></b> maybe?
</p></li><li><p><b>MusicInTheMaking</b> 2019-08-24 00:02:14 8004MikeJones<br>That idea sounds interesting.  Were you thinking more along the lines of Mozart counterpoint or Bach Fugue for <b><u>counter melody</u></b>?
</p></li><li><p><b>trance</b> 2019-08-24 05:24:48 S3baman<br>How can you mess something so easy as a tag man!

To be frank, I feared a lot worse than the final outcome. Most important thing is the melody, and that stays true to the original (albeit a couple of note changes I think) but I like <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and the breakbeat. The rolling baseline is updated, but it lost the big oomf I always got from the original (sounds more like a baseline Sean and Activa would do together). It's a hard remake/cover/rework/call it whatever for me to swallow because Drop is by far my favorite of the early tunes. I find Lift overplayed and overrated. It has a few small touches that I really like in which you can hear the modern Tyas sound (mainly the small effects here and there)
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-08-24 13:56:13 DizzyDaMan<br>Pros:
Melody is catchy, nice to listen to, not complex.
Hi Hat Pattern is unique



Cons:
Sound selection (drum wise) is very bad. Try to layer your sounds so they sound more "full"
Needs a layer on the main melody and/or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to go along it for easy transition between verse and chorus.
Bass/808 is just a NO from me. Use an actual 808 (spinz would work in this case)



What to improve/add:
Add some perc sounds 
Add an open hat
Add a crash after the drop
Make the kick pattern less boring
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-25 03:48:40 ITrustedTheProcess<br>Thanks. Really appreciate the mixing props, I'm translating from FL to Maschine, and mixing has been the toughest for me. Now my honest criticism of your project:

First off, the beat is dope. I love hearing violin/cello infused beats. Maybe some kind of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> somewhere in the beat would make it pop more...but again, that's all subjective and based on preference. As far as the flow, I think you're vocals are a little loud. I think your bars are okay, definitely room for improvement. I think a different cadence, tone, and delivery will do your flow good.

Instrumental: 7/10
Lyrics/Bars: 6/10
Cadence/Delivery (Yes this matters!): 5/10
</p></li><li><p><b>beats</b> 2019-08-25 08:27:20 dcstooksbury<br>I like it! I was listening on my phone and couldn’t hear the 808 very much so I’d add some distortion on it. Maybe add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> too during the verses
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-08-26 00:05:05 Psychological_Mind<br>Yeah pretty nice beat man. The 808s were fire. I would definitely mix up the melody a bit and add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> synth or something. Also some hi hat variation would be good.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-26 00:25:55 v_v_w_<br>&gt; heres mine

the melody that comes in at 1:20ish is dope.  the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> around 2:00 isn't really necessary imo but it still fits.  this is dope and i'd love to have 21 go back to his no heart days with some dark shit like this.
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-08-26 20:44:03 PrototypeDethMachine<br>But root 16ths being "what the song needs" is just your opinion though. Music is totally subjective, and one person's "this part needs root 16ths" is another person's "this part needs a counter-melody to spice it up". 

Maybe you're just not musically compatible? It happens.
</p></li><li><p><b>StarWars</b> 2019-08-26 23:52:42 king_bungus<br>i guess i could hear that, yeah. like as a counter-melody or something? they do sorta fit on top of each other. 
The other thing about Rey’s theme is that it has an otherworldly sadness to it—it’s not any sort of heroic fanfare. It’s pleasant and quaint on the surface, with the chimes and all, but the melody is a little mournful, with maybe a sense of solemn inevitability or foreboding.
WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN NEXT
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-08-27 01:05:31 GopherSaddle<br>I listened to this track a few times and I like it!  Track is full/has nice width, very relaxing/calming, and I like the melody.

percussion- I hear a kick, snare, open hat, closed hat, and a shaker. With five ingredients you can create so much variety.  Id be curious what other beat patterns you could create and how youd match them to different stages of the song.  I often like to bus all of these together as well; when you bus them you can try weird stuff like a delay, reverb or/and filter for transitions.    

bassline-  my basslines always guide my songs/ i write them first.  Right now I hear a 4/4 pattern that stays at C.  Id be curious how things would progress if you went to D/F at 0:36.  This might add more variety or completely wreck the song- never know until one tries :]

Leads- your lead pluck sounds awesome.  Something I like to do is copy paste the melody into another lead that hosts a similar frequency range.  I will always find another layer or develop a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> from it.

Love this track and thank you so much for sharing it!
</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2019-08-27 17:24:16 yoursilentface586<br>Generally speaking, in a pop song the melody will be the notes that the singer is singing. The repeated piano part is more of an accompaniment or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the vocal line.

Make a midi progression that is a chord progression with a melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> running over it. Turn this into a sampleand reverse it, then chop it up and switch them around. Makes cool shit.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-08-28 21:23:06 JKBeats_<br>The melody is nice man I like it. I think overall the beat sounds a bit dry, I think maybe because there is not enough bass. Take that as you may, I am listening on my iMac speakers currently so might be missing something. Did you use 808s are just a kick? I think this could benefit a lot from some sounds in the lower frequency range or maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to switch things up.

Definitely got potential man keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-08-28 22:31:33 FunctionalGopher<br>The real advantage of ghost notes is that it's a tremendous aid in developing melodies and counter melodies because you get to see the notes and note lengths that were played on other instruments.  


Ghost notes with scale highlighting in FL Studio is really a melody/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> and rhythm hack.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2019-08-28 23:26:10 Kingviper289<br>It's also called polyphony or counter-melody when two melodic lines play at the same time. The rest can also notify you when a different voice is out and about somewhere and you should look out for it, especially when sightreading

And some effects and transitions sounds for drops and stuff
</p></li><li><p><b>DaveChappelle</b> 2019-08-31 06:15:29 crumbypockets<br>I keep racking my brain wondering why he opens the show with him singing "Party like it's 1999" and talking about Anthony Bourdain's suicide. It's the only part of the special that doesn't deal with a social issue. It deals with the personal issue of suicide. And why does he start singing the song without any transition between it and the joke? It just seems so oddly placed to me and to fuckin' open with it...i just don't know what to think. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm inclined to believe a lot of things that we are told to be true are actually false. One of those things being Bourdain's suicide. It seems fishy to me, especially since he and Asia Argento (who also got smeared) were going after the hollywood elite right before he died. How he said he wouldn't commit suicide because his daughter. It just doesn't seem like a legitimate suicide. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chappelle even says that Bourdain had the greatest life anyone could imagine, and that the dude who fucked up his law school career by marrying a girl he would divorce and now works at footlocker hasn't killed himself, but Bourdain has? 

&amp;#x200B;

Especially considering his Bird Revelation special. That whole special was a metaphor for how hollywood works and what he went through being successful. Charlie Parker's nickname was Bird. He had a style of playing saxophone where we would imply the melody of a song by playing the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. If Chappelle is applying this revelation to comedy, he can say what he wants to say without coming out and saying it, just implying it.

&amp;#x200B;

After that joke, he goes into all of the "culture war" bits that are garnering all the headlines. But, it's all just words. We're all caught up in the words and offending people that by the end of the special we forget about his joke about Bourdain killing himself because we're thinking about all the shit he said about the LGBT and guns and Jussie Smollett. We're not thinking about the elite's plot to murder those who dare speak out against them like Bourdain did. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then singing Party like it's 1999? Maybe to signify that even though the world is going to shit, he's still here to have a good time and we all should be doing the same thing?

</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-09-01 00:48:57 ChrisMill5<br>It's all about balance. I can play all up and down the fretboard, melody, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, solos, funky syncopated 16th notes, whatever comes to me at the moment - but that's not always, or even often, what sounds best.

Being able to play like that is fine and dandy for your solo YouTube channel, or if you build your band around your bass playing. But even as a fellow bassist, that bores me to death. The bass has a role to play, just like the drums and vocals and whatever treble instruments are in the band. The way you're describing "bitter traditional players" makes me think that they know a lot more about how to do their job as a bassist than you do.

When I was 24 I probably thought the same way you do, but spend some time with a competent band leader and you'll learn an awful lot more about your role as a bassist than being in bands with your friends and playing a handful of shows.

If you live in the states you've only had three years in which to do professional gigging, which is great! But don't discount someone who's been around for ten times as long just because y'all don't agree. I've been gigging for ten years and I only went full time two years ago, I'm still learning from the older dudes in the scene all the time.

If you're still working on it, throw in more variation to the background beats/instrumentation and maybe some rise and falls to lead in and out of the choruses. Maybe double track vocals on the chorus or add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Also I like the outro crash sounds effects but they are are mixed a bit high.

Utter hogwash. 

&gt; there is no point in doing something without an idea behind it

Absolute truth.

99% of techno and 100% of good techno requires precise timing, counting and a good idea.

I usually work in reverse. Make a 1  bar loop in 4/4 time at 120 bpm. Layer up kick, hat, shaker, snare, claps, a killer bass sound and one synth part with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for the bass. Spend a lot of time tweaking your VST synth to get a unique sounding baseline, very critical.

Now copy it out to 4 bars and add some variety to bars 3 and 4. Add a fill to the drums and a ride or fall in the bass. Which notes? The circle of fifths is your friend here.

Once you have 4 bars sounding decent, start arranging by moving your current 4 bars out to say, bar 65, and double it to an 8 bar loop that repeats twice. This is your chorus or hook.

Now copy those 8 bars “to the left” towards bar 1 and remove or mute parts as you get nearer to bar 1. Now you have an intro that builds to the chorus. 

At least 65% of techno has this structure.

The rest is mixing automation and effects. Delay at 3/8 sync is your friend. Tiny amount of reverb except on one pad or arp to give it a spacey feel.

After your 8 bar chorus, copy it “to the right” twice for 16 bars of “break” and drop out the kick and snare or all but the hat &amp; shaker for 4 bars, then bring back in some stuff for 4 and finally back to all parts by bringing in the kick and snare again.

When you drop out all the drums, add a pad with some noise sweep and reverb. After that, experiment with variations of the parts by mutiny different tracks. 

This overall concept is the general idea for many electronic genres including techno, house, progressive and trance. Some psytrance is very similar but uses 6/8 time.

Hope this helps!

Agree.

Disagree. While there is a time and place for <b><u>counter melody</u></b> there's more often a place to lock into a drum groove and provide a solid foundation. Playing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at the wrong time is unproductive noodling at best, destructive to the song at worst.

To try and keep the 808 sound even on crappy phones and shit earphones try to EQ up until the Mid balancing everything else. 

I detuned the melodies and maybe I did that too much that's why they sound off(I'll try to keep that in mind).

Any suggestions for the 808 and how to mix it keep a solid sound? 

Melodies, I believe they're called mallets and they're great, both melody and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> but they kinda feel empty maybe try adding pads and copy the patterns.

Variation is key to keep the listener interested! That could be done by putting a different melody into the beat or even a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to play alongside the main melody!

I see a lot of these beats come through similar to this but the main difference between this and those other ones is the tones of each instrument. Drums are perfect, instantly knew what you were going for but mainly the Gutair sounds unique, earworm-ish and let's Gunna or Thug croon over it. Big Props you have a better ear than a normal person making "type beats"
One take away I have, I really wish you added more instruments! Maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the Gutair or some strings as accent notes, whatever! It spices up at 16 bar refrain a lot and rewards the listener. That's all I got for ya.
Just made this, Im a boom bap producer primarily so I'd love to hear your thoughts. This one was a bit more experimental.

</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2019-09-08 23:36:06 magsdos<br>I don't necessarily agree with Professor Roger Parker's assessment of why quartets are not balanced. Firstly, the first violin almost always projects the best and sounds loudest in a string quartet, a function of the octave they are playing in as well as the physics of the instrument being perfectly suited to project the register. The second violin comes through reasonably well for the same reasons and the cello projects due to its size (which is proportional to the octave it plays in) and resultant resonance. The viola actually projects the least due to the octave it plays in being less than ideal for the proportions of the instrument and this hinders resonance and projection. This creates a hierarchy of first violin (melody), second violin (harmony/counter-melody), cello (bass line), and viola (bass-line, harmony, sometimes counter-melody).

As for the issue of intonation in relation to size of the instrument I just think it is pointless to bring up. It is hard to play in tune on any string instrument, full stop. The composer writes what they want and the performer will do their best to play it. For example, Beethoven wrote parts that were notoriously difficult and was not always able to obtain players that could play them for premieres. The skill of musicians is always on the rise and composers know this, Mozart wrote a piano concerto that his father said was unplayable and Mozart said that's what made it fun, it is now a piece that 12-year-old pianists learn. It is true that Haydn and Mozart's string quartets can treat the cello and viola as glorified basso continuo and this changed throughout the late classical and romantic eras. I would also like to point out that those early quartets can be extremely difficult to play due to the simplistic exposed parts (more my opinion than anything else).

I think the issue with sting quartets stems from the similarity in timbre (relatively) of the four instruments. One would be hard pressed to find a grouping of four outside of a barbershop quartet and maybe a brass quartet that can blend their sound so effectively and, at the highest level, sound like one instrument. Perhaps the issue for OP is the timbres can be so similar and exposed, there is none of the blending of a string orchestra and none of the contrast of say a sonata or a symphony.  (Personally Piano+strings chamber music is my favorite because of this)

The only thing I could suggest is to listen to high quality recordings of great quartets. Emerson, Amadeus, Budapest, Pro Arte, Alban Berg, Guarneri, and Takacs are all highly acclaimed. For more recent adventure consider Turtle Island and Aizuri quartets. I hope this offers some insight and happy listening.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-09-10 16:24:59 ItsYungBeethoven<br>Hey! Thanks for your feedback!

I do like your beat, but here are some things i would suggest you: first of all the open hat does stand out too much, idk, its either too bright or too loud. try to tweak that a bit! Furthermore parts like 0.35  feel a bit empty! Try to put some ambient sounds into the beat so it feels like one piece of music! Lastly it feels like the beat structure is done, but somewhat is missing. Imo you should add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> which leads the whole beat. Right now it sounds like something you would play in the background and not pay really attention to. But with another instrument, maybe even a saxophone, you would create some tension, some energy, which would help lead the song a lot!
But dont get me wrong, i do think the beat is good, it just needs some tweaking here and there!

Your piano <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is vibey and whatever effect you're putting on it resonates in this subconscious part of my brain. talk about inducing nostalgia. I dig that bed creaking effect (though after a few listens I started to notice it too much.)  I dig what it transitions into around :40 and 1:14, more of that would be a nice change.

For example, musicals are an excellent source of musical pieces that have multiple melodies that play simultaneously. Key &amp; Peele [satirized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__d2FMCtgi4) how musicals like to do this a lot with the human voice, but this [duet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zygTvmzlBp4) from the musical *Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street* exemplifies this technique more seriously.

Secondly, making sure that the tonal instruments that are voicing their motifs with each other are all in the same key unless you are consciously making the decision to intentionally break this rule for creative/artistic purposes. 

Thirdly, experimentation, trial and error, and trusting your ears are solid, well-established practices. I would think seasoned instrumentalists have a particular leg up when doing this with melody, but that certainly should not and has not stopped those who aren't skilled in that regard.

From what I can tell in the song that you are referencing in your post, it sounds like the artist is either layering the tinkly instrument with a glidier synth sound with small variations to the melody or using some type of canon where you voice the same melody with itself (and a different instrument if the composer chooses), but at a different time. The song *Row, Row, Row Your Boat* is probably the most well-known example of this compositional technique.

The idea behind multiple melodies voicing at once in a graceful and musical way is not new. The old school term is called "[counterpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint)" and it could be of some interest to you if you would like to study the theory behind this compositional technique. 

As far as tips for implementation:

* Think contrast.
* **Contrasting Melodic Shape:** as one melody behaves in one way, have the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> playing in another way. For example, if one melody is expressing a certain idea by moving up the scale and then down, the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> can express an opposing idea by moving down the scale and then up. It's up to taste as to how mirrored you would make the different melodies.
* **Contrasting Melodic Rhythm:** in the example above, if you were to create exact mirrors of the melody, it would really just be interval voicings with wide/narrow ranges between the notes that are playing simultaneously. Our ears hear chords when notes play at the same time, so to make effective counter melodies, their shape needs to differ not just vertically, as mentioned in the tip above, but horizontally as well. The rhythm of two or more different melodies playing at the same time needs to be different or else we would just hear them as layers to the main melody rather than the independent harmonies that we want them to be. 
* **Contrasting Frequency Ranges:** allow each instrument that is playing its own melody to sit in its own frequency range. The most straight forward example of multiple melodies playing together harmoniously is having a bassline, a chord progression, and a lead melody. Keep in mind that as you go down the frequency range, it's recommended that you keep your melodic movement simple and you increase busyness as you go upward. This is why arpeggios are often voiced with high-frequency notes and basslines are often very basic. 

I hope this helps.

just keep trying and dont give up. no one can learn something in a day practice is how youll get there. i do know that a common tactic for alot of artists is to write to a beat before leasing/buying, no shade but maybe next time try writing your song before commiting to a specific beat. i hope youre able to finish your projects!

The quiet ostinato in the beginning isn’t that weird, however it does use the tritone, which isn’t creepy in itself but it does weaken the established tonality a little. Then the melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> blast into the piece. The melody also does that weird thing where in never really lands on the note it’s trying to play. Both voices are dissonant with each other and the melody never actually feels resolved. The ear has no tonal center to hold onto and so the whole piece sounds like it’s stuck in this weird place. It builds a lot of tension because we want to hear those dissonances resolved and we want to hear anything that resembles a I chord but we never do. We’re left to sit in this cyclical state of unrest. We are uncomfortable and no matter how long we search for release we’ll never find it.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-09-14 14:37:37 charlesdl123<br>I like it the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> caught me off guard though
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-09-14 19:59:31 8549176320<br>Beautiful pad, nice progression. The snare is annoying, and it needs a distant soft distorted, echoed guitar in there playing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. But then again, I'm a guitarist and I'm old, so don't listen to me.
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-09-15 09:19:12 Rdewd514<br>I would agree with the sentiment that everyone is different.  Also, everyone learned their process differently.  For me personally making a quick 8 bar melody then laying down percussion, then a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is perfect.  But I've see all sorts of creative processes, I personally don't always follow my own process just to see what I can make.  This process is just to get something done.  


Some people even write their lyrics before anything, I personally do not due to a friend of mine awhile ago saying this to me when I asked about their creative process.    


"If you write out your lyrics and vocal melody before writing out your actual instrumental it can cause you to work in too small of a box when it comes to creating the beat.  I always create my beat before anything else, because for me it's easier to allow myself to embrace changes during the creative process."  


This statement isn't game changing but for me has stuck and has proved to work better for my process.  :)

The white noise all sounds a little hot in the mix but thats an easy fix. The kick could also punch a little bit more, maybe try layering a thumpier kick with a punchy transient? Good looks bro!

I feel like it is lacking something or it is not enough happening to keep it interesting but that might not be the case if some artist hopped on it. I think you should look into switching it up a little or adding <b><u>counter melody</u></b> maybe.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-09-17 03:37:52 garrymo<br>It actually isn’t a sample, just a few layered sounds on top of eachother, but I take that as a compliment! For yours, I really liked the sequencing, and the piano <b><u>counter melody</u></b> sounded really good with the reverb on it around the 2:40 mark. The main negative is I’d say the drums sounded a bit “stiff” if that makes any sense. Maybe another kit would be better, as I’ve found some pretty decent boom bap kits on r/drumkits. Also maybe a few effects on the different melodies because they sounded a bit “stock” at times sound it might give them some personality. But overall, good structure and patterns, and thanks for the feedback!
</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriting</b> 2019-09-18 02:26:16 rinse_2<br>What if the first 4 bars didn't include the bass line? Might sound a little more dramatic when both the vocals and the bass came in together.  

Really like the harmonies in the chorus; but the chorus could use a little more differentiation -- what if you added a simple, high counter-melody of some kind in the background? Just a few ringing high notes would do, using a different guitar sound, maybe with reverb. 

The ending is really abrupt. 

Your voice is outstanding and the melody / lyrics are also outstanding. Good main guitar lick too.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-18 09:32:49 south87<br>Good work, I see a good amount of creativity and intuition. Overall, what is lacking is compositional technique. What does that mean? That you cannot see yet the complete potential in your music. Maybe you do but you cant fully write it out yet, mainly because you dont know all the paths you could take. I see great stuff here.

The first piece could benefit from textural changes involving all instruments in terms of register. For starters, all the melodies occur in unison. Try moving that around. Also, the Piano is too static. The progression and rhythm is ok but you could keep the steady beat while adding registral variation. Also, its ok if the Piano doesnt help with the melody all the time, give it something else to do with the right hand. 

In composition, you can't repeat yourself. Basically keep your structure and the first 13 bars, they work fine as they are. For the remaining bars, change the interval relation between the wind instruments and change the accompaniment a bit with each section. 

I think it could benefit if you make a return to the first theme. The material just before the end deserves to have its own section, its interesting. Why not make the piece an ABA?

The second piece: don't use literal repetition! Write out the whole thing again but with registral variations, maybe add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, maybe change a few chords, make it go somewhere else!

Thats my take on the first 2. You have some good material, check some composition resources in the sidebar so you can improve your technique.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-09-19 00:55:36 astensean<br>I like the reverb on the snare. The drums :15-:40 are repetitive and the arrangement is very basic imo. I "get it" when the bass and hihats come in at :49. That shit slaps. I like your use of the bass as a counter-melody. Maybe could just use some ambient sounds and some more arrangement, but otherwise it sounds great to me man.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-09-19 03:30:35 NinjaruCatu<br>What genre? For trance I like to use a send track on the lead or arp and throw a long reverb on and then side chain just the reverb with either the kick, or the instrument itself,  it creates a nice pulsing pad effect. You can stereo separate it as well and play with the volume so it sits nicely in the background.

Or you could fill space with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, sometimes that goes a long way.
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-09-19 10:59:31 ChrispyFry<br>This is actually pretty dope.

</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-09-20 17:00:02 prodbykeyvalue<br>Drums sound great but they run the same too long. I would say the same for the chorus.

</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-09-20 23:30:56 lilzimm48<br>To me, it does sound a bit repetitive. What i would always do when making such beats would be to try to change up the melody at some parts, or add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. You could also try exporting the melody that you have (if it isn't a loop already) and half timing it to create a sorta breakdown section in the beat. Otherwise pretty good!
</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-09-20 23:35:39 lilzimm48<br>I am also looking to add vocals, but have no thoughts for a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, thanks!

Overall the mixing is decent and I was able to distinguish most of the various parts even on my shitty earphones so well done there. 

As I mentioned the only thing you should work on the beat is the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> ...so technically take your time with the sound selection process.

I really hope this will help you improve...keep it up 💯 and never stop man!

</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-09-24 04:57:43 Enkamusic<br>The piano feels like its proper far back in the mix? Not sure if that was the intention but it's kinda weird for me to hear the melody being so over powered by the 808 especially when the 808 isn't hitting super often.

The piano melody is nice but needs <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or an abrasive atmosphere to fill the space the piano doesn't take.

The majority of the percs seem to come from the left which leaves the middle with mainly hi hats and the right feels lacking. A piece like this you could go wild with the patterns and have something really engaging.

It's a good base to have and could turn to be a proper dope track but it does feel like a base at the moment man.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to hear your thoughts on my track!  [https://soundcloud.com/enka\_tl/still](https://soundcloud.com/enka_tl/still)
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-09-24 09:23:16 mothaho94<br>Yeah thanks for that man. Agreed, <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would work well. Melodies are great on your beat, might be worth adding a couple more percs and/or hat rolls to make the drums abit more interesting. Overall good work though!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-24 21:45:53 The_Angel_Of_Def<br>&gt;If you actually had questions or cared to discuss this in any actual way, you would have posted this in the jazz subreddit. But this is something else.

It*is* something else. It's a clarification of tritone subs on a subreddit that discusses them often and misunderstands them almost as often. The rhetorical nature of my title must have confused you.

&gt;It's weird that you think it would be different. No matter how many instruments you break it up between, it will sound fully diminished.

Same reason I think that you can hear a melody, a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and a bassline separately even if they're harmonically derived from the same chord. The chromatic movement of Dm7-Db7-CM7 is very distinct and the riffs and voice leading derived from it reflect that. 

Db7/G7 also wouldn't sound fully diminished even as a compound chord played by a single instrument. It has a major third and a minor seventh in it. The additional notes from Db7 are just the b9 and #11 of G7. It's still just a dominant chord but with extensions.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-09-25 00:54:49 vin-2000<br>Clean mix, <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is dope and the beat stays interesting throughout. Nice work, keep it up.
</p></li><li><p><b>banddirector</b> 2019-09-25 05:25:27 the_sylince<br>Take the keys of the piece and long tome it out throughout these pitches, you may alternatively have brass buzz while woodwinds play. 

Isolate the primary rhythmic figures and count, play these in various degrees of said keys. Do the same with articulated passages.

Isolate the primary melody, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and distribute to band to rehearse together (almost like a method book line)

Take the 1st and 3rd beat of each measure and map out a harmonic analysis and distribute as a chorale, include any important suspensions/anticipations/nonchordal tones 

Go from long tones to rhythms. Rhythms to articulations. Articulations to technique within the keys(scales). Technique to melodic work, melodic work to chorale for intonation and balance. Work your selected section of the piece. Do not just “run the work”. Rather, isolate specific sections of the music and build from the tubas up.

Utilize your percussion by isolating difficult rhythms to be repeated in the long tones or reinforcing required rudiments.

Hope this helps!

They couldn’t care less you even exist. Most people want to hear something familiar because it’s easier to engage with what is familiar instead of what is foreign. If you want to book performances beyond the first handful of friends and family gigs, you need to be able to perform cover songs. LOTS of cover songs. Google Billboard’s historical, yearly Top 10 hits, starting from today going back to 1960. Learn as many of them as you can. Learn to impersonate them as close to the recorded sound as you can. Do nothing but this for your first year. 

Set aside as much time as you can every day to *practice*—not play or write—your instrument and singing. This includes learning as many of the yearly Top 10s as you can but also Scale and Chord training. So if you have two hours every day you can devote to practicing and learning split those two hours into thirds. That’s 40 minutes for warming-up/training Scales, 40 minutes practicing historical Top 10s, 40 minutes practicing current Top 10s. 

ALWAYS use a metronome.

If your school (or nearby schools, or churches) offer any music classes—be it playing or theory—GO TO THEM. If none are offered near you, take them online. 

After your first year you can start to move away from doing only impersonation-style covers and into *interpretation*-style covers. This is where you will start to better understand *your* style of playing/and performing. If you’ve kept up with the theory classes over the interim year, then you should have enough command over transposing chords, counter-melody, and vocal harmonizing to be able to deconstruct some of the covers you’ve learned to impersonate and re-work them with a fresh, engaging twist that leaves *just* enough of the song’s core to be familiar to people who know the original, but leaves you ample room to put your own, emerging style into it.

By the end of year 2 into 3, you will legally be an adult if you live in America. Move to LA or NYC . Yes, other cities have *scenes* but you said you want to make a career out of songwriting. Only NYC have the top-shelf major music and entertainment business infrastructure for Pop music. If you want to do Country, obviously you have to go to Nashville. If you’re outside of America, research which major city in your country has the strongest ties to the music and entertainment business. Move there. Play everywhere you can, as often as you can, with as many different people and in front of as many different crowds as you can. Because unless and until a super-agent, manager, or scout offers to represent you for free you’re not just a songwriter/performer. YOU ARE YOUR AGENT/MARKETER/NETWORKER. 

So you make it in the big city of your choosing and are now into year 4. You’ve made lots of great contacts, maybe been to sit in with a few assembly line professional songwriting sessions. You were even able to get a part-time job at a pro-studio. Sure, you’re mostly a glorified gopher, but a few engineers have taken a liking to you and throwing you free recording/producing information along with a little bit of time to record some demos better than what you can do with your limited budget and cramped, untreated bedroom setup. 

Your head is a non-stop jukebox playing all the versions of your burgeoning new songs you to record. You write constantly. You’ve made further than even your most ardent hometown supporters thought you could. You’re able to get top-notch studio players from your circle of friends and contacts you’ve made. The “right” people are starting to hear your name more and more often. But they soon will, because now is the time to pour out every last drop of individuality and uniqueness about YOU, YOUR playing, YOUR singing, and YOUR songs that you’ve been nurturing inside of yourself while honing the *trade* and *craft* of being a professional songwriter. 

The sessions are fantastic. You’ve been signed to a major talent agency. They’re throwing a drop-date party to promote your first, original LP. The party is packed. Everyone there is awe of your talent and skill. The songs drop the next day. Within a week you’re over 100 million plays/views between the major online outlets.

You get he first royalty notification email from your Performance Rights .org. You open the email up, sterling yourself to finally realize the material reward you so richly deserve.

Sounds like some shit out of an under armour commercial or something lol. Only thing is I’d suggest not using the same note for all your samples. The only thing that had a melody was the chanting sample. Some different notes for the other samples could make a nice <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to it. But this is tough man.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-27 03:59:48 Beastintheomlet<br>Basslines are really the defining aspect that says what a chord is. 

For example, if you're playing a C major chord of a C in the bass you have a C major chord. But if you play an A in the bass under a C major chord it's not C major anymore, it's Am7. You can completely reharmonize a chord progression with the bass alone, it's what makes it so powerful in composing. 

Rhythm is also really important, a stagnant bassline that just follows a chord progression will sound bland. In rock music it's common to sync the bass with the kick drum to give it more of a locked in feeling. In jazz the bass will walk, meaning playing a moving bassline that arpegiates the chord, or leads into the next chord. It's also common for the bass to be a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-27 04:05:21 s-multicellular<br>&gt; if I have a chord progression in key of C major I should be able to create a bassline using the notes C D E F G A B C? 

Yes, that generally should work. 

More specifically, I'd say, timbre/frequency spectral spread being in normal ranges:

* if you have a chord playing, the root of that chord should work. 
* A 5th up from the root or 4th down from the root will usually work with a bit of a more nuanced sound, can sometimes makes things feel like an inversion (arguably becomes an inversion but that's just notation v psycho-harmonics imho)
* the third of the chord in the bass causes some sense of tension. Are we at a point of not sounding good? I don't know, you see these sometimes and I don't think they wildly jump out at you. 
* Anything else is a definite tension and really becomes a more *aligned* notation/psycho-harmonic question as to what the chord is. However, a lot of bass parts start on the root or 5th/4th and having 'passing' or 'walking' notes that hit others and those short-lived tensions can provide a lot of glue, movement, or even a counter-melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-09-27 05:10:06 MuzBizGuy<br>Well, I'd imagine composition teachers assume you already know how to play at least some instrument and have a solid grasp of music theory, otherwise it will be hard to really teach you much. Orchestral composition is a fairly advanced skill.

That being said, to extremely over-simplify things, the heart of composing, especially orchestral music, is understanding chord voicings and harmony. Contextually, that means you should have a solid grasp of instruments' ranges, the timbre of brass vs strings vs woodwinds, and specially in those families, as well, ie a flute vs an oboe. You don't need to go out and learn how to play the french horn or whatever, though, you can get a good grasp of timbre just by listening to/watching a ton of other music, but understanding all that will help you get the sounds/ideas out of your head.

So the reason learning piano is the best thing you can do is because it's a polyphonic instrument that has a clean timbre, so you can get a good sense of chords/chord progressions' general feel/sound before specifically thinking where you want melody, harmony, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, etc.

Learning music theory in tandem with piano is a good idea too, and much of it is innately connected anyway, because it'll give you the tools necessary to communicate your music well. Also, just something I like to tell people (and have gotten into many an argument about this) but music theory is NOT a set of rules. All it is is ways to communicate/describe the music you're making. And I say this because when you're learning these things, don't think there are any restrictions of what you can/can't do. If you want to write a song in C Major, that doesn't mean you're restricted to notes/chords in C Major. Literally anything you do to fuck with chords/scales/etc can be described simply and/or conceptually with music theory.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-09-27 09:24:31 York_East<br>So first off I like your melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> going on here. Other than that id say for one thing is to mess with the melodies a little more so they have character throughout. Maybe pitch one down in a certain area, for an idea. Also that flute was spot on when it hit. That was a great addition as well. I also like the groove you have with the drums. Imo  you got a good beat here my guy. The only thing I noticed was that it can be a little repetitive after awhile. Like if this was intended for someone to rap on you need to take some elements and give the artist enough freedom to do what they have to do while finding that balance of "flexing" your producer muscles ya know? heres mine lemme know what you think!  
One beat of many upcoming new tracks. If you have feedback I 100% want to hear it! This beat is a pre-master so things will be a lil more balanced once finished, but let me know how you feel about the beat, and what you think works well with it! Thanks my guy!

&amp;#x200B;

here's mine: [https://soundcloud.com/gvuhn/shecouldnthandlethe16](https://soundcloud.com/gvuhn/shecouldnthandlethe16) . I just started producing a months ago and I'd like to know how I went on my first 'actual' beat.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-09-28 19:54:47 gvuhn<br>Thanks! Yeah I admit getting a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> was hard because I'm still not good with the keys but I'll deffo try to change it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-09-28 21:34:37 gvuhn<br>thanks for the honest reply! idk if it's the type of music im into, but i really like 808s and tuning them for my own liking, imo gives it more life than the generic 808s that comes from any sample pack. I'll definitely take this into account though.

&amp;#x200B;

As for your music, pretty sweet. I like the hard hitting bass and the distorted vocals along with it. Could be improved maybe if there's a bit of variation in the drums and I can tell there's a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the middle but the drums make it heard. Anyway, everything else is sick, good job!
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-09-28 22:30:27 dariotribulo<br>the 808s sound great and the drums too. but the melody gets a little bit boring after a while... maybe try adding some other <b><u>counter melody</u></b>
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-09-28 23:46:28 Hiland4<br>It sounds well mixed. The melody becomes a bit droning after a bit. But a different chop line for a segment or two. Or add another element like a pad or keys to create some sort of <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Grind on.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-09-29 04:03:42 veryyoungandhandsome<br>Don't sugarcoat?  Well okay:

This beat is super garbage and generic, you should quit making music right now and you'll never find true love.

Okay just kidding.

This reminds me a bit of the Shotta Flow series.  This is one of those catchy + but simple beats that could really go to the next level if you layered the melody or added a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>!  I like the unconventional 808, cool choice there, I'd try layering a kick on it to see how that sounds?  It could help cut through on the mix and just add a little more oomph.  Keep it up, this is good shtuff.

Here's my track:

[https://youtu.be/XQqL6ID4xWI](https://youtu.be/XQqL6ID4xWI)
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-09-29 14:48:43 ChrispyFry<br>I listened to the first one. Will probably listen to the rest, But I will be roasting the first one only. First off, I thought the track was pretty cool and I liked the bass guitar a lot. The lead vocals weren't bad, you have an interesting voice, I think the higher pitched vocals would sound cooler if they were a bit more wet and wider, even automate it, anything to get variation going. I wished you would've slowly built the energy by adding more percussion and perhaps a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. For some reason I hear triplet note floor toms starting soft in the beginning of each measure and getting louder, then soft to loud again on the next measure, then again and again, you feel me? Coming in on the 1 and hitting 12 times. Also a crash or two wouldn't hurt. All in all was an enjoyable listen, but got a little boring, you should add an element or two after each transition/riser. Tambourine could also sound cool. Keep at it man!
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-09-29 14:58:15 ChrispyFry<br>Man I really like your samples on this. Drums and bass sound great. It seems a little quiet overall, but I loved the melodies and good sound selection and design. I think you could add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to 'the main part' to add some more variation. This is dope though good work.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-09-30 21:50:30 MarkieTheReddit<br>So honestly I like it. Sparce, minimalist and odd. All great thing. I would advise adding a bit more <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at points cuz it does feel like a bit of a lack of progression but yeah. Otherwise good. Heres my beat I submitted https://nagabeats.bandcamp.com/track/s-h-i-n-d-e-i-r-u
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-10-01 00:27:55 PforOpossum<br>I personally learned on youtube videos and hated it so much.  Not having a person physically with you when you're struggling is the most frustrating thing for me.  I taught bass to kids over the summer for extra cash, here's a breakdown of my favorite curriculum, weekly 30 min lessons over the school break:

1. What the pieces of the bass are and how to use it.  Just google it if you need to.
2. Play smoke on the water all on the E string.  Great starter riff.  Classic.  Builds strength in fingers, learn slides.
3. Blitzkrieg Bop to get them to start using other strings.
4. The next longest step is teaching to use all 4 fingers.  I used 7 nation army and an A scale to get them to start spreading out their fingers.
5. Little bit of music theory to help understand why the string are laid out how they are.  This isn't necessary, but helps with learning down the road.
6. Rudimentary chords.  Not actually playing them, again just kind of music theory.
7. Punk rock has really easy bass a lot of the time (Ramones, Minor Threat) and the bass follow the guitar so is easy to hear.  This is a long stage again.  Lot's of songs.
8. I use Interpol, my favorite band, later on because their bass is pretty distinct and is a good intro to melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in bass.
9. After that, it's just practice.  I'll ask them to learn a song or two over the weeks of increasing difficulty.  This is actually good, constantly challenging yourself is the best way I've found to improve.  Having a teacher saying that it's possible, and that it's assigned, is helpful, but sometimes you need to challenge yourself.  

I loved teaching those damn rat children.  Feel free to ask any questions of me, or really anyone on the subreddit.  We all like to see another bass player.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-10-01 02:09:45 Okythoosx<br>This goes hard, with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> maybe pitch it down in/ slow it down in some areas again the drop it back in. 

just a few more transitions maybe.  dope beat
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-10-01 02:18:32 Okythoosx<br>I agree with what other people are saying, some variation/ higher pitching of the melody would really complete the track, adding some bells or even just moving the melody up in a section would be good to keep the listener interested. Or having some parts where you had just a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> going so it doesn't feel so repetitive. Really enjoyed it though
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-01 04:14:09 BoothBeatz<br>I like this a lot. The melodies are great and the 808 hits great. Good use of slides without going way overboard like a lot of people do.

I'd make the flute louder though, some of the lower notes get drowned out as of now. Also maybe think of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> just to break it up a little bit so it doesn't get overly repetitive.

&amp;#x200B;

Beware these terms: Arrangement and Transcription

Transcription - Taking a piece and setting the parts to other instrumentation. The key may be changed, but the structure is otherwise unaltered.

Arrangement - Using a pre-written piece as the foundation and structure of your version, but making minor changes. Example: Lost woods, but you add your own bridge piece in between sections. Or, you use the theme as it is and create new harmonies to go with it 

Variation - Using the original as a frame of reference, but altering the structure, harmony, and melody significantly to change the feel of the overall piece (Rozen and Theophany are good examples of composers who use variation).

&amp;#x200B;

A serious consideration: use articulation, use tempo, and use dynamics. These three things can make even simple midi music way more interesting to the listener.

&amp;#x200B;

This next part isn't said to be mean, only to be honest so you know what your audience is hearing: This sounds like you took a midi from [vgmusic.com](https://vgmusic.com) , ran it through a fifteen year old copy of *Finale*, assigned instruments, then hit record. It should like you want to make a wood wind choir version of this piece, cool, perhaps your spin on this will be fun, BUT you kept the tempo at the original speed which is a little boring, you didn't use any articulation other than legato, and the volume was near constant. Peel the piece apart at a harmoic and structural level and you'll see that you have room to play with all of that to make a more unique and enjoyable experience for your version of this piece.

&amp;#x200B;

***THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE A BAD PERSON AND IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD GIVE UP.*** It means that you're at the start of your journey and as you learn you will improve. If you work hard, study your music, learn how to really maximize the output quality, then you will find that you will be successful AND profitable! There's no shame in making money here! Go for it! You may be able to leverage this into a job writing video game music for a living!

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to recommend something under the assumption you know nothing about music. I'm not saying you're an idiot, I just don't know the limits of your music education.

* Learn piano and violin

Take it seriously, get good, play some challenging stuff from the baroque, classical, and romantic eras. That will give you a feel for how music flows. Those two instruments are two of the three most popular instruments on earth, the third is guitar and if you know violin then guitar isn't that hard because the fundamentals are the same.

* Take music theory courses at a community college

If you're old enough and you're not in a music program already at a university, take REAL music theory. Guitar-oriented music theory is not really good. They'll teach you riffs, but not the meat and potatoes of how music works. When you do this, you need to remember that theory is only a GUIDE, not a rule. I used to write a lot of music and I was starting to get okay at it then I let the theory overwhelm me because I tricked myself into thinking that I HAD to follow EVERY LITTLE RULE....I didn't. Theory offers guidelines that help you choose the best way to communicate your ideas. 

* Take some digital music production classes

Learning piano will help you here because a computer assisted piano can record what you play WAY faster than entering it manually. If you know you want to use a bass line that goes 1-7-6-5 and resolves to 1 then you play it, then you switch to your harmony and play your I-V-IV-V progression. (yes, I deliberately wrote my advice like that, I want to challenge you to learn that and to use it. It's simple, yet effective).

* Study people like Melodysheep, Rozen, and Theophany. 

All three of them are absolutely fantastic at composition and audio production. Learn how they use major and minor to alter mood, learn how they use dissonance to create tension where there previously was none. How do they use modes? How do they use dynamics? How do those dynamics weave across each other (because they do more than just make things loud and soft)? How does the articulation of the different parts (melody, counter-melody, harmony, bass line, and percussion) affect the feel and energy of the piece overall AND in each individual segment of the whole? How does tempo play into this?

&amp;#x200B;

You like video games and video game music, you can be financially successful with this. It will just take time and persistence.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-02 14:57:45 WreQz<br>It’s way too busy for my tastes. You use a lot of hat rolls, 808 slides, and the off tempo claps (which seems intended and doesn’t sound bad). In place of crazy drum play, I would use a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> switch up, or switch up which percs you use for each section.

Mix sounded good on my phone, I’ll come back to you when i listen in the car. Also, I feel I’m pretty novice, so my criticism is not really for improvement necessarily, but to try something different for the next song.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-03 03:13:43 6_Stringsthagod<br>I see what you were going for, I think the mix needs to be better specifically the 808 I think should be much louder and the kick should be hitting harder too.

</p></li><li><p><b>osumapping</b> 2019-10-04 10:03:37 M4sterRed<br>&gt; but does this idea encompass the concept of connecting structure of rhythm choice/the map to the music?

Yes. Otherwise, it would feel like the song or piece that the mapper chose doesn’t belong here.

&gt; also, how would you handle certain layers of a songs instrumentation having noticeably different emphasis from the "main" layer(s) then, assuming one wants to have some reflection of it in rhythm choice? is it best to just ignore it? i recognize this surely would depend a lot on context, but just generally speaking, is the general rhythmical structure of the map more valuable than reflecting an individual section?

As a musician, I do think mapping the “new things” is important. However, I won’t do it the same way depending on the importance of each layer in a section of a song or piece. If a counter-melody suddenly appears for 1 or 2 measures and ends after that, there’s a good chance it’s the most important layer for these few measures, so I’ll map it actively. On the other hand, when the counter-melody plays for a long period of time, it’s usually the second most important layer, so I’ll map it more passively like how I would do with the percussions.

Note: take what I just wrote with a grain of salt, because I’m only at my 5th map.

OLD BARONESS........

First &amp; Second

Red

Blue

NEW BARONESS........

Yellow &amp; Green

Purple

Gold &amp; Grey

In my opinion, their old stuff is much better. Baroness was first and foremost a guitar-driven band. It was all
about the melody and counter-melody of two guitars. Very stripped back mix. John Dyer Baizley's vocals were coarse and gritty and raw. It was awesome. Lots of long instrumental passages. And the lyrics were really something to chew on. Very poetic. A truly unique band.

The new stuff is much more kinda pop-punk. They're now a vocal-driven band, and it's obvious just from the mix. John's vocals are really soul-ish, and for me personally, it doesn't work most of the time. The lyrics are accessible to a wider audience.

Baroness hasn't been a metal band for years. But I say *let them do what they want*. I'm sure they've expanded their following. I just personally don't enjoy their newer stuff. And I think most Mastodon fans prefer old Baroness.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-10-05 17:27:37 Gmonie5<br>Something that really helped me is to leave your room for 5 minutes. Then come back in and listen to your song standing up in a different position in your room.

Then write notes about what you think you could add to improve it. I try to split my thinking up into things like: arrangement, muting, drum rolls, special FX, risers, textures, foley.

Then also think about instrumentation (in regards to frequency range) does it want some Bells? Pads for warmth? Synth lead? Layered Melody? <b><u>Counter melody</u></b>? I’ve written a list of all the different types of instruments and samples I have which I regularity refer to if things stop working. 

Another great tip is to write down (as u can tell I’m a big fan of notes!) specific techniques that you have learnt such as creating randomised  breakbeats from triggering a midi arp etc. 

Suddenly u have a list of lots of different directions to take your project. 

One more thing which helps is to do producer walkthroughs on sites like ADSR and Macprovideo and actually follow on your own DAW. Something about learning by doing that really helps it stick. 

This inability to finish project plagues a lot of us music producers. Don’t lose heart. Good luck!

</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2019-10-07 10:37:13 Akamas1735<br>Think of the guitar solo section as a place for the listener to take a break from the main sections of the song. The guitar solo provides a melodic or harmonic interlude using scale notes or chord tones. It's a place to create a repeat of the melody, a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, or harmonic strings (riffs) of notes that compliment the chords using scale notes or chord tones. You are creating a little song that can be melodic, repetitive, or percussive (in that it reinforces the beat of the song).

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-10 05:30:38 Tingzorz<br>I like the vibe, the standard trap drums work well in this beat. the piano melody is a bit simple, feel free to add new percussions or a new counter-melody just to switch things up. other than that, this is a pretty solid instrumental, so keep up the good work!

</p></li><li><p><b>greenday</b> 2019-10-10 23:04:09 freakdotcom<br>So uh, I love it. 

BJ keeps adding instruments and musical counter melodies throughout the song. Second verse, he adds the organ and some octave guitar stuff in line with the musical <b><u>counter melody</u></b> between the lyrics. Second chorus adds a really sick sounding guitar harmony throughout. The Ramones/Riverdales sounding bridge groove.

Just because they've expanded their sound musically, doesn't mean they've lost touch. The lyrics are very Green Day. The very first one is about a whistle blower being a liar. 

Everyone needs to stop expecting Dookie or American Idiot and just appreciate the music. Go in with zero expectations and you'll be blown away.

Maybe in funk songs it is.  I don’t know.  I’m not schooled in music but I don’t think a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> actually counters the main melody, despite the name. It/they support it.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-12 13:41:26 nothinggoldmusic<br>Not bad. Maybe missing a lead/<b><u>counter Melody</u></b> to the one that all the synths are playing. I also kind of like it open, sometimes easier to do vocals on, but the arrangement really needs to move the song forward to keep it interesting.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-10-13 05:03:21 baredex<br>there’s chords with a melody and a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. not really sure what your talking about.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-13 05:26:32 magixone_<br>If you made that beat then it's good enough for a type beat ngl I dig it foreals. 

Idk about the vocals, it sounded buried in the mix on my end. 

I'm not sure where you going with this but the beat sounds nice enough. 

I think that <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is off beat that starts at 1:11

Here's mine

</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-10-13 09:18:32 silevesq<br>I took a classical guitar class last winter and ever since I've been using some technic. I think it just need to have a reason. If you are looking for that sound. If this let you achieve sound or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that wouldn't be possible other way. 

IMHO I don't care how you are playing, but is the result great?
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-10-13 21:40:12 TheDarkReshiram<br>Sick guitar melody, the bass is smooth and mixed pretty well so it sounds tight when it kicks in. I like the vocal slices in the background, they're really subtle but add a lot to the beat. Also like how you switched up the pace of the beat with the different hi hat pattern and changed the riff.

Not really much to say in terms of mixing, it's pretty on point tbh. I like the beat and there isn't anything bad specifically, but it takes a while during the "bridge", or whatever you'd call it, before the drop comes back. The beat is pretty slow throughout and you could add a more hyped up section, but if that's the vibe you're going for I'd say it works well. The high frequencies are fairly empty, so a higher pitch counter-melody would turn out pretty well imo. Good work, really original compared to most trap sounding beats you'd hear.
</p></li><li><p><b>synthrecipes</b> 2019-10-13 22:56:02 Protegit<br>&gt; LFOs don't track perfectly (in other words, if you use them as oscillators, their pitch is off) 

This might be true for analogue, but I cant think of a reason the pitch would be off in a sofware synth, especially taking into consideration that an FM soft synth doesnt know which operator a sound designer will use as an LFO or as a 'normal' oscilator. The computer shouldnt care how you use these sounds. If you specify one sound to be 220Hz it sohuld be 220Hz no matter how its used. Maybe I just misunderstood you. 

&gt; Applying a filter to a flute would get the character right 

what filter? There definitly is an LP filter on it and thats it I think. 

Anyway I just noticed that the bass sound is not the LFO. Its a separate sound that acts as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> (a really faint one).

&gt; What did you use to recreate it with? 

I tried it in Sytrus. Here an mp3 of the attempt.

</p></li><li><p><b>SmallYTChannel</b> 2019-10-14 03:27:22 Drip_empire<br>This is really dope! Honestly i dont think it needs a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> as the melody does great on its own. I think what people were meaning by it loops is is the drum arrangement. Which is great btw i think! But it goes from what sounds like a hook to a verse and back to a hook with out transitioning as much as it could. 

The hook is the highest energy in drum arrangement(there are exceptions) therefor you have the hook down and the begining of the verse down! I think all you really would add to keep from sounding looped would be to transition from no drums to “all drums” (aka the hook) 

What what i normally do is drop to low drums at the begining of the verse( just like you did perfectly) but then i slowly add high hats, kicks and increasing the energy leading up to the next hook!

This is a high quality track already! I hoped this helped!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-14 12:33:02 lzyv<br>i think the bassline is pretty good, it fits the bounce the beat already has. overall the beat is good, but if it were me i would add another simple <b><u>counter melody</u></b> just to give it a little more variety. but with vocals over it it should be fine without it. good job though man keep grinding.

Really like the percussion you used on this, some of the sounds were really unique and cool, but i’d add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the beat too. The marimba melody is nice but it’s like a two bar loop and by the end i was kinda waiting for it to change up at least once, so i think some variation would be really cool
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-15 11:06:44 The_IndigoKid<br>This is cool but you still need a bit more practice.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-15 20:09:04 dumbass_alex<br>It's pretty nice beat, but your bass is almost non-existent, maybe if you made it louder, or went for a bass with a lil bit longer decay, it would be nicer, and i wish you created some <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to spice things up, but it's my preference.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-15 20:24:44 agenttomato69<br>I think it could go for a bit of a stronger 808 or kicks when all of the drums come in, it would match the style you are going for. I like the melody, but I think a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> coming in later would also benefit the track and make it overall less generic sounding. Overall good vibe.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-16 01:17:33 Strooble<br>I almost think the low pad is a bit toooooo low in this to really get that r&amp;b feel.

Definitely a beat with a lot of r&amp;b influence though. I like the percussion. I'd like to hear something a little more colourful, something in the high end to spice it up, maybe as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. 

https://soundcloud.com/kane_beats/lowest-in-the-room-demo-3 here's mine, I remade the highest in the room guitar melody and built my own beat around it. Any feedback would be amazing.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-16 02:36:00 J0hnnyboyyy<br>The sample chopping and arrangement at the beginning leading into the drop was dope.  

I think it could be nice to add an instrumental <b><u>counter melody</u></b> from about the 25 second mark until the vocals return.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-16 08:04:24 soda711<br>Melody/<b><u>counter melody</u></b>, 808s/ bass or hi hats, snare/claps, kick, percs/ sfx. I think each producer has a specialty in a couple areas over others and with that being said the creative flow comes with what order you do.
</p></li><li><p><b>brass</b> 2019-10-16 23:14:16 NotAlwaysGifs<br>Overall I like it.  It has a good mix of lyrical and technical to show of their mastery of each.

My only two criticisms would be:

1. Give your piano player a break, those quarter note sections are going to be a slog.  You can add a bit more interest by duplicating the melody more often or even giving them a simple running <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  An accompaniment doesn't need to just provide the chords.
2. Go easy on the extended technique.  Unless you have a real reason to use it, it can sound forced unless you have a reason to use it.  For example, you might use the gliss to draw attention to a specific instrument's part over a densely composed section of music.  Here it adds interest the first time it happens, but then you kind of go, "Ok, where is it going from here?"
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-17 05:41:53 666Tokyo<br>Really like how full the guitar sounds, simple but effective melody, the percussion is clean overall, really like the cymbols or whatever, 808s are hard. Kinda feel like hitting some higher notes with the main melody or a more subtle <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would sound nice.

</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-10-17 22:47:33 Royaleworki<br>I actually like the melody fam ad some hihats on that maybe change the snare to a clap, put some snares in between the claps for some bounce (idk the proper term for it) but that would make a big difference alone and is essentially what a trap beat even is lol

Maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for the chorus and fuck around with effects a lot (Grossbeat is fun)

At this stage just experiment fam nd when you feel like your experiments are sounding a lot better go on youtube and look at tutorials on the type beats you enjoy so you can incorporate those into your sound. DONT do that super soon bc you dont want to sound generic... make sure you have your own foundation laid out THEN analyze to see what more you need to level up
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-18 05:50:53 PHPLights<br>I feel like when the beat drops there isn't enough going on. It seems too drastic of a cut. Perhaps when there some vocals on it that would change but it just seems like there is so much dead space. Maybe try adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to add some depth to it? definitely an easy beat to rap to but perhaps too basic for my personal taste
</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-10-18 06:38:31 johnzhang0812<br>this sounds great, the mix is clean, the vocals are clear, the drums slap; I'd want some more interesting production, perhaps a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and a longer runtime, I'm left wanting more :)

Pay close attention to the cool slinky bass groove under the chords in the verse.  Cool little counter-melody going on there that I didn’t notice on the first few listens

I’ve heard Dave sing this tune dozens of times, from the early days of the band through modern concerts and I have NO idea how he has the stamina to get through a double chorus of “I don’t owe you anything” AND the “I’ll stick around” bit.  That’s a lot of barking!

10/10, classic Foo.

Dave did say this one was of the first songs he wrote where he actually wrote a more adventurous, different bass line, instead of just largely following the guitar track.
</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-10-19 17:59:59 Nozeit<br>The vocal wasn’t quite what I was expecting. I think there’s the basis of a good song here. However I think if your going to do a proper version of this then the versus need to have a lot more going on in them. The drums are very sparse, the guitar very basic chords and the bass just following the guitar pretty exactly (and pretty quiet if it’s there at all). Think you need to add some <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something else to engage the listener.
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-10-19 21:05:30 jjankel<br>Kick and bass sound pretty good actually, maybe a touch too muddy. 

Snare lacks snap did you apply the reverb to the sample directly or is that just how it sounds? If so try layering it with something that has a bit more presence. 

Not sure about the lead sound, its a bit basic but the melody it plays is fine. 

Generally, I think the track could do with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> for interest.
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2019-10-20 01:07:52 The_Original_Gronkie<br>Not just guitar or music related, but all my life I've noticed that a lot of people tend to over-engineer stuff. They just tend to make things more complicated than they need to be.

Instead, I've always had the philosophy of trying to find the "simplest and most elegant" solution that accomplishes the same thing. I apply that philosophy to everything in life. If something is complicated, figure out the objectives you are trying to achieve, and then find a way of achieving those objectives in as simple and elegant a way as possible. 

It often works for music as well. Simplify your music  to the bare elements that are required - rhythm, melody, harmony. Once you have those, then your song is basically finished, so all you have to do is add something a little extra to make it great - a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, an interesting harmony, an atmospheric sound, etc. But you can't add all of that or you end up with mud. 

The simplest and most elegant solution that meets the objectives. That's the path.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-20 12:44:53 Knarmer<br>Not a bad track I love the guitar nicely played, would say it needs another instrument Aswell to change it up a bit more and give it abit more energy, or maybe a distortion automation on the guitar or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with keys, here's one of mine if you have time for feedback

</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriters</b> 2019-10-21 01:08:13 Holiday_Volume<br>Thanks! This is our first song but im gonna let you in on a little secret, we both played the piano and looped, I then later added more melody to it, as well as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>FLStudioBeginners</b> 2019-10-21 12:05:17 2slowforanewname<br>Ya either that or maybe a mid range synth, an octave? Or so higher than that solid mid bass you have, maybe even have it play a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, would probably tie it all together. You need that "glue"
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-21 16:11:49 Swilloww<br>Damn your 808 is really hard, the kick that goes with it too. I find it a little bit too loud, but it's a matter of taste i think.

Anyway the beat is strong. The melody is simple and on point. Drums pattern is clean.

So like i said if i have something to criticize, it's the fact that the 808 is somehow too loud for me (personal opinion) and like the other dude said it's kinda repetitive, perhaps a section with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or some effects would spice it up a bit.

Wish you the best of all ! :)

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-10-22 03:45:53 shrimptrizkit<br>Delay, change velocity to accent notes and vary note placement for some swing/bounce. You could add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to that in higher register.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-22 05:47:51 Tingzorz<br>I like the chill vibe, the sound selection is pretty good. the melodies are nice, you also have enough headroom to add new layers. if I were you, I would try adding vocal pads and new percussions (shakers maybe?). the counter-melody that starts at 1:35 is okay, but I would suggest adding reverb and stereo enhancer to make it feel wider. other than that, I can't really complain. keep up the good work!

</p></li><li><p><b>G59</b> 2019-10-22 07:08:43 KellsOMN<br>its not even accurate lol theres a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> before the drop
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-10-22 20:00:00 hunterisagrump<br>it's the idea of melody vs <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. a lot of it comes down to timing. 

if the vocal starts BEFORE the 1 on the chorus, the countermelody can start on the 2 and resolve before the 1. 

&amp;#x200B;

one of my favorite examples of this is Depeche Mode - Shake the Disease. Alan Wilder, the more production-savvy member of the band at the time, was into artists like Phillip Glass, where the songs is made of looping hooks or riffs or melodies, rather than just full chord strums.
</p></li><li><p><b>drums</b> 2019-10-22 21:42:15 bladexnl<br>I'm honestly edging towards adding a second ride over a crash as well.    
The only times I really use my crash more than once in a while is towards the end of a solo section to accent whatever they are playing, but the ride is by far my favorite part of the kit.    


I really love pulling a bunch of different tones out of the ride, switching between the bell and other sections to provide sort of a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to other instruments and things like that.    
I honestly rarely go a song without switching from the hihat to the ride at least once, so having an entirely different sounding ride (maybe something darker) to break the monotony might be more beneficial, especially since my current ride is already very crashable
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-10-23 01:06:09 BruhImSkill<br>Thanks! I was sort of thinking the same thing, was getting inspired by "Crushed Up" by Future so that's where the idea came from lol, but I just wanted to give the beat a cool <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, so a different synth is always a possibility.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-23 03:36:51 ProdDR<br>I really fw this melody but I feel like adding some kind of counter-melody could take this beat to the next level. I don't mean for the whole beat but maybe for the hook

Your beats definitely got a similar vibe. Did you do thst guitar melody? I like that a lot. I think we got similar tastes for sure. Only thing I think that would make it stand out more would be some more knock but I'm biased on that
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-23 09:04:35 veryyoungandhandsome<br>Sounds really dope!  As another poster said I would recommend just adding a B section or adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.  The initial loop is really tough, it'll help keep the track fresh by just bringing in a few other elements!

Here's my track:

[https://soundcloud.com/thedjprettyboi/e-40-tell-me-when-to-go-prettyboi-lofi-remix](https://soundcloud.com/thedjprettyboi/e-40-tell-me-when-to-go-prettyboi-lofi-remix)
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-23 20:40:10 stick7_<br>I get where you're coming from and somewhat agree. However, a "vibe" is essentially nothing more than a feeling. If you can convert that feeling into music - it doesn't really matter if you create it all in the studio or somewhere else. If I'm being honest 9.5 times out of 10 when I work with artists, they don't give fuck if I make the chords, the melody, the nuances, the this, the that, in the studio. They just want something that captures the vibe - period. The most they're going to say is "I want something dark, yet ambient, and bit of this, and that". In this situation, you should have hundreds of midis that capture different vibes. 


Artist wants something dark? Got prepared midis for that style.
Artist wants something ambient? Got prepared midis.
Artist wants something tropical? Got prepared midis.
 
And so forth. 

Key factor here is this though. They should be midis; something you can easily change to suit a different vibe. Perhaps the artist isn't feeling the last chord - you can change that up. Whilst with a loop, you can't really. Also, having prepared midis allows you build shit off it. You can instantly create a counter-melody that changes the whole vibe (etc etc). 

I'm not saying you're wrong; it's probably "well looked upon" if you can create in the studio, but as i've said, majority of the time it's meaningless.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-23 22:38:28 Beastintheomlet<br>I think it's best to view the bass as being the glue between the guitar/piano and the drums. When you listen to music like focus on how the bass interlocks with the drums and then listen to how it plays with the harmony. Bass has a really important roll with making everything feel like a single unit. 

As far as writting bass remember that it is the final deciding factor of what chord is being played and controls the momentum. So harmonically, if the piano plays a chord progression of C major - G major - F major - G major it'll sound like I-V-IV-V and very major. But if you add the bass notes A-G-D-E under those chord we now hear the very same piano part as Am7-G-Dm7-Em7, or i^(7)-VII-iv^(7)-v^(7) which is definitely minor. 


In terms of momentum, even if only playing the root of the chord the rhythm and subdivision the bass is playing has a major impact on the feel of the song. A bass playing half notes vs eighth notes have very different implications for the song. 

The bass can also be used to smooth out transitions between chords by walking or ascending/descending to the next chords root note. It can be used to play a riff/ostinato that the rest of the music plays around with. The bassline can also act as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the main melody.

The last thing I'll say is that bass is frequently under utilized in a lot of genres and styles, but it's a very powerful element of any song.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-24 02:29:29 Beastintheomlet<br>One of the hallmark sounds of Punk and Metal is pretty thick distortion and generally speaking the heavier the distortion the more basic your chords need to be. 7th chords just flat out do not sound the same through heavy distortion, even triads can get pretty muddy which is why the heavier sides of rock like punk and metal use almost exclusively power chords on guitar (only the root and the fifth). 

As far as adding spice both punk and metal would have different avenues. Punk really doesn't add spice, it's ethos and structure is taking elements of pop and distilling them down to their absolute basic components. You can really here this distillations when you listen punk covers of pop songs, the band Me First and The Gimme Gimmes are a great example of how punk covers can really distill this down. If jazz is KFC with 11 herbs and spices punk rock is a bowl of cereal, and you don't really add hot sauce to cereal. If anything punk rock adds interest (a better way to frame it in my opinon) reductively. It'll start the song as bare bones as possible and then add small differents to build interest. The verse or begining of the song will be slower in terms of subdivisions (strumming in 8th notes instead of 16ths) or the guitar part will be muted which let's you play wide open later for contrast. 

Metal would spice things with ornamentation, typically the harmony/chord progression would also be heavily distorted power chords but there is typically a lead guitar part as well that acts to add color to the harmony, do call and response with the melody or act as <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. 

For both Punk and Metal you really can't overlook your rhythm section either, tactful movement and contrast on bass and true finesse even at fast tempos on drums are truly one of the biggest aspects that separates the mediocre from the great in those genres.

</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2019-10-24 08:17:38 RichMusic81<br>Minstrels is for the most part (to be overly simple) a basic bass line accompaniment.

Les Collines alternates between matching the right hand in terms of rhythm, an accompaniment figure, <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and bass line.

Obviously both oversimplifications.
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-10-24 22:54:33 TLBeats<br>A lot of good parts. Look for more LoFi vibey drum kits. Also that main <b><u>counter melody</u></b> was just too loud. You got a vibe going tho fam keep it up
</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-10-25 03:00:03 magixone_<br>The drums are unique imo, I dig your percs.
I wish the guitar was mix a little bit better like removing some harsh frequencies &amp; low mids a bit, then adding a subtle reverb.

You should add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to compliment the guitar because it's a bit empty. 

Three switch ups? Wow that's cool. I don't think this could be artist friendly imo but it could a hard beat if executed right like 808 slides going ham etc etc..

5.5 out of 10 (:
</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-10-25 03:21:22 magixone_<br>I like the piano selection imo. I think the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> was good but two notes were off &amp; including that ahh vocal sample. You should add rc20 to add that vintage lofi feel on all melodies. 

I like your arrangements &amp; subtle piano chops however so gj on that.

The mix sounds muddy each time the bass hits so choose a different sample or link the bass eq band to a controller that's on the kick.

5 out of 10 for me (:
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-26 19:19:29 dumbass_alex<br>That's pretty good, but your vocals draw to much influence from travis, like it didn't feel that unique or memorable, 808's are pretty good (might need a liltle more distortion tho), melody gets a little bit repetitive, maybe some switch up, ambience or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> could help.

“Sorry boys, I should’ve fixed the bell for her years ago.”

Sha-gra bobbed his head, incorporating the sound into his ongoing performance. He pressed the broken doorbell, over and over, an irritating counter-melody that grew in tandem with the music from his violin. Bork’s base line of raspy breaths gave the irritating cacophony an ominous tone.

A sigh rattled from my chest. “Look,” I said, “I know you’re nervous. So am I. But this is Thanksgiving, the one time of the year I can see my non-supervillain family. Can’t we make the most of it?”

Sha-gra stopped his serenade. “Yessir,” he said. His voice was as soft and silky as my favorite pajamas.

Bork simply nodded.

The door opened, warm streams of light beating back the night. The dense smell of turkey, the creamy smell of mashed potatoes, and still other scents wafted towards us. It wasn’t just my stomach that rumbled.

“Hello, Mother,” I said, “We brought the Brussel sprouts. I hope you don’t mind, but I brought the boy—”

“Don’t just stand there boy!” she said. “We can’t have y’all freezing out in the cold, dark night.”

Ushering us inside, she grabbed the Brussel sprouts and hurried towards the kitchen, a bundle of matronly energy.

I turned to apologize to the boys, only to see they had disappeared. A grunt came from the kitchen, and I turned in time to see the wrought-iron chandelier swinging. Bork rubbed the fleshy part of his head, grumbling his rumbling mumble.
I sighed, shut the door, and made my way towards the kitchen.

_____________________________________________________

I had never seen the dining room table so crowded.

It was made for six. Mother occupied the head of the table. My grandmother was to her left, and Sha-gra occupied the seat beside my grandmother, serenading her with music she couldn’t hear. I sat at the other end of the table, while my little brother sat to my left, and Bork sat between my brother and my mother.

Poor Bork. He had to move a stump in from outside. Couldn’t have the dining room chairs breaking under his weight.

The spread of food was classic Thanksgiving fare. A massive turkey, probably thirty pounds, enough to feed a family of four for a week. A huge ceramic container of mashed potatoes, little flower patterns tracing along the outside. Corn, beans, salad, buns, ham, Brussel sprouts. We weren't missing anything.

And we still wouldn’t have leftovers.

“Bork, pass the—”

“Ssshhhh,” Bork said, before realizing who he was talking too. His face went beet red, and he slouched into his stump. 

“Don’t worry Bork, it’s Thanksgiving,” I said. “I won’t hurt you. Tonight, anyway.”

“You finished your yapping, Sammy?” Mother said. “The foods gonna go cold if we don’t say grace.”

I shut up, closed my eyes, and clasped my hands together. I wasn’t normally in the habit of prayer, but family dinners were different.

Mother mumbled some gobbeldy-gook about *Oh* *Lord,* *blesseth* *the* *table* *before* *you,* and *We* *give* *thanks* *for* *our* *daily* *bread.* It seemed strange that we only gave thanks for the bread. I was sure as hell looking forward to the turkey.

Finished, Mother opened her eyes, and started dishing up a plate for my grandmother. I followed her example, and reached for the container of mashed potatoes. 

Sha-gra dished up a small serving of everything for himself. I helped Bork amass a collection of food that could feed a small country, as Mother looked on approvingly. With all the necessary conditions met, we tucked into our meal.

I had taken a single bite of deliciously moist turkey before it began.

“Soooo, how are things going with Silvertongue?” Mother said.

“Hmm?” I said, around a mouthful of turkey. “Wh’ou ‘ean?”

“I saw about the date at the local coffee shop,” Mother said. “When do I get to meet her?”

I swallowed in surprise, and choked on a too-big mouthful of turkey. Bork slammed me on the back as I coughed, and turkey sprayed all across my dinner plate. Lovely.

“I was threatening her, Mother,” I said. “Altered her tea so it would incapacitate her, after which I could bring her back to my base and torture her for the whereabouts of—”

“You mean you bought her a cup’o’tea?

I sighed. “Yes,” I said, “and it would’ve worked too, if she hadn’t used her powers of persuasion to force my to reveal what I had—”

“Sounds like a pretty half-assed plan,” Mother said, picking at her turkey. “You sure you wanted to torture her?”

Sha-gra and Bork sniggered.

I could feel the heat rushing to my cheeks. “Okay, it wasn’t my best laid plan, I’ll admit,” I said. “But believe me, the intent was there!”

“You didn’t answer my question,” Mother said.

“Yes, I wanted to torture her!” I said, my voice rising. “I’ve been trying for years.”

“‘Ounds kinky,” my grandmother said.

“Nanna!” I yelled.

“Not at the dinner table, Sammy,” Mother said. “It’s unholy.”

I sat in my chair. 

My mother glanced at me, playing with her food. “Look,” she said. “I know you, Samson. Masterfully laid plans are your specialty. And when you design a plan with the intent to succeed, you don’t fail. What happened, boy?”

“Nothing!” 

“You like her, don’t you?” Mother said. 

“No!”

“I’ve always wanted some grandkids,” Mother said, hugging herself and gracing the table with a warm, contented smile.

“It’s not happening!” I said.

“If not now, then when?” Mother shot back. “You’re thirty-five, boy! You’re getting old, outside your prime, but not old enough yet to be a silver-fox. What are you going to do if love passes you by?”

“Love is for weaklings,” I said.

“Spoken like a true coward,” Mother said, her eyes flashing a steely blue. 

Silence blanketed the table like a fog. Bork and Sha-gra stared dutifully at their plates of food. My brother poked at Bork’s metal arm, his face tinged green. From envy or nausea, I couldn’t tell.

I looked at my mother. Her steely gaze met my own. Tears welled in the corner of my eyes.

I stood up. “May I be excused?”

She stared a moment longer, before flicking her hand towards the door. “Go,” she said.

I left the room.
_____________________________________________________

I was swinging my legs off the eaves of the house, like I used to do as a kid, when my mother found me.

“Can I join you, Sammy?” she said.

“It’s a free country,” I said. *For* *now,* I thought.

“You’ve always liked dangling your feet, haven’t you?” she said.

I swung my legs a little harder in answer.

She smiled. “I’m sorry for dinner,” she said. “I’m just worried about you. It doesn’t do to have a man your age trying to take over the world.”

“Why not?” I asked.

“Cause there are better ways to do it!” she said. “Politics are all the rage these days. Every good supervillain’s a part of it.”

“Call me an old soul,” I said.

“You’re old.”

“Hey!”

She chuckled. Then waved towards the front lawn. I could see Bork rolling in the grass, freshly mown this morning, while my brother rolled beside him. They fell into a heap, laughing. It would cost me an arm and a leg to get those clothes washed at the black market laundromat.

 “I love you Samson,” she said. “And I want you to be happy. Isn’t it time you gave a thought to your own happiness? To stop trying to change the world for the better, and instead live the life you want to live?”

“I’m a supervillain, Mother,” I said. “I am living for my own happiness.”

She patted me on the shoulder. “Whatever you say, dear,” she said. “I’m going back inside. Feel free to join us for pie.”
She climbed back through the window, the flower-patterned curtains billowing in the breeze.

I looked up at the night sky. Star after star flickered at me, a brilliant display that I had loved every since I was a child. I pondered a while, before making up my mind.

“Maybe it’s time to give love a shot,” I said, before making my way through the open window.

_____________________________________________________

Across the road, a woman lay on her stomach upon the shingles of a worn house. Her normally silver jumpsuit was coloured a charcoal black. She kicked her legs in the air, while peering through camo-patterned children’s binoculars, far too small for her. A smile spread across her face.

“Got him,” she said. “Hook, line, and sinker.”

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-27 04:02:32 Dr_Aven_Beats<br>To me it depends, but most of times this is my order: chords / sample - melody / <b><u>counter melody</u></b> - clap/snare - hats - percussions - kick - fx - 808s - mix &amp;master

After a couple of years I feel confident with this order and especially now that I have to make at least 1 beat per day it really helps me when I got a block or I don't feel inspired.

At the same time there could be times when I would do it in a random order or the other way around, I believe that it is only by experimenting that we get to experience new stuff nd maybe make something unexpectedly crazy. 

All in all keeping an order as you do keeps you on track especially when the time and pressure you have is high but to never limit ourselves and to try new ways is always a recommended thing!

Hope this helps you getting a different perspective, if you want to talk more or just want to collab hit me up here or on IG at dr.avenbeats !

Have a great day and keep grinding!

It's not just the theme played on some other instruments, there is even a counter-melody and no dissonance at all. And the video looks really good. You have some serious talent dude.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-27 08:55:01 nvduhn<br>Looking for <b><u>counter melody</u></b> ideas really. Just curious how people see this developing. Really having fun with it

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-10-27 12:39:33 goldschool333<br>First I feel as though the 808 needed a bit more movement in the track.  It gets repetitive and boring hearing the 808 hit the same note over and over again ya feel?  Also, a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would have done this track some good justice because the chords sound good like its a decent progression but also gets boring after a while to hear the same thing.  moreover, you could have been more creative with the beat structure overall.  you have points where you take out the kick and 808 and leave the clap and hihat and thats fine, but maybe switching up the hihat pattern or adding another melody in those points or adding/removing more instruments would have kept me more engaged with the track instead of it being so predictable.  overall it needs more work but you have a solid foundation which by itself should be enough motivation to keep on practicing because youre not gonna get better without it.  keep it up bro!

</p></li><li><p><b>TechnoProduction</b> 2019-10-28 11:53:09 columbiansupreme<br>I liked it. Maybe after the first initial "gimme a motherfucking breakbeat" you should add some sort of <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Not necessarily anything radical but a little something to add some variant.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2019-11-01 09:10:51 tasker_morris<br>My general impression is that the steel parts are playing way too much in unison. Try to vary the parts both harmonically and rhythmically like you did at Rehearsal B. 

You could also try using doubles and trillions of parts like how big band arrangements are constructed. Where they’ll play in unison them break off into a harmony over the course of one or two measures.   

Also don underestimate creating ostinao and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> parts. They can help add forward motion and keep melodies lively, respectively.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-02 14:51:11 Petravita<br>Gonna be real, it's hard for me not to get excited about a track sampling Mulan's OST, that's dope no matter how you chop it, ha! My biggest advice here would be some other <b><u>counter melody</u></b>/instrument coming in from time to time (wood flute or something, perhaps?), simply because what we get after the intro is about a minute and a half with very little variation before going into the filtered/low-passed section, and then back to the same.  The balance of the instruments, mix, etc. all sounds fantastic to my ears, I just would have liked to have something breaking up the main body of the beat more often. :)

If you're feeling like some poetry/lo-fi love song vibes, this is my most recent release, but no sweat if you can't get to the feedback right away.  Best of luck with your music!!

</p></li><li><p><b>MusicInTheMaking</b> 2019-11-03 02:59:04 lazarous247<br>I think it needs more space. The chorus to the solo to the outro are very busy and there isn't much separation of those parts. The solo is too shy! It is buried in the mix to the point I almost missed it. Hard to judge without the lyrics or at least the intent of the lyrics, but I think the last 3 parts should have more <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, more space and more distinction from each other.
</p></li><li><p><b>radiohead</b> 2019-11-03 07:01:02 Canker_Core<br>Many times, they use guitar in a more textural way rather than musically. Through his recent Fender signature, you can definitely sense that Ed digs the wonky soundscape vibes. And when they are used more traditionally, they use a lot of melody/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> to fill out the song. It's a lot more composing, a lot less general chording.

Man I really like this! Love the variation in the percussion, love the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and the bassline is crazy!! Really good stuff man. I would say the only thing I've got is get a sexier background - I think that's crucial for type beats. Something really slick/unique, though I think the dog icon is really good/good start.

I really like the build up of this melody. This melody is great, I really vibe with it. Something I have done a lot recently in my beats is use a 808 reversed as a build up, i think it would work great on your initial build up.

Think of a lot of the Gorillaz stuff, the songs and full of melodies all over the place that the rap part is just another <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to my ear forget what they are actually saying.

Art rock, Prog Rock, Electronica, Indie, Motown, Jazz, Funk, Norther Soul, Classical... this is where my interests lie.

Country, Folk, Raw Punk find it hard to get into.... there are exceptions I love Nick Drake but he is a very melodic fingerstyle player.

A song that i adore and the lyrics are almost undecipherable due to english not being her native language is the knifes heartbeats.. that for me might be the greatest produced song for clarity and parts standing out nothing clashing.

as it is it feels very empty and like its missing things. overall its not bad got a decent voice lyrics are okay little bit generic and same with melody but it works well still it is sometimes hard to be original these days

 Need 100% 

\- you need adlibs/ doubling over your main vocals ( emphasizing key words or bars ) 

things to be careful of / try do

\-the start of the song sounds like you made a mistake or mis pronounced something or that might be you accent 

\-also a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> could of worked behind the main one with a high pass filter and lots of reverb (yes vocal melody)

try like huming a melody and using that 

la-da-da-di-da

oh-no-so-slow 

idk hard to do over text

i feel like the main loop's main and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> are a little bland, so its hard to make a true slapper to this.

that being said the compositon is really solid. I love the twists and turns on the beat.

</p></li><li><p><b>TheMotte</b> 2019-11-08 22:42:38 TracingWoodgrains<br>&gt; This subreddit's genetics talk seems the exact same way. Certainly some things are best explained by genetics, and it probably isn't considered quite as much as it should be, but the other extreme of everything always forever being genetic is kind of silly.

I like to think of this subreddit's focus on genetics as [singing the counter-melody](https://sivers.org/counter):

&gt; My advice and opinions may sound strange on their own.

&gt; Do you know what musical counterpoint is? Underneath the main melody, you have a counter-melody that goes against it, and together they make harmony. ...

&gt; Well, if my advice and opinions sound strange, it’s because I’m just the counter-melody.

&gt; I know I’m not the only voice you hear. There’s a common message we all hear these days. Let’s call that the melody.

&gt; I may love that melody, too, but I don’t want to just duplicate it. So I try to think of a good counter-melody.

&gt; I do it to compensate for something I think is missing in the common message. My public writing is a counterpoint meant to complement the popular point.

&gt; Of course I don’t think the stuff I say is the only way to go. I’m just the counter-melody.

&gt; Really I hope you listen to the combination. Eventually you’ll find yourself singing along with the melody you like best, or making up your own. 

In most public discourse, as sargon66 says, genetics gets incredibly little attention. Do I think we sometimes err too much on the other side and attribute too much to it? Yes, absolutely. But I don't want every group to go wrong in the same direction. The focus on genetics here makes a useful and informative counter-melody to the relative silence on it everywhere else.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-11-10 13:52:22 stevewheelermusic<br>Yeah, so I think something a lot of people struggle with is not that they don't know how to write a section with different instruments in it, but how to get there smoothly. There's two big things to consider here: 

1. Transitions from section to section
2. Overall density in the arrangement

Transitions can be a number of different things but some super easy ones include: fills (these can be any instrument; basically a line that's a pattern break that moves more quickly rhythmically), swells (again, many instruments work for this: brass, strings, reverse cymbal, etc), filter sweeps (basically a special use case of a swell), downers, stutters (sort of a fill). There's probably some others I'm not mentioning off the top of my head.

These can be aided by harmonic cadences at the end of your phrases as well. There's a bunch of different types of cadences beyond just typical plagal, authentic, deceptive. For instance, you can do a backdoor cadence of bVII to I. Similarly bIII to I works okay too. 

Overall density: Slightly trickier concept. For a smooth transition, it's often best to maintain a similar amount of density between sections. That is of course unless you're going for the effect of the bottom dropping out on the arrangement or the other shoe dropping when the main beat comes in (think of a big bass drop in an EDM track). 

To size up density, you kind of have to look at what each part of the arrangement is doing. Most arrangements can be broken down into percussion, bass line, melody, and accompaniment. Accompaniment is the most tricky and all encompassing of all of these to get a grip on. Typically, you've only got one bass line and main melody (sometimes <b><u>counter melody</u></b>). You can have many layers of accompaniment. 

The big trick is how many different **rhythmically independent** ideas you have happening at once (as in, things that are playing at the same time but in different rhythmic patterns). This **rhythmic independence** is key to the density equation. If you add more rhythmically independent parts, it will typically be more dense. Subtract, less dense. If my A section has a big synth pad and some brass stabs over it, I can keep this level of density by having pads and stabs in the next section. You have the option though of changing patches in the section. The density stays relatively static, but  the timbre changes. In doing so, you've changed one type of parameter while keeping another relatively unified between the two sections. 

Anyhow, this is getting a little verbose, so I'll cap it here for now. Hopefully it helps, but if you've got questions, please ask.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-11-13 06:17:00 victotronics<br>Nice piece.

1. Use chords other than in root position. For instance that second chord: play it as (bottom-to-top) e-g-c, then you have a counter-melody d-c-b in the left hand. Et cetera.
2. Repeat motifs. The listener needs something to latch onto.
3. Think in terms of phrases that come from something and go to something. For instance, if your piece is in G, make sure that phrases start and end in G. Or have phrase one start in G, end in D, and phrase two go from D to G.
</p></li><li><p><b>playboicarti</b> 2019-11-13 12:45:23 superbade<br>Pretty good man, add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or another instrument in the background if you don’t want it to get too repetitive.
</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-11-13 15:11:58 eyepatch_29<br>I think this song has great potential to be more of a chillhop song than a beat for a rapper to rap on. 

As another user said the snare could be a little louder. 

The melody is repetitive but enjoyable, and the plucks which come sometimes sound really good. 

I love the small percussions which are panned right and left, adds a lot of a life in the beat. 

I think the bass can be improved a lot, it sounds underwhelming, maybe more saturation and distortion. Cut anything below 100hz and increase the mid a little so it hits harder without anymore gain. 

That switch up at the end could be a whole another song, a more flex type beat ? With crazy 808 slides and stuff maybe. It’s 1.5x in halftime if I’m not wrong. Legit digging the last snippet of that switch up. 

So much lost potential because you made it into a beat, this is like taking the most beautiful diamond and playing it in copper. You’ve got one of the best melodies + <b><u>counter melody</u></b> I’ve heard in a while and you put rap drums on it.

They often say less is more, and try not to add too much. The song being basic is unfortunately not something I can agree with, people have way less stuff in their music and it sounds better than mine so that can't be it. Infact there's actually quite a bit going on at any point in time with my song, at minimum 3 unique timbres/rhythms and <b><u>counter melody</u></b>.

But thank you for your time!

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1) Make a good chord progression.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2) Make a basic yet catchy melody using same keys in the chords but octave or two higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

Step 3) Make a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with any other key to add some spice and flavor to it.
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-11-15 09:51:47 logstar2<br>Bass can do almost any role in music. Rhythm, chords, melody, counter-melody, etc. 

As one example, I used to be in a group where I played fretless behind a very percussive fingerstyle acoustic guitar player/singer and another guy on hand percussion. Since everything both of them did was staccato, my role was to play long, sustaining notes with a lot of vibrato and slide them around between chords to fill in the holes and provide counter-melody. Almost like what a cello would do. Or a harmony backing vocal.
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-11-15 12:28:56 TheEarthIs_Flat<br>Hey, im new to the whole music thing, can you explain what a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is and how you tend to implement them into ur songs? Thanks!
</p></li><li><p><b>tranceproduction</b> 2019-11-15 22:16:33 bonsaiaustin<br>I really liked the flow and the structure. Maybe add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, but other than that great track!
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-11-16 03:13:29 Due_Respect<br>To be a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is a melody that can either play against or with the melody. I make them to be accents to the melody in 1/4 or 1/8 notes depending on how fast your melody is. There's plenty of YouTube videos on it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-11-16 23:45:38 BigHikez<br>i’m by no means an expert, but i think it depends on the genre and the feel of the song that you want. Like, everything is about decision making honestly, so if you know you want an instrument to be the driving force of your song, you may not wanna throw reverb on it right away (at least externally) unless you’re specifically going for that spacious sound or whatever other reasoning you’ve decided important enough to add on there. i’ve found that spending too much time trying to perfect the sound of say, a kick, or really any short percussive sound is a little too tedious for the writing process—especially if you know you’re not going to drastically change the dynamic characteristics of said sound. lately for myself, i’ll start with a progression or melody to get a general direction that i want to go in, sorta tweak that sound until I get what i’m looking for (or close to it/something cool. honestly this is probably the most important part of my process because a sample, for example, can give you one idea and feeling but after maybe 5-10 minutes of trying to evoke a certain sound you accidentally stumble upon something even greater than you had first imagined) after i’m done establishing the mood with my original sound, i like to add complimenting sounds (maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>  or bassline) but sometimes (or often times depending on your taste) all you need is the drums and a track is finished (to start processing). Typically advice i’ve gotten from professionals and people who’ve been doing this far longer than I is: keep it simple. it’s so easy to overdo things nowadays and in general, but time is money. whether you’re a hobbyist or aspiring professional like myself you can’t always spend an hour trying to design the perfect sound for you. you’ve gotta be quick and snappy because sometimes you’re on other people’s time. sometimes people need STEMs that you don’t have so you have (or even remember :|) and sometimes you need to make an exclusive right on the spot. granted this may not be something you’re worried about on the hobbyist side of things: nothing starts my work day off right like starting a session two hours before work and having a foundational track out rendered and ready to listen to on my way to work lol.

The main melody is pretty good. The main thing you need to work on is sound selection which just comes with practice. I think you could've chose a better snare, it just seems jarring in this beat. I dont like the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, the sound you chose for that just sounds too harsh. The hi hats sound like they are random and dont create much rythm, I respect that you didnt just do the standard two step but that wouldve sounded better in thsi case.

I think the melody is pretty good, you need to EQ some of the high end in that melody or even pitch it down tho cos the sound of it is a bit harsh. Drums are pretty good though, the hi hat at times feels like you've just randomly chosen spots to do rolls where you should be using rolls to make a rythm if that makes sense. 

I dont like the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in, it sounds like two songs are playing at once.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-18 21:16:26 anonymous62034<br>Sure, thanks for the feedback! I think the mixing on the melody sounds pretty clean, but overall it feels like it's missing something. I know it's probably intentional, but for me the 808 feels a bit too high pitched- it might sound better either the octave down or just in a lower key. Since the beat is pretty repetitive, it might be better to switch up some of the percussion or put on a lowpass filter or something, or even switch up the 808 pattern. It's catchy, but after a while the repetition is a little too much. I do like the drum pattern, though! Overall it's pretty good, but I think you need to spice it up a bit more with maybe some panned percs, 808 variations, and/or maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>?
</p></li><li><p><b>HomeworkHelp</b> 2019-11-19 01:57:22 TastyOstrich<br>You're already focusing on lyrics, so there's that.  Words are very direct.

**Next focus on instrumentation.  Identify what instruments you can hear.**  Sometimes this is hard for non-musicians but either research or take your best guess.  Ask yourself what the instrument might represent.  For example: Trombones and other bassy instruments represent anger.  Or the horns represent airplanes in Ride of the Valkyries.

**Then talk about how the instruments are being used.**  For example, violins are extremely versatile and can convey all sorts of emotions.  Violins can be used for romance when they are being played smooth and connected, generally in a major key.  Or they can represent sadness, generally played in a minor key with long and sustained notes.

**Finally, completely focus on one section of a song that best represents the emotion.  Really dissect it.**

Like for Missing You by All Time Low, I hear piano, guitar, possibly banjo?  Sometimes I hear an addition of a bell.  The guitar is played rhythmically while the banjo is used as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the piano.  The emotion conveyed feels almost sad and nostalgic.  The style is reminiscent of being out on the road, in the country.

Idk stuff like that.  Definitely use musical terms if you've learned some in your class.  

I suggest you choose two songs that have similar instrumentation but convey different emotions.  How did the songs do that despite having the same instruments?  It's the lyrics and how the instruments were used.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-19 05:08:20 desolateflaw<br>I really like it, I think a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> using a choir vst and a slightly louder bass could've been pretty dope though
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-19 06:31:31 stick7_<br>I got you. 

Listened to a couple of your beats, here's some things I noticed (not in ALL the tracks, just some):

**[FREE FOR PROFIT] Drake x Lil Baby Type Beat - "Gone" | Rap Trap Instrumental**

- Drums are super quite/faded out for my taste. 
- The snares are pretty annoying. I can't hear the clap. The rhythm gets thrown off. 
- It gets pretty repetitive. There needs to be more switch up.
- You did a little, little bit too much with the percs/snares/hh rolls. 


**[FREE FOR PROFIT] Iann Dior x Roddy Ricch Type Beat - "Rock n Roll" | Rap Trap Instrumental**

- Again, drums are little to quiet/faded for my taste.
- Again, you're going slightly too overboard with the percs/snares rolls. In melodic beats, you want to be that shit kind of subtle. If you remove the snare rolls, it'd be perfect. 
- Apart from that, I'm really fucking with this beat. 

**Dababy x NLE Choppa Type Beat - "Bag Em Up" | Rap Trap Instrumental**

- Once again, drums quite faded. 
- Counter-melody fades out too quickly. 
- Slightly too repetitive again. 


Overall, you just need to work on not overdoing your perc/snare/hh roll game - everything in moderation. Also, you need to make your drums smack harder. Ohm and work on not being repetitive. 


Do you use loops/samples? Since that's a big indication of being repetitive. If so, you NEED to work on some music theory to add more variation to samples.
</p></li><li><p><b>Broadway</b> 2019-11-19 07:27:41 chekeymonk10<br> Everyone is in unison apart from the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. A 2 part harmony isn't that impressive.

</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-11-20 06:35:26 kayzeblaze<br>I like the chords and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> but I really feel like you can improve a lot if you use equalizers, delay and reverb on your vocals. otherwise great work buddy !! keep it up and don't give up
</p></li><li><p><b>BedroomBands</b> 2019-11-20 06:55:08 StinkbotB<br>I think it would be fun to record some drums for this, but I'm not set up to record right now, and it'll be a little bit of time before I am. If you don't find somebody in a week, I'll try to take a stab at it for you.

For feedback, I think that the end is begging for a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> instead of a 4 voice harmony stack.  But that's just my opinion.
</p></li><li><p><b>Beatmatch</b> 2019-11-20 21:54:04 VirtualDjBj42069<br>I know what you mean, I've a background in song writing,  but when writing these notes are chosen are purpose. The singers would be singing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the main melody. While two track melodies might be in the same key it doesn't mean that they will work together musically without creating tension 

So I was wondering if within mixing there are common knowledge strategies that I might might unaware of since I'm new
</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-11-21 06:32:15 SpookyJabroni<br>Mix sounds really good. Drums kinda slap and the hi hats are nice. Only thing I would critique is that I would have loved to hear another midrange element underneath the melody just to create a more full sound. I think something like a soft pad playing short chords under the melody would sound really nice. Also I think this track could really benefit from a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that compliments the original pattern but is unique by itself. Overall nice work! Really good production
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-11-21 06:49:24 amla760<br>In the drop, the sub bass/bassline needs more movement. Have it do it's own <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the main melody. This is what Calvin harris does a lot (see bassline of Feel So Close). Also the build up with the drums killed the vibe imo. It started off very nice, the arp was beautiful (Chainsmoker-esque) but then the build up came and ruined the mood totally. The drop melody is also quite nice. I dont really like the bassline at 2:54.

 Overall I like it. It has quite a bit of potential
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-21 07:02:20 stick7_<br>Layer, layer, layer.

Have a main melody &amp; have a counter-melody. 

But layer the melodies with different sounds. Then when you need to, strip away some sounds. It's the small change with the melodies and the drums that really create variation to the point where it's still rhythmic and consistent.
</p></li><li><p><b>Ska</b> 2019-11-21 21:54:49 evanparker<br>So anyone that knows this album will note that there are tons and tons of changes from the regular album version.  There are hundreds of changes, some drastic.  


Agua has more coolie talking and more claps center channel, extra percussion maybe?  Very very different EQ. almost no mids...  


Climbing lacks the horn in the beginning at all, and has a weird like <b><u>counter melody</u></b> of Vinny singing 'you've got me climbing up the wall' at the end. Some point in the beginning it's on a drum machine?  Much less squak guitar sound.  


Mr Exploita has a different mix, but it's mostly the same.  


Choose Life has no horn in the intro, and in the whoah oh oh oh oh oh part in the beginning, different mix on vocals like crazy.   It has this extra keyboard rhythm through the breaks, it sounds different.  Not even a trombone solo in the middle.  I think the bass has a lot more overdrive on it than Anna usually had.  


WHAT IN THE WORLD is going on here?!  It's like an alternate universe!  How did I never hear this before.  I need to upload the version I have in my car, and we can compare maybe.  This is so weird.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2019-11-21 22:15:06 brymuse<br>You could try writing a simple sustained <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in the right hand.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-24 14:10:38 prodalucinor<br>I think the beat is real nice, and yeah it definitely has a dark trap feel to it. I can definitely hear some underground rappers on this. I think a piano <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and shifting octaves could have helped with keeping it fresh over the duration of the beat, but otherwise it's real good. Nice mix too.

Would appreciate feedback on this!
</p></li><li><p><b>tranceproduction</b> 2019-11-24 23:26:11 titanize<br>I wanted to hear some drum fills in there, for example around 1:14. and 2:15 (maybe add a little pause after the vocal sample and the melody coming back? that's a creative choice though, so up to you) Kick, bass could use more presence in the climax, either by sidechaining a bit more or by playing with the levels of the pads and lead. Also during the main section, while the melody does sound really good, look into adding some variation, maybe by trying some vocal chops or subtle additional <b><u>counter melody</u></b> plucks after a time? It gets a little repetitive. I'd also like to hear more of the percussion during the main section, apart from the clap it all seems to get drowned out by the noise of the pads and leads. You can do this by playing with top end EQ on the percs and/or automating levels. You could take some of the super high end away from the lead pads to make space for the percussion, hats and so on to fill up.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-25 00:01:34 cutebilly33<br>Yes for sure! I thought it sounded muddy too but needed more opinions.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-25 02:36:06 YourHomicidalApe<br>Yo, this is cool. Pretty unconventional and hard. It's a really dense beat melodically and it might be hard to find a pocket to rap in, but there are definitely creative rappers out there that could do it and make something hella fire. I don't have much feedback cause you got a distinct style that you're kinda nailing. The melody in the beginning sounds weird before the drums and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> come in, maybe start it off with the countermelody too or without the gross beat effect that does that fade down thing.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-25 06:16:01 prodalucinor<br>This beat has such a sick melody and I love the 808s in it. One thing I would have maybe changed is adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> (dark sounding piano or violin maybe) after the melody distortion drop at 54 secondsish in.

Would appreciate feedback on this, especially I  terms of mixing if you have advice to give there.
</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-11-25 09:39:15 100percentswing<br>heavy thumping kick and excellent mixing. there should be some type of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> imo
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-25 13:44:01 prodalucinor<br>Unsure if you rapped or produced the beat, so I'll give feedback for both!

Beat: I really like the melody, it's simple but in a really good way as it can accommodate to a lot of different flows and drums. The melody switch at around 1:30 helps keep the beat fresh too, and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in fits the beat really well. The mix is good.

Rap: The flow fits the beat really well, and the lyrics are fire. Really good  I would've definitely made the adlibs quieter though, but they worked really well otherwise.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-25 14:14:07 prodalucinor<br>This beat is pretty unique and dope. I think the perc that you chose is too high in pitch however, and it kind of throws the drums off a little bit. The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in around 20 seconds is really dope, i would have panned it to the right to give some space in terms of the width of the track. I think the 808 needs to be a bit louder, its hard to hear it over everything else. Overall I like it a lot though, good work!

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-11-25 23:15:27 Ganzganz<br>I’ve been remaking his songs for a while now and and I’ve found he often used 2 melodies at the same time- usually some vocal chop and then some sort of synth pluck. I feel the synth pluck usually plays a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the main focus of the vocal chop but this isn’t always the case.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2019-11-26 00:56:40 Subiesauce<br>I think that whenever I play this I muddle up the dynamics in both the left and right hands, and it honestly ends up sounding pretty daft. I can't get the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or middle voice (or whatever it's actually called) to sound staccato, and instead what mostly happens is that I can't hear it at all. I'd appreciate any help!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-26 04:04:12 GGyung<br>Pretty chill man, i like the chord progression! Imo it needs some bass though, and a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Also something that fills up the high end of the spectrum. 

Let me know what you think: https://soundcloud.com/ggyung/funk-bandit
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-26 06:50:25 cutebilly33<br>The pads you hear are just a randomly thrown together omni sphere setting, using probably micotonical chords

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djQlIr1ZYt8

the drums are trap, use a very processed snare and a sprinkler hi hat.

The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the chords/ little perc thing is using a plucky chinese string instrument. you can find a vst easily. 

the bass sounds like some booming 808s with some sub bass.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-26 11:34:36 prodalucinor<br>Yo, really like the guitar and the vocal sample that comes in at 24 seconds, they work really well together. The drums and bass are nice, but I would mix the 808s, the kicks, and the snares a little higher I think. I also would have added a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, maybe just some light bells or piano to give the track a more dynamic arrangement.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-26 11:40:51 prodalucinor<br>I think this beat would definitely be better without the vocals, but others have mentioned that so I guess it's kind of unhelpful. So in terms of the beat itself, I really like the melody and the arrangement, you keep it fresh by switching drums and 808s off at times, but a melody switch or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> coluld've kept it fresher. I think a stronger hi hat pattern could have made it a bit more dynamic. I really like the beat bar the vocals though, good work!

</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-11-27 00:59:33 ChiefDisbelief<br>A LOT of people will disagree with you. Lex Luger used to make 3 beats a day. Most producers probably have hundreds of beats or at least make that a main goal. But making sure YOU enjoy it makes it more likely others will. It also doesn't help that the new wave of Soundcloud rap involves quite minimal beats that are simple to make quickly, so it gives an extra excuse to just go melody, clap for a snare, trap hats, one cymbal, same 808, same kick, that scrapey perc sound, and MAYBE a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, and done.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-27 03:39:53 JsCoRu<br>Nice beat dude, very chill mood i like it.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPLN\_1ud-zQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPLN_1ud-zQ) 

I'd really appreciate feedback on this.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-27 12:49:37 prodalucinor<br>Honestly a real fan of your beats, this shows your flexibility as a producer too, so good. The attention to detail with things like what you did at 37 seconds make your beats so dope. And the change you make to the beat at around 1:20 keeps it real fresh. Really hope you blow up one day. The melody and atmosphere of the beat really nailed a slightly melancholy vibe, and the little bell kind of <b><u>counter melody</u></b> really gave the beat a nice body. I think you used that high pitch drop FX a little much tho, and I think it was mastered a little loud. I think it got a little repetitive, but honestly that's to be expected from 90% of beats that are 3+ minutes long. Dropping the snares at points could help change it up a bit at points potentially. Wish I could give more critical feedback, but the beats honestly really good.

Where'd you get your beat tag done by the way?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPLN\_1ud-zQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPLN_1ud-zQ) 

Here's my new beat!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-27 15:24:27 prodalucinor<br>Thanks for the feedback man, really appreciate it.

Definitely some really nice ambient chords and melodies you have at the start there. I think when the hats come in they're little loud and try, I think if you had them quieter and put a little bit of reverb on it could have kept the intro a bit more fitting for the atmosphere. Really like when the drums and bass come in it's really chill. However, the kicks and the bass are quite hard to hear - I definitely think they should be louder. The <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in at around 1:40 is really fresh and keeps the beats momentum going forward. Overall really good work, I just think the mixing needs a little adjustment. Definitely one of the more unique beats I've heard.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-28 00:53:24 FoePoundMcGinnis<br>the 808 isn't to loud, I know a bunch of people who like the 808s this way. you could try adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> just to add a little something extra.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-28 01:40:44 justkevinthings<br>yeah the deeper parts were a bit tough to mix while keeping it crisp and clear. thanks though man!

for yours i dont have the best listening quality rn but it sounds like the kick is a lot louder than the rest of the beat. mixing will get better and better the more you practice but i'd try normalizing the whole beat like really listen constantly looping it to mess with the levels. try panning things like one piano more to the left and one more the right, and same with hi hats and any other percussion other than kick and snare. you can even bring up the volume of every other instrument here it sounds. i'd also try adding a non-piano instrument as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to really switch it up good work tho!!
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-11-28 03:58:57 just_faint<br>Thanks for the feedback, I’ll work for a better mix and vibe.

About your beat: I don’t think I have such a great experience to give feedbacks but I like the percussions very much, very bouncy. Personally I would alternate the principal piano melody with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to avoid repetitiveness.
You can check for “negative melody” if u don’t already know it, very useful.

🤙🏼
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-28 05:06:58 mendolla<br>Thanks bro! Love the keys, you played these? Maybe a flute as <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would kill it even tho its good already🔥
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-11-28 07:44:31 lazarous247<br>Trap music is cookie cutter nowadays. Just click them in where the rest of the clickers are clicking them in!

Or if you want to make something interesting, tune them really high, like 2 octaves above normal, come up with a cool melody, or counter-melody, and then drop them back down!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-28 10:48:27 itsjustmemo<br>pretty dope but it gets pretty boring after a while. I think the melody is a little basic. Maybe bringing in a different instrument playing a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> would be nice to switch things up.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-28 22:19:15 FoePoundMcGinnis<br>i would add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and maybe turn down the reverb on the snare a bit

</p></li><li><p><b>ableton</b> 2019-11-29 05:33:19 psystylist150<br>Scale, chord progression, melody, bassline, <b><u>counter melody</u></b> is my typical flow of fleshing things out and then anywhere from there, I don't anymore but I used to often go into the harmonic major or minor for the 2 bridge to change the mood and then back to the original portions.

*edit

I usually just use a basic beat until most the music is worked out then work on the rythm/percussion.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2019-11-29 11:36:29 spontaneouspotato<br>Hey, I was really terrible at it and I'm still not fantastic but I've had to adapt for work.

I would advise you to first learn your basic major/minor/dominant chords in every key by the circle of fifths or whatever helps you. Then learn to add a major 7 if it fits, and down the line learn the diminished and other altered chords.

Find any song you like and see if you can find the chords on ultimate guitar or wherever you can get just chords. Try to play along slowly, trying to fit the chords in with as little movement as possible by inverting some chords.

Over time you'll learn the common progressions and cadences and that'll speed reading up faster. After that's done you can experiment with adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or different kind of comping styles.

It'll also help if you know basic music theory and can recognise the chord degrees in a key (I, IV, vi, V, ii etc.)

*completely* crucial and  realistic advice you need to heed and be on 24/7/365 ASAP. 


I’m talking STRAIGHT-UP, BALD-FACE, SCHMOOZING, my dude.

Starting ASAP, look up all the music venues within a 150 miles of you. Additionally, search for non-music-centric  businesses that *regularly* advertise via their store window and/or web/social presence. 

Though start with the ones with serious web presence.  Because honestly, if you’re in virtually any kind of service/hospitality industry and don’t have a reliable web/social presence in *this* age and economy, I doubt your commitment and competence. 



This includes places like:


Cafe’s


Dive-Bars


Hotels


Massage Clinics


Art Galleries


Independent/Art House Theaters


Civic Center Auditoriums/Pavilions/Amphitheaters 


College and High School Campuses w/Dedicated Performing Arts Programs (might be the first place to look as they could have an opening for live-sound adjunct instructor or even full-time)



Coffee Shops


Smaller Casual-Fine-Dining Restaurants


Diners


Golf Clubhouses/Resorts


Casinos


VFW Halls


American Legion Posts


Churches


City Parks/Boardwalks/Amphitheater/Pavilions


Hair Salons/Aesthetic Spas

Basically, any public venue in a 25 mile radius—maybe even 50 miles, depending on your transport schedule/arrangement—that hosts regularly scheduled and advertised (in-store *and* on web/social).


Find out if any local alt-weeklies, web sites, Facebook/Instagram accounts, Twitter accounts, provide a calendar of events. You can start there for the surface level acts/venues then work your way into the underground as you go.


Create a Google/Word Doc, or some other text file that will load easily on your phone without Wi-Fi. Make a 1 Row/7 Cell table for every week of the month. In each cell create a Header for the day. Under that Day header, write the venue, the bands that are playing, start time and cover charge. Bring enough money for the cover plus 15% door-person tip, and two non or light-alcoholic beverages. 


You’ll want to sit at the bar to comfortably take in each act. You’ll also want to get to be friendly with the bartenders. 


*Do not hit on them under any circumstances.*


You’ll need both them, the money person at the door, and the head bouncer to cultivate friendly relationships that can direct you to the power brokers within each scene and clique at the venue, as well as the venues themselves.


Purchase your drinks with a card. Tip $25 ($50 if you can swing it) *on your card*. 

*Save the receipt*. Write it off on your taxes. 

Do this at *every* bar. The bands come and go. But the staff—the good ones, anyway—tend to stick around. Having them on your side will, at minimum get you treated well at the venue. 


Bands that are serious and pay attention, will start to see you for the serious mover and shaker you are going to become. *The* guy, who is known and respected in every hot spot and scene. The real in-crowd staff, can introduce you to newer bands/acts, and broaden your reach within a given scene and beyond, thus exposing you to more clients. 

Before each band plays, but *after* they set-up, make sure to introduce  yourself. 


Remember that word doc calendar you made on your phone? 


Make a folder with a doc for each band that includes their name, a clever, sincere description/feeling about their sound/songs, three songs of theirs you like best and why, and—*MOST IMPORTANTLY*—their *NAMES* and *the instruments they play*. 

In fact, make another table in their folder showing their pic, name, and instrument/gear.



So when you walk up to them before they play there’s no awkward standing around, “So, hey...um...yeah...you guys need mixing...or whatever?”


Because you’ll have done your homework, you’ll know their names, songs, style, and most recent release...you’ll also have a criticism sandwich at the 
ready: 


*”So, Drummer Name, I really love the snare texture on Song A from Album X. But kick just isn’t sitting right to give it the texture the weight it needs to sustain the emotion of the song a parts. Especially on the bridge where you do the alternating subdivision breakdown while Bassist Name comes in with the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. That’s something I can work up for you in a one week turnaround. For no charge, I’ll remix and master that one section. I promise, when you hear how much better it brings out the impact of your music, you’ll have no doubt that I’m who you need to be working with. Think it over, and afterward, we can talk about a full remix and master, as well as any future projects you have in mind.* 


Now tell each of them ‘thank you, great finally meeting, I’ll email your band account later tonight so you can send me the stems for that drum and bass breakdown remix. Excited about hearing you perform live tonight.* 


Then hand them all a business card with your name, title, services, and contact info.


*DON’T forget the card*. Because after the show, there’s no more business talk. Only positive, excited, encouraging, socializing all around. 


Now listen to them perform. Repeat the process with the next band but make sure the first  and last doesn’t see you. Watch and listen, actively and deliberately. But don’t seem too eager. They need you more than you need them.


Oh, make sure you’re dressed in appropriately for each venue that both shows you are fashion and business-competent.

Something else to boost your reach, as you add clients, find a few affordable and reliable art and promotions people on Fiverr. 

Because not only do you offer professionally-trained and highly-educated, skilled ears with a wealth of mixing-mastering services, guided by a caring, engaged, one-on-one relationship to each artist. But you’ll also offer in-house art for web, print, video, and social media outreach. This is work you will have to pay for upfront to the folks you find at Fiverr, but you’ll add a 20%-40% premium to the client’s price to recoup your up front and turn a profit.


Find an entertainment lawyer while you’re there too. You’ll need them to draw up contracts.


Do this all with your full heart, mind, and spirit. 


Day in and day out. 


Every morning you wake up, and every night you go to bed; look in the mirror and tell yourself what you are: A professionally-trained, one-stop shop for audio mixing, mastering, marketing, promotion and artistic direction. Offering a one-of-kind relationship for the artist seeking more thank just someone who knows how to use a DW. Your work serves a higher purpose.  One guided by professionalism, dictated by knowledge, powered by experienced, and—*most* importantly ——motivated by empathy. 


Or, you know...like, don’t, or whatever...See if Distrokid has some vinyl slack overrun work they can throw you. 


How the fuck should I know? 


I’m an untrained, failed singer-songwriter, trying to learn how to use the Cubasis Waves bundle to mix songs no one wi ever hear or even like if they do. 


YOU’RE the audio engineer.

Doesn’t Ableton have a Successful Marketing plug-in?

Try that first. I hear their stuff is dope.

Good luck, kid.

</p></li><li><p><b>fireemblem</b> 2019-11-30 01:05:06 Maelik<br>I'm sorry, this is going to be long. love them all, so it's hard to choose one. **I'll bold my favorites of each little category if you just wanna skim.** 

#Standard Map Themes/Battle Preparations
I think **Tearing Through Heaven** or **Corridor of the Tempest** are my favorite map themes. (Chasing Daybreak is really good too.) Tearing Through Heaven in particular because it has so much energy, the name of its self, and when it first plays! The trumpet! Then the horn! THEN BOTH AT THE SAME TIME, YOU SPOIL ME!! &gt;!It plays in the chapter where you confront Kronya, which is the first time we get a particularly high energy theme outside of a paralogue (I think before all we had was Fodlan Winds and Dwellings of the Ancient Gods in the main chapters. Byleth is on a mission to avenge their father. Plus, they literally tear through dimensions after they get trapped in the void by Solon. Plus, we unlock the full power of the SoTC and get Ruptured Heaven!!&lt; All the pieces are so well named in this OST.

**As Swift as Wind** is the best preparation theme tied with Celica's preparation theme. It's everything the Deliverance's preparation theme wanted to be and then some. (Though As Fierce as Fire is definitely up there. It really sets the mood, the first time you hear it when the war starts, it makes you go like "Oh damn, it's business now." 

#Special/Final Map &amp; Boss Themes
**Paths That Will Never Cross** has to one of the best non-final boss themes in all of FE, in my opinion. The melody with the brass feel like an "oh no, it's you! of all the people I have to fight..." It means nothing but business, and it's filled with so much anxiety, but determination. Then again, **Goodbye King of Delusion/Indomitable Will**... I love the texture the piano rolls add to the melody and you can hear the desperation in the theme. It's so dire sounding, because you know this battle can only end one way... "One of us has to die."

As for Final Map theme? It's a toss up between **God Shattering Star** and **Funeral of Flowers**. Funeral of Flowers is really gut-punchy because it's the Seiros/&gt;!Nabataen!&lt; motif (Gazing at Sirius and Guardian of Starlight), and I'm a sucker of reusing motifs like. Like, Funeral of Flowers snatched Don't Speak Her Name's wig right off. Apex of the World is really good too! Hard to choose.

#Credits
Speaking of which, the post credits/epilogue theme. (**A New Dawn**) It goes through all the motifs and themes through the game and then it hits you with the main FE theme with the piano solo... goosebumps...then the whole orchestra comes back in... tears! They always give the horns such a nice <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, ugh!
**The Staff Credits Ver. of The Edge of Dawn** hurt, but so good! Sounds like the ending to the last episode of an anime, which fits the anime intro feel of the game.

#Misc, Cutscenes, Etc.

**The Land Beloved by the Goddess**, the one that plays when Jeralt is giving exposition during the academy phase is really good! It's so calming and inspiring. 

**Recollection and Regret** is my favorite "sad" cutscene theme. It reminds me of the sad version of Smile Bomb that would play in Yu Yu Hakusho, very similar execution. 

**Fated Death/The Dream is Over** Okay, hear me out... I know the death theme is short, but &gt;!Hearing it when Jeralt dies really screwed me up...Like I don't think any other FE game used the same music like that for a scripted death as a unit death...and it made me feel...things. Jeralt was just another person like any other, and it made me feel like there still should have been something that we could of done to save him. Then I discovered the name of the track. &gt;:I!&lt;&lt;

**A Place to Rest**, the S Support theme...is so peaceful... the English Horn (I'm pretty sure it is? It could be an Oboe, it sounds a little too warm and open is playing in a lower register, but I'm a brass player so what do I know?) It's so peaceful...it really feels like you've made it to the end of a long journey. You can fall into the arms of the person you want to spend your life with and finally rest easy. The war is over... &gt;!God, I don't even want get married! I wish Jeralt could've lived. I would have loved to reunite with dad and him telling us how proud he is of us and how far we've come. This song would've been perfect for that too...!&lt;

One last thing! I was kinda like "huh, what's with the dubstep and synths in the OST?" I was kinda wary at first when the trailer dropped with The Edge of Dawn, but I ended up liking how it's used.  I can't believe it ended up being thematic relevant &gt;!With how the Agarthans are a futuristic kind of society. With the whole map theme of Shambhala being all dubstep and computer generated instruments.!&lt;
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-11-30 02:45:32 dumbass_alex<br>Thanks, i appreciate it. That's pretty good beat, but to me it seems like your bass is a little bit off, maybe some counter-melody to spice things up, and it would be nice if that part at 1:17 was a little bit longer.

I didn't find the chord sequence particularly compelling if I'm really honest - it's quite a standard sequence - and there wasn't a counter-melody or a line over the top to give a bit more interest. 

But the production is really tight, so pairing it with a more unique or novel sequence would be powerful!

Feel free to give your thoughts on this little ditty what I done recently!

</p></li><li><p><b>TechnoProduction</b> 2019-12-05 01:34:31 DocGryphon<br>I felt the same way about the chord progression. I liked it, but I'd like a key change/breakdown/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> too keep it from getting too monotonous.

I agree on the production as well. Sounded good on the monitors here in the studio.

&amp;#x200B;

Cool track man! I think the drumline is tight man really got a nice groove to it. My feedback would be to lower the vox down and maybe don't have it repeat as much as it does kinda sounds like too much is going on at once. Also look for a more natural sounding counter-melody the switch ups sounded really stocky and imo didn't fit the beat, maybe try bringing in another sample or something instead. Regardless nice work and definitely keep going!
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-12-05 18:50:37 _RayBeats_<br>ok cool so my snare is like not doing it properly. and the synth is a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> all beats need a counter emelody dont they? but i dont know man cheers for the feedback though!
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2019-12-06 17:28:07 Linvail<br>What kind of music are you playing? Some genres are more rigid than others.

Try bringing your own influences to the mix. Maybe a tasteful fill here and there or a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on the bridge. That kind of stuff. Spice things up.

Maybe play around with the rythm a bit - Leave silences, play quarter notes when the guitar churns the eigth...
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-12-08 05:20:44 CalZaw<br>Chord progression is nice. A little stagnant, but I think when you introduce part 2 of the drop, it will really make the song.

Definitely missing some mids. Not enough body.

A <b><u>counter melody</u></b> with a lead would be nice in the spots where the chord synths breathe.

I would definitely not listen to this alone in the car. But I can 100% hear this at a festival dude. This has real potential! Would love to hear the final product.

Would appreciate some feedback on my track as well!

Well mixed, that 808 is hitting hard, and you did a great job with with arrangement so the track never got stale. Someone needs to hop on and kill that shit for sure. I wasn't a huge fan of the bell type <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in around 1:05, compared to the rest of the melodic elements you had in there, that one just sounded a little bit forced/generic compared to the rest but its only there for for a few bars. All in all, amazing job dude. Keep at it.

edit: a word
</p></li><li><p><b>synthwaveproducers</b> 2019-12-10 23:13:12 CD2020<br>Love that bass sound.   


So, this is more of a sketch (which is what I think you were going for). Still, there are two things I'd consider. One, a contrasting higher element that plays a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something when your synth plays alone. You need something to engage the ear that's a little different. Two, you have two kind of similar sounds (bass and what follows the bass, another synth). I think I'd make that something different, again just for contrast. 

On the mix side of things, your drums don't quite have enough presence. Since you have so few elements, I think you want them to fill up more of the space. Maybe that's just sounds with longer tails (reverb on the snare, for example). And maybe a thicker bass drum with a good amount of character.   


Last thing, it doesn't sound really balanced at this point. Once the drums are louder maybe that'll be okay but I think you want the drums hotter and maybe the hats a little more pronounced just so there's a little more high end to attract the listener.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers.

</p></li><li><p><b>IndieMusicFeedback</b> 2019-12-13 23:45:14 SpookyJabroni<br>Really nice stuff! I really like the chord progression in the piano. Only thing that I really noticed was that the kick was a little clicky for my taste. Possibly because I'm listening on crappy speakers right now, but it also sounds like its layered with a hihat. This isn't really a critique it's more of just a personal preference type of thing, but I really like to EQ the high end out of my kicks and then side chain it pretty heavily on my main instrument tracks. Other than that, the <b><u>counter melody</u></b>/ piano solo type thing was really really cool, but I feel like it just got lost in the main piano samples. I think the easiest way to go about that would be to just pick a different instrument. If that's not possible maybe try pitching it up an octave if it can work, or just try and make it stand out with some EQ. Overall though this was really nice though, and it actually put me in a pretty good mood. BTW I just listened again on some headphones and that bass slaps. Keep it up man!
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-12-14 05:26:59 ckimb<br>There's always drum switchups you could do. There's also more creative things you can do like switching tones, keys, genres.

For simpler things, give the melody a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to fight against or be replaced by. You could also raise the melody by a 5th or even an octave to have the song reach higher.

Alternatively, you could have another instrument entirely take over the melody. Think like when you had the piano take it over, but include the big drop style drums and backing synths. You might need to find a way to make the piano or other instrument powerful enough, however.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-14 22:55:23 SaturnPaul<br>I hear the creepy vibes on this one for sure. I think I have to second what somebody else already said. It's cool, but it just feels a bit repetitive. Throw a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in there and I think you'll have a banger for sure.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-15 09:29:45 lzyv<br>honestly don't have much criticism. love the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in at 0:33. everything flowed nicely, and you kept it interesting throughout the whole thing. the beat is great man, keep it up.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-15 10:26:51 Tingzorz<br>I like the vibe, solid sound selection. if I were you, I would make the drums more punchy by compressing the sounds a bit. make sure to EQ out the sub frequencies of each layer (except the bassline), just to you can achieve a louder and cleaner master. feel free to add a counter-melody to the second half of the beat. other than that, I can't really complain, keep up the good work!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-15 20:02:15 mauriLi<br>Hey, I really liked it overall. Very happy, good flowing melody, it's definitely a solid foundation. I just have to say that the 808 goes in a complete different direction then the rest of the track. The 808 tries to create so much hype, but the track won't follow up, which makes it kind of weird in my opinion. I would really like to hear a little bit more basic smooth 808 and a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something like that. Or another way to solve this would be putting another melody on top while the hype 808 plays, which takes the rest of the song more into this direction. I hope I was able to bring my point across. Still I really liked it, keep going!
</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-12-16 02:54:06 snaug<br>I'm willing to bet the problem is in the music itself and not with your mix. 

I have this issue too a lot, and I've noticed that many times I'll eventually stumble upon some sort of counter-melody part which really brings the whole song together and makes it feel complete. Maybe it doesn't need to be a counter-melody, per se, but some sort of counterpoint, in general, I think can tie things together.
</p></li><li><p><b>musicproduction</b> 2019-12-16 15:12:03 timscarey<br>Two things that really help in addition to whats already been said.

1. Make the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> move at different times than the main melody. Kind of like call and response, but not necessarily "one then the other". Both can happen at the same time, but they mostly move at different times. 

2. Make the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> start a 5th away from the main melody (up or down). Like if the melody starts on F, have the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> start on C or Bb, this gives them thier own space to evolve without stepping on each other. 

Good luck!

</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2019-12-16 21:43:47 NoVAGuitarGuy2<br>My suggestions: 

1) Play the same chords in the same rhythym with a different voicing. e.g. if she’s playing open chords play barres, etc. 

2) Option 1 but add “fills”. Little arpeggios when there’s a vocal break to give it some character. 

3) Play a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>: something that is different from, but not conflicting with, the vocal melody. More difficult, less popular in pop and rock, but very popular in metal. 

4) Double the vocal melody. You can even back and forth between rhythm part and the vocal part to emphasize certain parts of the vocals. 

5) just add solos

Yeah I literally just half timed everything. Was losing inspiration on the original track so I just added half time to the master on a whim. I was shocked and excited by the result so I just uploaded straight to soundcloud without mastering or anything, so yeah totally agree with your comments, could defo do with some more work. Thanks for listening 😀

Just listened to your track. Really creative use of the those instruments, sound quality is decent and there's enough variation that it doesn't get too boring. I think it could sound better with a few more layers though, maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or some pads in the background. If it's designed as a beat for someone to sing/rap over then I'd say it's great, if designed as a full song then I think it would need something to break the track up a bit more and add some fullness. All in all though, I'm vibing to it 😎

Also try to change up the velocity of the notes so they don't sound too repetative and so it gives it a more natural sound, I'm sure when it's all mixed together it'll sound a whole lot better as well!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-17 05:09:40 CreauxMane<br>The vocals in the first track are sick, but theyd sound better chopped into a melody or you could leave them like they are and add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. Also the hats are too quiet imo especially with how barren the beat is. Still pretty dope sound, that bass is sick
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-12-17 07:01:20 LacedBacon<br>One way is to copy the bass notes/bottom notes of your piano chords and paste onto the 808 piano roll and cut them at the proper spots. After you make the chord progression you add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> over the top of those chords. I hope this makes sense. Look up some Brobeatz TV tutorials on youtube, he shows you how to do all that.
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2019-12-17 07:47:36 KK_Music<br>That goes hard. Drums slap but the melody never moves up or down or changes which can get a little boring. Maybe a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or transpose your melody to make it more dynamic. Fire tho
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-12-18 10:05:57 alphabeticool410<br>i mean you've got potential here, i like thelittlemelody you got going on, would definitely use a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> and some more reverb to fill up some emp\[ty space you got. Also your drum beat has no snare and no resolve. the third beat on a measure with consistent high hat rythm give people and rappers and easier way to keep track of the tempo of the beat. You could just put those changes under that melody and i think it would make a BIG difference
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-18 10:43:35 hwiwhy<br>Mumble most of your lyrics. Have your producer create an alternate/<b><u>counter melody</u></b> and then sing your lyrics to the alternate melody. Create vaguely nonsensical adlibs.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-19 06:36:14 PinheadLaura<br>I really like the beat. For feedback, I would say to add either a percussion loop or even a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to the beat.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-19 07:05:35 TheDotsOriginal<br>I really like the subtle drum switches every few bars, clean switches and transitions. I do think that it could benefit from another instrument or a counter-melody with the same guitar. Also an element I was really longing for was some type of bass. I think the beat could work really well with a lot of kinds. 808 or sub bass or synth bass or whatever. Cool track!

If you should have done anything different (in my opinion) you should have change up the melody a little in the second part of the hook. Maybe a slow <b><u>counter melody</u></b> on top of it.

But overall a very nice beat! :)

And then afterwards ask yourself what would Niles Crane do when he is being excessive or deficient in something, and then ask yourself what Niles Crane would do when he brings his best self.  Often we see his best self in the service of others, and in an applied fashion.   We see Niles best self when he gives advice to others, after they have sought him out (instead of the other way around when he clings to others, or he does not get what he wants for he is longing but never activating and taking steps to achieve his desires in an ordered way.)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;



Oh and while Niles is a 4w3, it is his brother who is the 3.  3s can be narcissistic when unhealthy, but understand 3 energy is not trying to be narcissistic.  3 energy sees the entire thing and they feel other people do not see the entire thing and accept them in their totality, thus 3s are actives to elevate their good qualities, to be active and assertive, to show off in a flamboyant manner, which distract you from the things they are afraid that you may see and they feel shame when you see that part of them.  3s want to have a resume of achievements, and they get lost in performing and being active.  It is like they are tasting of the 7 but what they are not actually tasting is the taste, they are tasting a form of rush.

4s do not have this energy constantly, but they have it from time to time and it is complimentary energy and contrasting energy.  4s want to be more reserved, to have a work where people love with all their heart and they felt spoke to when they read the fancy book the 4 performed, or the gift the 4 choose and so on.  4s are the poets of the enneagram who need to find the right sound and to breathe that song in the world for the song is speaking from the melancholy longing that is in all 4s hearts.  4s is not just about pain and identifying with pain, but also about catharsis, joy, and singing that god damn song hallelujah [leonard cohen] which is if I recall a melody that has 4 beats before repeating, and then a counter-melody that is 5 beats before repeating and thus at 20 beats they melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> add to each other, but at other stages the two melodies are conflicting and providing contrasting energies saying I see both sides simultaneously.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-24 09:37:13 spacethesun<br>youre capping if you think its not a banger, this shits hard. i love the 808 slides, the kicks and snares interlock perfectly. only thing i could really say is itd be cool if there was a bit with a higher pitched <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, but even that feedback is only a maybe, because the consistent chill vibe is a big part of this beat. good work man
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-24 10:17:37 elgad<br>Appreciate the feedback! If I start to go fast it gets a bit too muddy but on yours I like the melody but I think you could have a second or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to go w it or come in every now and then to give it some variation
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-24 10:33:29 FoePoundMcGinnis<br>Okay thanks boss, i appreciate that. Ill take that <b><u>counter melody</u></b> into consideration 🙏🏽🙏🏽
</p></li><li><p><b>LogicPro</b> 2019-12-24 11:35:41 LilFijiWater<br>Some flutter notes, 
Flute <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, 
Or just some female vocals following the root note/ chorus progression. 
Either way fire melody and nice bounce 🤘🏻🔥
</p></li><li><p><b>marchingband</b> 2019-12-26 00:03:59 CharlesTopHat<br>I actually really like tenor parts. I get to play bass parts, <b><u>counter melody</u></b> parts that no other instrument plays, and even melody sometimes. Has a lot more diverse parts than alto, though I do really miss the range
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2019-12-26 07:46:25 trey_four<br>How do you use the circle of fifths during composing? I learned what it is, but not sure what to do with it?

Also, do you have any resources for learning melody and <b><u>counter melody</u></b> theory?
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-12-27 05:06:52 alaskagames<br>add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>. the piano is nice but maybe some chords to go with it would sound dope , morphine comes with fl and would be good
</p></li><li><p><b>latvia</b> 2019-12-27 19:45:17 SANcapITY<br>Not bad - melancholic. Nice to see some <b><u>counter melody</u></b> in new music :P

I think the mastering needs work, especially given how crisp the guitar is but how muddled the voice is.

Kudos for putting yourself out there!
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-12-28 02:52:25 TheDarkReshiram<br>goony tunes is kinda repetitive, there's only two chords/root notes and little variation. You take out some of the drum patterns and bring them back but other than that it's the same melody/pattern playing. It's a good start but try adding to the chords to make a fuller sounding progression. The higher frequencies are also kinda empty, needs a more defined melody imo.

I like the melodies on Dork and how the brass complements the guitar. Overall the beat has a nice bounce to it. Turn up the drums a bit especially the hi-hats. There's some more variation here but you could still do more like change the guitar at some parts, maybe add a melody an octave up that you can switch to or that plays on the last bar before a drop. You could also add something in the low-mid range since it's empty except for the 808. Maybe a counter-melody or some chords.

Keep doing what you're doing!

Not for a rapper, not for anyone else, just a fun lil track. That in turn will help you to get your brain running and you'll probably come up with ideas for beats you'd like.  


For the "<b><u>counter melody</u></b>" honestly just try and make a full melody on one track, split the track into two tracks and delete half the notes on one and half on the other, and choose different presets/sounds. you can halftime one of the melody tracks to make it sound even nicer.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-12-28 04:15:34 Young-Links<br>I’ve felt like that plenty of times. What really helps me is trying out different scales and listening to other producers beats. Getting an inspiration. I learned the best beats i have made are the simplest ones. If u have a catchy or dark melodic melody, all u really need is some knocking drums . Make sure the 808 is interesting for the most part and add maybe a vocal chop. Usually i add some vocal chops from exhale, for a more interesting hook, or verse or bridge (depending on the song) . Another way to add a difference throughout the beat is doing filter sweeps, and low passing a section of the verse or bridge. Add drops, add risers. Usually that’ll catch someones ear . Honestly it all comes with time. I try to make at least 3-4 beats a day that all sound different. Try out different tempos and shit like that. My beats really improved when i realized that simplicity is key and that its all about the bounce. If u over think the melody too much and the <b><u>counter melody</u></b> youre prolly gonna end up with garbage, so just experiment with shit and dont over think. Just focus on bounce
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-28 06:38:03 HarmoniousNote<br>Do you all have a particular affinity for the old school? It's an interesting stylistic choice but as I listen I think it works. I like how you added in some different elements, such as the whirling <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, to keep things alive. The cadence/delivery of the vocalist was cool and adds to the beat (in non-English). Very interesting lyrical content in English. Sometimes awkward flow in places, but it's workable. Good luck with carving out your own spaces in society! You are acceptable just as you are!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-28 07:11:57 HarmoniousNote<br>Ooh, I love this. You coud potentially add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> at some points, but then again, it doesn't have to be that busy. The song already has enough movement/progression with the different sections and you don't want to crowd it too much to give the rapper not enough space. Well done!

In general, this was pretty standard in terms of beat sounds. Nothing in particular stood out for me so to take it to the next level, I'd suggest adding a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or something to bring more life and character to the sound you're going for!

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-28 21:41:37 HarmoniousNote<br>You all have a chilled out, western-esque vibe going on with the pan flutes and strings. It's nice.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-30 01:19:28 Theethanlong<br>Idk I feel that samples are used best as a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> anyway. There should be a melody and using the sample to spice up the atmosphere.
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-12-30 02:42:32 alphabeticool410<br>Your snair sounds pretty wack, I'd either pick a different snare sound or change how that one functions. Too much splash. The chords sound nice though. Make sure to add some high hats and stone rolls on those hats. If this is your first beat as it continues make sure to add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to those chords. Some kind of pluck or maybe an arpeggio. Leave yourself some head room on the volume of the channels, no reason to mix the volume so high when we can just turn it up right? Lastly go through and apply EQ2 to your effects channels and take the highs out of your bass and the lows out of your melody instruments so that everything has it's own space to shine. That should give you a pretty good sound at a beginner level
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-12-30 04:49:09 Mr_Toad27<br>That was incredible! I really like the melody, pretty spacey. Make sure you switch it up and add variations, maybe with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> or taking away some of the drums. Here’s my beat.

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-30 07:49:42 ndrksh808<br>it really depends on what you think you can do with the sample. you can either just loop the sample or chop it and re-arrange it to sth else. sometimes i'll do what /u/swootylicious said (stretch it to tempo and/or chop 1/4ths, 1/8ths etc) but other times i'll just chop randomly and stitch it together until i have a loop that fits my tempo. when chopping a sample, look for drum hits (kick, snare) or melodies/chords and play around with your chops till you get sth you like. 

from there you want to find the key so you can add more to your sample without having to worry about it sounding wrong. you can do that with many ways (tuner, spectrum analyzer, by ear) but i recommend you learn how to do it by ear. you can either add parts from another part of the audio that you sampled from or use a vst to add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>/chords etc. 

it's going to take you a while till you know what you want to do with a sample just from listening to it so don't get discouraged. mess around, try out different things and enjoy the process.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-30 14:29:14 NihilistParty<br>I think the mixing is solid, I would make the kicks and snares more defined (though that’s more based on personal taste). If you’re going for a more atmospheric/ambient sound, the current melody/chord progression works just fine, but some variation would greatly improve the beat. Although, with the right vocalist, the repetitive nature wouldn’t really be noticeable. All in all, I enjoyed it. Your drum patterns are great, and I can definitely feel the vibe you were trying to portray.

EDIT: After going back and listening again, I’d also suggest a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> to keep the listener more engaged with the beat as it goes on.
</p></li><li><p><b>outrun</b> 2019-12-30 16:54:53 ChapGod<br>Add a wavy <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, would add to the layering of the sounds. Overall, it’s sounding good!
</p></li><li><p><b>AskReddit</b> 2019-12-30 21:19:38 U_feel_Me<br>I feel your pain.  

Just a comment for people facing the same thing in the future:   

Most of the audience doesn’t know if you are improvising or not. If you know the chords you are playing over, you can memorize something you create (it can just be arpeggios or partial scales) that fits the chords.  For example, if your chords are Am Bm C G, your notes can be: 
(Am) a b c (Bm) b c d (C) c d e (G) d e g.

It may not sound great, but it will sound like music. Obviously, if you have time, you can memorize a melody or counter-melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2019-12-30 22:50:53 Selig_Audio<br>I started out in my professional music career by playing in a top 40 band (first drums, then key bass). Learning so many songs (and such a variety) taught me far more than I realized at the time. So I would recommend taking a song or two that you love, and re-creating it (reverse engineering it) as best you can. Build it from the drums up - don't worry so much about matching the exact sounds at first, try to get the parts right. This will help you understand how a track is built: when to use drum fills, when to step out with a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, what general pitch ranges are useful for each instrument, how vocal arrangements are built, etc. Since these things can be genre specific, picking songs that YOU like will help you understand the genre(s) that interest you. From there you can pick and choose which techniques you want to adopt as "yours". And as always, ask more questions (specific ones) as you go through your journey!
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-12-30 23:41:09 backpack_boogeyman<br>1. EQ each instrument to clear muddiness
2. Compress drums to keep punch
3. Balance all instruments in this order:

Kick. Snare. 808/Bass. Hats. Percs. Lead. <b><u>Counter Melody</u></b>. Support Sounds, FX

4. Use AI Mastering. 

There really is little benefit to mastering yourself anymore, especially if you are not in an optimized sound environment.

Mastering is truly a science and AI is smarter and more in tune than the human ear, especially in a sub-optimal sound environment.
</p></li><li><p><b>LofiHipHop</b> 2019-12-31 00:35:51 Afz24<br>pretty solid track tbf. Maybe another counter-melody would be nice
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2019-12-31 05:28:21 karmuti<br>I always flip the samples and sometimes add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b> by me too. Anyways thanks for ur reply man.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2019-12-31 12:15:09 codersrise<br>Love the lowfi ascetic but would have loved to see a melody switch up or <b><u>counter melody</u></b> that comes in late!!
Love the progress keep on the grind
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2019-12-31 22:23:04 alphabeticool410<br>Man this track is hot as fuck. You just need to make some minor changes and itd be perfect. 
First thing I would do is take that clean piano out of the beginning. Just start with the that flanged automation clip you got going, it's a really good intro. I like how you delay the beat with those hats though, nice touch. Next thing I would do is lower those FX. They're cool and dont sound out too of place, but fx are normally (and especially in trap and hip hop) a background noise used to add some business/ texture to the beat. Especially with your sirens, those are way too forward. All in all though, like I said this is hot. I really like those sliding (perhaps gross beat?) 808's and you mixed them really well. Your sound selection is also on point. I dont think it would hurt to add a <b><u>counter melody</u></b>, but the way it is now sounds good. 

You got discord? Would love to bounce some ideas off each other. 
I dont have much hip hop beats in here but you can take a look if you like what I make I'd be happy to do some work together. Lemme know.
