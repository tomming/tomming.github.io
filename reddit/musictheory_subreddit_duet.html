perhaps this exchange?

MOZART

 But it's new, it's entirely new. 
 It's so new, people will go mad for 
 it. For example, I have a scene in 
 the second act - it starts as a duet, 
 just a man and wife quarreling. 
 Suddenly the wife's scheming little 
 maid comes in unexpectedly - a very 
 funny situation. Duet turns into 
 trio. Then the husband's equally 
 screaming valet comes in. Trio turns 
 into quartet. Then a stupid old 
 gardener - quartet becomes quintet, 
 and so on. On and on, sextet, septet, 
 octet! How long do you think I can 
 sustain that?

 JOSEPH

 I have no idea.

 MOZART

 Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the 
 longest time such a thing could last, 
 then double it.

 JOSEPH

 Well, six or seven minutes! maybe 
 eight!

 MOZART

 Twenty, sire! How about twenty? 
 Twenty minutes of continuous music. 
 No recitatives.

 VON SWIETEN

 Mozart -

 MOZART

 (ignoring him)
 Sire, only opera can do this. In a 
 play, if more than one person speaks 
 at the same time, it's just noise. 
 No one can understand a word. But 
 with music, with music you can have 
 twenty individuals all talking at 
 once, and it's not noise - it's a 
 perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?

I'm not sure how much of the music you already have written, but I would recommend before you do any hardcore scoring, you set out seven to eight motifs for different characters, emotions, or settings. Make them concrete enough that the audience can pick up on and recognize them, but short and fluid enough that you can continually reinvent and reuse them. What's especially neat is if you have two different themes that are introduced early in the musical (perhaps two different characters, or a character and a setting) and then you tie them together / form a duet with them towards the end.

OK then, glggllggglllggggllllggggglllll - what does that mean?  It has a readily comprehensible organization but it still doesn't mean anything.  

&gt; Compare that with Finnegan's Wake, by Joyce.

Why, since its publication in 1939, has not Finnegan's Wake been followed by an extensive corpus of literary works utilizing a comparable linguistic style?  Probably because no one can be bothered to chew through screeds of self-indulgent obfuscatory piffle.  

&gt; Messaien's Harmonic idiom is far from arbitrary. Bartok's is far from arbitrary. Stravinsky's is far from arbitrary. MacMillan's is far from arbitrary. Ligeti's is far from arbitrary. Rubbra's is far from arbitrary. Simply being non-triadic does not a system arbitrary make. 

None of those are atonalists - polychromaticists perhaps.  

&gt; Sorabji's is extraordinarily carefully constructed.

And also very boring.

&gt; Opera has also been largely irrelevant to the general public for some time now. Does that mean that we should summarily dismiss it? 

But even people on the street can hum along to Nessun Dorma, the Flower Duet etc.  And as an institution opera remains somewhat commercially viable as a form of posh entertainment for corporate clients, whereas contemporary classical music could not exist at all without the artificial life support of public funding in one form or another.

For the same reason no one has been able to emulate Turangalila. It is a work of such towering excellence that any attempt to emulate it (and there have been many) pale by comparison. This is not the first time this has happened in history. Look at the dilemma faced by composers post-Beethoven's 9th. I believe we are in a similar era now.

&gt;And also very boring.

In your opinion. I believe the Opus Clavicembalisticum to be on of the finer works of the last century.

&gt;None of those are atonalists - polychromaticists perhaps.

Ligeti didn't write atonal music? Rubbra didn't write atonal music? You'd call *Transports de Joie* anything other than atonal? What is your PhD in, listening to music while deaf?

In any case, 
&gt;No, I use it with its literal meaning of non-tonal.

The reason contemporary classical music is floundering financially is because of a whole swathe of unfortunate events, beginning with the elitism of the New Viennese. Composers intentionally set themselves above listeners and told listeners they were doing so. 

It is also not actually floundering in my country. It has a small but dedicated and growing following, numbering mostly from music students and composers, but also a surprising number of members of the general public. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-08-16 03:06:07 AndrewT81<br>There are a couple pitfalls to worry about here. First off, if you've never studied classical 4 part harmony writing, I would suggest you do that. Obviously you don't need to follow it to a T in pop music, but some of the basics like avoiding parallel 5ths etc. can make the difference between something that sounds amateur and something that sounds professional.

From an orchestration point of view, I would avoid ever having the cello play the tonic of a chord. It's not here as a bass instrument, you want it in it's mid to high register where it really sings. Cello is great for countermelodies, think of it as writing a vocal duet with the cello as the lower voice. 

If you're going to record this with just one player to a part, then I would keep the violin in the lower register so that it pairs well with the cello. Violins in the high register sound amazing when you have a whole section playing together, but with just one player it's going to sound lonely and not nearly as epic as you probably hear it in your head. The lower strings on violin have great personality when played soloistically. Violin and cello in octaves (or even unison if the ranges work out) can be very beautiful and intense, but don't over-use it. Save that for the high point of the piece.

If you need to use the strings harmonically, I would suggest having them focus on the extended chord tones of your harmony (7ths and 9ths etc) instead of 3rds and 5ths. You want to use them to accent their differences from the piano-- strings have infinite sustain, so any dissonances in your harmony can stay poignant and even intensify as the chord rings. If you want a section that feels particularly fragile or vulnerable, tremolo can be extremely effective in pop music.

And as always, make sure that the piano gives room for the strings, especially cello. Strings take up a lot of bandwidth in the frequency band, so if the voice and/or piano are all playing notes in the same range as the strings, it's going to sound muddy. 

Hope this helps, and let me know if you have any further questions, I've done quite a bit of pop string arranging.

The "irreconcilable differences" boil down to the fact that he taught only 4-mallet marimba, concert snare drum, and concert tympani. When I asked if we would cover marching percussion, world percussion, drum set, etc... I was told "that's what grad programs are for". 

As for "no sense of competition" I chose some poor wording. There was no percussion community at the school with any desire to collaborate. There were four other percussion students at my school my freshman year, and only one other my sophomore year. When I would approach them asking to listen and give feedback, or asking them if they wanted to learn a duet or an ensemble piece, they explained that they didn't want to do any More work than what they already put in for lessons. 

I'm not looking to make millions of dollars. If I was, I wouldn't be banking on composition. I'm simply asking the /r/musictheory community if they have any suggestions for schools that might offer an atmosphere that would be more along the lines of my learning style, and I really appreciate the feedback I've gotten from other members of this subreddit on the issue.

I hope I cleared up the issues you had with my original post.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-11-27 06:21:04 adamup27<br>I realize you are probably going for the swing style jazz broadway, but if you are writing for an actual musical, incorporate as many styles as you can. For example, Rent, has a light intro song (Rent), a Latin tango (tango Maureen), a romantic duet (Light My Candle) a deep, sad, anthem almost (One Song Glory) etc. 
that's one thing that new musicals (especially when the composer is new) never have. They'll have the slow and the fast and the faster.

As is so often the case, I think some of the beauty in the composition goes beyond the notes and chords. Specifically, one of the things I particularly like that is not immediately apparent is that for a large part of the piece the melody is the high guitar part, and the vocals are more of a countermelody. That texture is present in the vamp section you linked to as well, making it less "melody and accompaniment" and more a duet between voice and guitar.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-11-30 10:52:02 CrownStarr<br>First off, your D should be a Db, since Eb7 is a dominant seventh. A D natural would make it an Ebmaj7(#11). The first chord *should* be an Fmaj7, though, or else your lead sheet is wrong. The difference between the two is important!

Anyway, voicing chords in jazz is a *huge*, huge topic, and to an extent, the only right answer is what you think sounds good. I can still give you some general pointers though. It also varies a lot depending on the context you're playing in: whether you're playing solo (I'm assuming you're a pianist), playing in a trio/combo, playing in a big band, playing a duet with a singer, etc. For now, we'll stick with the world of solo piano.

So, going up by thirds, the notes in Eb7(#11) are Eb, G, Bb, Db, (F), A, (C). I have the F (the 9th) and the C (the 13th) in parentheses because even though they're not explicitly named in the chord, they're pretty much free for you to use any time you want on a major or dominant 7th. That's the beauty and the curse of jazz - the rules are quite flexible.

To speak in really, really broad terms, you can think of your left hand as the "foundation" and your right hand as the "color". What I mean by that is that your left hand should be playing the notes that are most important to the chord (the root, third, seventh, and fifth, in descending order of importance), and your right hand can play the melody and some more "colorful" notes, like the 9th, 11th, and 13th, or whatever else it wants.

So, let's start with the left hand. If you're playing solo, you'll pretty much always want to have the root on the bottom. If you can reach it, 1-7-3 is a great voicing for 7th chords, so in this case that would be Eb-Db-G. Personally, I can't even reach Eb-G, much less with the Db in the middle, so I'd have to do something else. In this case, I would leave out the G for now and just play Eb-Db in my left hand. If it were higher up, like an A7 chord, I might add the third in the middle and play 1-3-7. However, an Eb-G-Db (using the second Eb below middle C) is just too muddy IMO. Try it yourself and see the difference between the two registers.

Okay, so that's the left hand. What about the right hand? Well, we need an A natural on the top, since that's the melody. We also want to get a G, so that we make sure we have the three notes necessary to an Eb7 being an Eb7 (the Eb, G, and Db). I wouldn't put it right underneath the A, because then we won't hear the melody as distinctly, so I'd choose the one a 9th below our melody A. You'll notice that putting that in the right hand gets us that LH voicing that I said was nice, 1-7-3. We're just picking up the top note in our RH. If you can do it all with your LH, more power to you. So from there, we just need to fill in from G to the A so it doesn't sound so empty. You can just do straight thirds - G, Bb, Db, F, A. You could add the 13th: G, C, Db, F, A. You could change your mind and leave out the 3rd entirely, and just play C, F, A. That'll give it a sense of being less defined, less clear about what its tonality is. In jazz, a chord without its third is called a *sus* chord (short for suspended or suspension). I personally like that sound there because of the out-of-key nature of the chord.

Let me know if you have any questions about that, I know I just threw a boatload of information at you! That's the kind of basic thought process I go through when thinking about how to voice a chord, but with a lot of extra options left out and with some of the steps explained in more detail.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-01-07 20:36:40 m3g0wnz<br>That's the question! Most people conclude that it must be a case for equal-temperament. Since it's a vocal duet, it's believed that it's very, very unlikely that singers would actually be able to sing an interval of an octave-minus-the-comma (I mean, think about it). 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-01-22 03:58:53 respighi<br>Lots of good advice here. Some other ideas:

* Take one piece and arrange it in 3, 5, 8 different ways.
* Take values for several key parameters and mix and match them at random. For instance, time signature, tempo, rhythm, instrumentation, dynamic shape, chord progression, phrase structure. For each of those categories, think of 5 or 6 possibilities. Mix and match, lock down those parameters, and write within them.
* Compose a piece based on a story, or a painting. Literally try to create a musical version of that artwork.
* Record yourself randomly improvising on your instrument for a half hour or so. Play it back and see if anything is usable.
* Try weird things. A snare drum/violin duet, a guitar/bass duet where the bass plays all the high notes, a 5/4 shuffle, a piece with only sus chords, etc.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-02-05 04:39:52 justinverlanderxxx<br>*Daydream Nation* is number one for sure. It's THE classic SY album - from start to finish there is not a single bad moment. I'm a sucker for narrative and this album tells a story and takes on the big topics of the time, a great look at the decaying American city of the latter half of the 20th century, and it's still so relevant. (Growing up in Detroit and living now in Chicago, everything on the Trilogy is so real and familiar to me.) It's the one album where Kim really nails her feminist ideologies; songs like "Kissability" are terrifying looks at objectification without being proselytizing or moralistic (which can be one of her faults). There's three songs by Lee, who I don't think has a bad song in their discography, and I think "Hey Joni" might be their best. At the beginning of that song there is more energy and power than even the most youthful and spirited rock n' roll groups can muster in their primes, and it increases ten-fold by the end of the song. It's incredibly diverse, from the hardcore dissonance of "Silver Rocket," to the amped up R.E.M. - esque riffing on "Candle" (I was in a band called Candle once. I met Steve once and he told me we should tour with Hey Joni and the Disappears. Neither of us I think knew that the song is actually called Disappearers, haha) to the musique concrete of "Providence," which is both endearing and haunting (it's a sample of a piano piece Thurston wrote as a teenager, an amplifier overheating, and their friend Mike Watt of the Minutemen asking Thurston where he left their weed). Every note on the record is intentional, yet it never seems forced and doesn't compromise their spirit and experimentation. Did I mention three Lee songs? There's three Lee songs!

*Sister,* if only because of Schizophrenia. That guitar in the beginning is damn beautiful. The album was recorded on an all tube mixing board and it shows; listen to the way everything compresses when the drums come in on "Stereo Sanctity," it's all so warm, which is a great contrast from the pure noise and pummeling of Steve's drumming. So many showcases of Thurston's knack for a damn good melody; "Schizophrenia," "Stereo Sanctity," "Tuff Gnarl," and of course "Kotton Krown," which is stupidly the only duet Thurston and Kim ever did. Also, "Master-Dik," just because.

*Sonic Nurse* because this, like *Daydream Nation,* is just meticulously crafted. "Unmade Bed" is the sign of a band that knows how to play with each other. It's not merely the result of having been a band for 20 years, it's the result of a band really understanding everyone's strengths and using them to their full extent. One of Kim's strongest records; "Pattern Recognition" kick ass and "I Love You, Golden Blue" is beautiful.

*Murray Street*, probably because "The Empty Page" was the first SY song I heard. "Karen Revisited" is one of Lee's best tracks, much better than it's predecessor from *A Thousand Leaves.* That noise during the chorus is amazing and urgent. It's Lee being poetic AND personal, something he rarely does, but he does it perfectly on this track.

*EVOL* sounds like a factory. It sounds like how Detroit looks - barren, cold, distant, rusty, strangely beautiful. I think it was recorded in a hip-hop studio. The producer had never made a rock record before, and it kind of shows because it's mixed pretty strangely. This is basically the first real Sonic Youth, their debut with Steve on drums. While their records before this are great, with Steve in the mix they finally found their direction and sound, and it really clicks for the first time. "Madonna, Sean, and Me" (or "Expressway to Yr Skull") is my anthem, a perfect statement of intent that closes the first of a perfect trilogy of albums and a string of great albums that ended more than 20 years later. 

Damn good band.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-02-21 08:53:49 keakealani<br>A couple of things just to build on what was mentioned before - occasionally, composers will use four staves when there is so much music that it would look extremely cluttered with two staves. I think it is sometimes seen as an alternative to using stem direction to indicate voicing, as well. For a famous example, this [Rachmaninoff Prelude](http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/0/02/IMSLP00333-Rachmaninoff_-_Fantasy_Pieces_2.pdf) uses four staves at the bottom of the third page of this score. You can easily see that the number of notes would make two staves unwieldy especially because it jumps registers quickly and might otherwise require a lot of odd clef changes or ledger lines which would be pretty clunky as well.

But, the one notation that may help you identify a grand staff for two hands with four staves compared to your example which is a duet for (presumably) four hands, is the bracketing at the beginning of the staff. The curly brackets indicate a grand staff, which is usually for piano, harp, or occasionally other instruments with a wide range. The "prima"/"seconda" type notation also helps indicate that it is a duet.

Finally, you may also actually encounter octave-displaced clef notation. The most common by far is the octave treble clef used in open choral scores for the tenor part (usually). It looks like a treble clef with a little 8 hanging off of the bottom, as in [this Mozart choral score](http://erato.uvt.nl/files/imglnks/usimg/9/93/IMSLP131763-WIMA.7506-Mozart_Ave_verum_KV618.pdf). 

Less frequently, octave displaced clefs may be used for other instruments - I have seen octave-down bass clefs used very infrequently for some piano works (rather than 8va notation which I think is more common), and occasionally the octave up treble clef as well (in which the 8 sits on top of the clef. I'd say that is largely a more obscure/obsolete notation in most cases, though.

And, of course, none of this is to be confused with instruments that transpose at the octave (glockenspiel, piccolo, guitar, contrabass) and instruments whose transposition range is over an octave and thus may appear to be reading an octave displaced clef - it is possible to have transposition intervals that are greater than an octave.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-03-28 06:35:12 ofwab<br>This issue has been explored in the design of accordion,  concertina and bandoneon keyboards for at least 150 years. The diversity of these keyboards is huge, from highly symmetrical, easy transposing layouts like the c and b system, chromatiphon, wicki etc to highly illogical diatonic systems with few repeating patterns across transpositions such as anglo concertina and tango bandoneon, with some compromises occupying the middle ground, such as duet concertinas.

The conclusion I have come to is that while the symmetrical systems are initially much easier to learn, they don't necessarily support a high degree of virtuosity, so there is still room for those systems that look implausible at first glance.

If the accompaniment is just an alberti bass or repeated chords like in a Mozart piano sonata, then sure. But what about, for example, the beginning of Bach's St. John Passion ([score](http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/8/8d/IMSLP00937-Bach_StJohn1.pdf), [recording](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZkQro0CLwo))? The violins and violas are clearly playing an accompanimental *role*, but their parts are independent and do follow rules of counterpoint. I think it's reasonable to say that there are 6 independent voices operating at the beginning: the flute duet, the three accompanimental string voices, and the bass. And when the chorus comes in after a few pages, each one of them is certainly an independent voice, so now we're up to 10!

I would agree that they're not quite so freely independent as the voices in a fugue running around and over each other, but I would certainly still call them "independent voices".

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-09-12 00:52:30 keakealani<br>I don't know about pop music, but this happens all the time in classical genres. Operatic arias often double or duet with the singer for cantabile arias, such as [this recording of "Musetta's Waltz" from *La Bohème*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jakJm-BS48Q), where you can hear the strings and winds doubling or embellishing much of the singer's melodies. In the Baroque tradition, vocalists were often treated as literally part of the ensemble, and it was not uncommon for them to trade duets with other instruments in the ensemble - here is [Pergolesi's *Stabat Mater*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-FKk_J91LU) where you can see the voices trading melodies with the strings in several areas. 

You're right that timbre can be a concern - and also relative dynamic level. Strings and winds tend to be easier to combine with voices just because they tend to have more similar ranges of dynamics and timbre - I've often heard that Western bowed string instruments were deliberately crafted to emulate the human voice, and I would believe it. Brass tends to be too loud to work well with solo voices unless the voice is substantially amplified (or the brass player is playing down the street). Percussive and plucked instruments tend to attack the notes differently than the voice (which is why it's somewhat inexplicable that voices are most often accompanied by piano). Sometimes those timbral variations are necessary and intentional, but they don't lend themselves well to doubling the voice, and it's relatively less common (although not completely unheard of) for there to be substantial doubling with those instruments, in my experience. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-10-17 10:07:00 banjoman63<br>Technically speaking, you're thinking of microtonal music. [The wikipedia page that B_Provisional provided](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music) does pretty good about explaining it, and [pretty standard ways of notating microtonal notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Partial_accidentals.svg). However, these methods are not the only way to notate such things.

In lots of common western music, these sorts of things aren't notated, and are simply left to the performer to do. For instance, In Blues music, you'll hear a range of notes between the minor and major third, and lots of things between the major fourth, tritone, and major fifth, that aren't exactly those notes. It's understood that a performer can take microtonal liberties to "add soul" to the music.

In traditional Indian, Turkish, or other musics, when it's transcribed into Western notation, most often the composer will add a small slur before the note, or a tilda or other squiggly above the note. They then indicate in liner notes what kind of microtonal flourish or tone each symbol means. This way, they can indicate how to perform the music more accurately without notating the piece to death.

ALSO, if you're interested in Western classical music that delves into microtonal stuff, here's some names to get you started:

* **Charles Ives.** The guy who basically started it all. His father actually raised him on quarter tone exercises (he was kind of crazy). A maverick of mavericks, he was doing this stuff way before everyone else.  As a result, not many people liked it until after he died. All-American Hero. Check out his [Piano duet, one of which is tuned a quarter tone higher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU85bUyDPWs)

* **Harry Partch** - When he started writing Microtonal music, he realized a big issue was that he couldn't get instruments to play his pieces because, well, they didn't have the proper keys and holes and bars to play it. So he made his own veritable orchestras of percussive instruments that could play his music. [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9W3ZOs6C2A)

* **Alois Haba** - Perhaps the most palatable of any quarter tone composer, this Czech pianist used quarter tones to augment and color existing chords and melodies. Many of his compositions sound just a little farther off than the pieces of his time. His, unlike Ives's pieces, are for a keyboard with three layers of keys. [Sonata for Quarter-Tone Piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7vZURdhucM) 

* **Karlheinz Stockhausen** - The vast majority of Western classical microtonal music is electronic. Electronic music was the ultimate end-all be-all to throw off the shackles of traditional western music, including the restrictive elements of rhythm, harmony, and timbre, and invent them anew. The Darmstadt school is one of the "Ivory towers" that probably set as many people off classical music as rock and roll did.

Why not notate it on a single staff, and write "duet" while it's a duet, and then "a2" when they merge back together? This kind of thing happens fairly often in my experience in concert bands.

Another option would be to create a new instrument in Sibelius that has two staves (like a piano), and do a temporary instrument switch for that passage.

I like to start my compositions and arrangements with general outlines - what I want to put and where I want to put it.  The outline doesn't necessarily have to be on staff paper; I tend to do mine on lined paper (so I can at least appear to be taking notes in class).  If you're writing your arrangement based on a particular recording, you might want to include times in your outline.

The best arrangements have the melody tossed around between the parts throughout the piece.  I always try to keep the individual parts interesting and something that particular person wouldn't loathe practicing.  Make sure the melody stands out by giving it space, keeping the melody and accompaniment in different registers.  The different registers of instruments have different characteristics.  Samuel Adler's *The Study of Orchestration* lays them out quite nicely and it well worth the price of the textbook.

You're off to a great start already.  Keep plugging away.  I hope you update us with your progress.

Starting from figured bass, the alto is the voice in a duet with the soprano, which is why it sounds unusual in a pop context, because in the pop duet the alto is merely in harmony and rarely in  counterpoint. Then I can easily imagine settings where other instruments are playing the genuine role of the alto. 

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-04-11 23:37:30 mxcollins<br>I’m borrowing some ideas from [Aristotelian substance theory] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(philosophy\)).  When I say *accidentals*, I mean the details about the music’s performance.  In contrast, *form* is the overarching musical structure.

My argument is that the introduction of dynamics into musical scores has been a mixed blessing.  While it allows composers to notate their ideas very precisely, it also weakens the unity of a piece.  

For example, [Johannes Ockeghem] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Ockeghem) carefully controls his polyphonic textures to emphasize certain portions of the text.  In his masses, he often sets the “Pleni Sunt” section of the *Sanctus* as a duet.  This creates an intimate atmosphere that contrasts with the following grand “Hosanna” for four voices.  Here, dynamics are built into the musical form itself.  He doesn’t need to notate *p* for the “Pleni Sunt” section.  The form does that for him.

We can contrast Ockeghem with Romantic composers who make lavish use of dynamic markings.  These expressive qualities are no longer a consequence of the way the music is constructed, but something added on after the fact.  Choosing to mark a particularly passage *f* or *p* is an accidental, not a formal, choice.  There is no longer a unity between overarching form and individual details. 

I hope this makes sense!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-04-12 22:35:27 mxcollins<br>&gt; I agree that dynamics would have to have been orchestrated rather than written, but I would also counter-argue that dynamics are built into the very nature of instrument range and are actually not related to form at all.

In my reply to/u/m3g0wnz (pasted below), I used Ockeghem’s masses as an example of “orchestrating” dynamics.  At least for vocal music, formal construction determines dynamics.

&gt; My argument is that the introduction of dynamics into musical scores has been a mixed blessing. While it allows composers to notate their ideas very precisely, it also weakens the unity of a piece.  For example, Johannes Ockeghem carefully controls his polyphonic textures to emphasize certain portions of the text. In his masses, he often sets the “Pleni Sunt” section of the Sanctus as a duet.

Choosing to mark a particularly passage f or p is an accidental, not a formal, choice. There is no longer a unity between overarching form and individual details.

Taking instrument range into account is a simple extension of this idea.

&gt; Furthermore, your assertion that dynamics are "accidental" is astounding... How so?

I’m using the word “accidental” in the [Aristotelian sense] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(philosophy\)).  

&gt; Holy jumping to conclusions Batman! Saying that just because dynamics are not created formally does **NOT** imply that they are added after the fact.

When I say that explicit markings make dynamics accidental, I mean that they now can become something different than what the musical form dictates.  Building dynamics into the very structure of the piece, like Ockeghem does, eliminates their accidental property and gives the work a greater unity.

I hope this makes things more clear!

Yeah, me too—and I think a lot of legit composers as well. Although you *can* find examples of parallel fourths in a duet, they're fairly rare. Pretty much the only place in the common practice where you *will* find parallel fourths regularly is in parallel 6/3 chords, where you have to have **either** parallel fourths or fifths.

Whether or not we find these key characteristics to be believable today, I do believe these characteristics were important to a good number of composers in the past. I find it surprising that no one in this discussion (or several of the past discussions on key characteristics I've seen) has mentioned Rita Steblin's book *A History of Key Characteristics in the 18th and Early 19th Centuries*. (In fact, a quick search shows that her name has never appeared anywhere on Reddit). She traces this notion from the ancient Greeks through the Middle Ages and Renaissance and focuses—as her title indicates—on the 18th and 19th centuries. She notes that one of the primary reasons many musicians opposed equal temperament—even well into the nineteenth century—was the very loss of these subtle differences between keys. Even further, I feel that the vast number of lists describing these key characteristics that were published signifies the importance of the notion. Schumann wrote and published an essay on key characteristics in his *Neue Zeitschrift für Musik*. Many scholars discuss Schubert's use of key characteristics (Ossenkop 2011, Reed 1997, Code 1995).  Wagner made frequent use of associative tonality (which is different but related). And even Beethoven was a strong advocate for key characteristics. In his biography, Schindler wrote, "One of the books in [Beethoven's] very limited personal library was Schubart's *Ideen zu einer Äesthetik der Tonkunst*," and that "Beethoven did not hesitate to declare that before setting a text he would deliberate with himself as to the most suitable key. To deny without reason the special character of the different keys was to Beethoven like denying the effect of the sun and the moon on the ebb and flow of the tides." Even further, he quotes Beethoven as having stated,

"You say it doesn't matter whether a song is in F minor, E minor, or G minor; I call that as nonsensical as saying that two times two are five. When I make Pizarro sing in harsh keys (even in G# major) when he makes his heinous accusations of Florestan to the jailer, I do it to convey the nature of this individual, which is fully revealed in his duet with Rocco. These keys give me the best colors with which to express his character."

Did every single composer believe in key characteristics? No. Did those who believed in them agree upon what its character was? No. Yet, did keys signify certain affects and moods to certain composers? Absolutely. And I seriously believe that trying to understand this can significantly impact our analysis of certain works.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-07-26 05:21:15 caffarelli<br>Well I notice you said “produce” and not compose there, and I am totally without compositional talents of any kind, but I am well studied in the methods of 18th century impresarios so I THINK I GOT THIS. 

Okay, so back in the good old days your biggest opera season of the year was Carnival, which ran from December to Lent (Feb) and you’d do two or three operas with one company of singers. Around February you’d start putting together your company for the Carnival at the end of the year. You’d fill your two or three “star” singers first, primo uomo, prima donna, and maybe a tenor. These negotiations over pay can take a while but you should aim to have them settled by June or July. Your other 3 or 4 roles can be brought in on the cheap with young or relatively unknown singers, or scraped together from locals. Your orchestra will be much smaller than a modern orchestra and local people.

In the easiest situation you’d be doing a revival opera with a set libretto and a set score already, but we’re working from scratch, so we need a librettist. We can use a local poet, or we could even use a local poet to edit up a libretto snatched from another opera house, or just re-set a Metastasio workhorse, that’s totally cool. The librettist will usually not be too expensive. If we want a composer from outside we’d negotiate him around the same time as the singers (good news though! You can pay him less than half of what you’re forking over to the castrato!) and you may have to do some fancy footwork because your singers will try to influence who you hire to compose. OR, option B here, all decent opera houses will have a “house composer” and you can make him do it. Your composer will need to do about 25 arias, all the recitative, 1 duet (optional), and 1 chorus (mandatory.) Naturally, if you’re scraping stuff from your old cantatas (Herr Handel) or from other people entirely (...Herr Handel!) the audience may or may not know, they won’t care though.  

The composer will start working on the music as soon as he gets the libretto. 18 c. opera composers usually got this shit done really quickly though, for example Handel wrote *Serse* (which has some recycled music but not that much) in *7 weeks.*  

Around November your singers will roll into town. (BTW you’re expected to arrange for their housing.) Rehearsals will begin in December, each opera usually had a week of rehearsals before the first performance. Singers at this time will be negotiating their music, either demanding rewrites to arias or replacing arias with ones they have in their collection, the infamous “suitcase aria” convention which didn’t see its bitter end until the 1920s. Sometimes singer’s contracts will have clarified “insertion” clauses on what all they can do with inserting arias, say a guaranteed 2 inserts per opera, which takes some of the pressure off the composer. 

Oh I almost forgot about sets! Your opera house should have a fair amount of basic sets you can recycle like garden, house, courtyard, city, etc., settling opera plots around basic resusable sets had started in 17th century Venice. But if you’re doing all new sets you’re going to be MAJORLY in the hole before this opera begins. Avoid this if you at all can. Costumes are a regular expense but actually less than they are now, opera singers were expected to provide basic costume things (stockings, undergarments, etc, this will be outlined in the contract) so you are primarily going to be paying for hats and specific elements. 

Your budget comes from many places. Usually you get direct support from the local ruler, sometimes also “academy” financing with a group investment from local gentry, box rental income, and then ticket income which is not much and you only get it after you’ve forked over all that cash to get the thing going. You also have some income opportunities from masked balls and gala nights (clear out the bench seats on the floor and have a dance!) and gambling in the lobby, which helps prop up your actual opera…. which is not likely to turn much of a profit. If any. You, the impresario, are financially liable for much of this also. Wheee. 

So that’s how you can put together an opera from scratch in less than a year! 

EDIT forgot to list it

18 c. tldr 

1. Hire key singers
2. Hire librettist and composer
3. Figure out what from the back room you can recycle

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-09-12 00:51:47 BRNZ42<br>Big band writing is unlike voice leading in that it is top-down. The most important line is the highest sounding note, and all of the other parts work down from there. Unlike in classical voice leading, where each part is supposed to be an interesting individual part, the goal in big band writing is to have every part blend together and sound like one giant voice. 

In classical voice leading, parallel motion, especially 5ths and 8ves is heavily discouraged. In big band writing, everything is parallel motion. The basic strategy is to come up with the top line for a part, and then to have all the horns in that section play a line with the exact same contour as the top line, only on different chord tones. The effect is that it fills out the sound by playing all of the chord tones, but because it is all parallel or oblique motion, the parts blend together and sound like one giant voice, with the highest sounding note dominating the mix. 

**So basically, writing for big band is about two things: coming up with the lines themselves. Writing the melodies and counter melodies that will make up the highest sounding voices. And then learning to harmonize the voices below the top notes.** 

----
**Writing the parts**

Coming up with the parts isn't all that tough. It can be a fun creative exercise. Just think of it like a duet, or a point/counterpoint. You have a melody assigned to one section (or to a singer or a soloist), and then you use the other horns to contrast that melody. It can be a conversation or an argument. Have fun with it. But there are a few stylistic things to be aware of:

**Hits** are short loud blasts of a just a few notes at a time. They are little interjections to the melody. They are typically syncopated, staccato, and played by the trumpets and trombones. 

**Pads** are longer notes that support the melody or soloist. They are quieter and more subdued than hits, and are usually provided by saxophones. They can be as simple as whole notes that outline the chord, or more rhythmically complex and repetitive, but usually not terribly complex.

**Counter Melodies** are also common. Usually at the ends of phrases, these little melodies are like a response to the main melody. You can think of it as a call/response, or as a standalone melody. 

Let's look for these stylistic things in the example you provided (sing sing sing):

* at 00:30 we hear the saxophone section playing the melody, while the brass provide hits.
* at 1:10 there is a clarinet solo, providing the melody. But in the background the horns are playing a repetitive pad (this is a little more rhythmically involved than typical pads, but it's an energetic song). At the ends of the phrases of his solos, the brass fill in with a little counter melody. 
* at 1:37 we have a 3-part build up. Though all 13-15 horns end up playing, there are really just 3 parts. First the trombones start with a driving line, then the trumpets add some long notes, and the saxophones provide an 8th note heavy counterpoint. This sort of section would be composed exactly like a trio from a march. It's almost fugue like. But again, we're just thinking about the top part of each section, and we will learn how to harmonize the voices below each part in a minute. 

And it just continues on like this: sometimes the saxophones have the melody and the brass provide hits. Sometiems the brass has a melody, and the saxophones provide pads or an 8th-note countermelody. Sometimes it's a 3-part thing and each section has its own line. But throughout it all, the composer, Louis Prima, was just writing individual lines 2 or 3 interacting, and then the arranger, Fletcher Henderson, harmonized those lines with some simple strategies that follow below. 

----
**Actually voicing the damn things.**

Okay, so you've written some parts, and you know what the top voice of each section is going to do, and now it's time to harmonize it to fill out the sound. This is probably more what your question was actually about. There are several voicing schemes, but they're all pretty easy. Let's say, over a C7 chord, you have the following line in the top voice:

    C Bb E

Here are some ways to harmonize that line:

**4-way closed**. This is for 4 voices (ie 4 trumpets), and is the simplest way to voice a chord. The strategy is this: treat every chord like a 7th chord, and have every voice play the next chord tone down from the one above it. So voice out in 4-way closed, that line would look like:

    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G

By starting at the top, and working your way down, you ensure that every voice ends up following the same contour as the top voice (in this case, small move down, then leap up). Every note ends up sounding like a fully-voiced dominant seventh chord, so the underlying C7 harmony is strong. It really is that simple. We don't worry about voice leading, or keeping the common tone, or avoiding parallel fifths. Everything is determined by the top voice. 

But 4-way closed has a couple of issues. One, it is very compact. If you want a bigger sound you want to spread your voices out a bit to cover more sonic range. And two, it makes it a little hard for the top line to stand out. Look at that first voicing. The top note is on a C, but right underneath it is a Bb, just a whole step away. It is nice to give the top line some breathing room, so that takes us to our next strategy:

**Drop-2**. Drop-2 is simple, and it comes from 4-way closed. All you do is take your 4-way closed voicing, and change one thing. You take the second note down from the top (the "2") and "drop" it down an octave. So in our example we take the notes of the 2nd voice (Bb G C), and make that the lowest sounding voice, leaving a little space for the top voice. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    
    Bb G  C

We've now spread our voices out a bit, so this provides a bigger sound, and we've given the top voice some breathing room. "drop-2" is the default big band voicing, and the most common one you will use and come across. It sounds great, and tends to fall into the ranges of brass sections really well. But there are more strategies. Oh so many more:

**Drop 2-4**. What if you want an even more open sound, with all of the voices spread out? Then you drop both the 2 and the 4. For this voicing, you take the 2nd line from the top, and the 4th line from the top (otherwise known as the bottom line) and drop them an octave. This can be a good way to move into the lower register of trombones or bari sax, giving a loud and big sound, while still having high notes on the top note of the voicing. Here's what it would look like on our same example:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    
    Bb G  C
    
    E  C  G

**Applying these ideas for 5 voices.** It is common to have 5 players playing a cohesive set of parst like this, especially in the saxophone section (the standard big band is 2 alto saxes, 2 tenor saxes, and 1 bari sax. 5 total). The simplest thing to do is to find a way to double the top line an octave lower. With 4-way closed, this puts the doubled-lead as the lowest voicing. This is neat, because the melody sandwiches all of the other parts. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    C  Bb E

This happens to work out well because it means that alto sax 1 and the bari sax are playing the exact same part, and octave apart. The bari sax is an octave lower than an alto, so it amounts to them reading the same music. Convenient and cool. 

For drop-2 the double lead fills the space left between the rest of the voices and where the dropped voice ends up. It looks like this:

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    E  C  G
    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C

We basically wind up with a block of 4 voices in 4-way closed, with a gap and then a melody on top of that. Cool. 

In Drop 2-4, the doubled lead ends up sandwiched in the middle of the sound: 

    C  Bb E
    
    G  E  Bb
    C  Bb E
    Bb G  C
    
    E  C  G

This is a huge sound. You have a solid block of 3 voices in the middle, and a lead voice with some breathing room on top and a bass voice with some breathing room on the bottom. It's very dramatic. I'm a fan.

After the success and impact of the G-flat love duet in Meyerbeer's *Les Huguenots*, many nineteenth-century composers imitated the key signature for their own love duets. Often the music would be in C major (or some other "more normal key") and then suddenly shift a tritone away to Gb Major into an "other-worldly realm" in which the lovers can escape from the strife of the real world. Even disregarding key associations (an area I believe can be important, but seems to be highly contentious here), the sudden modulation to a key a tritone away can be clearly heard, and the listener feels as if he or she has been transported to a new place. A very cool effect, and a great article about it.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2014-12-06 05:03:56 phalp<br>If you like this, you might like the following as well.

Another way to represent music geometrically is to assign an axis to the pitch of each voice. For example, when writing a duet we might declare the bassoon's pitch is plotted on the x axis, and the tuba's pitch is plotted on the y axis. Then each dyad the duo might play has a corresponding point (x,y). You can represent two-voiced musical passages by indicating points on an x/y plot. As notation for performers, you could give them any kind of line drawing and ask them to wander together along the paths it lays out. Or for polyphonic instruments, they could even split up and each render a point, resulting in four-voiced music.

Of course you can extend the system to three or four dimensions for three or four voices. Unless you want to build a sculpture or use a computerized score (both of which are great ideas) you'd be left with coloring the paths or something to indicate the third part. However you could play some mathematical tricks to avoid the need to depict more than two dimensions. For example, what if we don't specify absolute pitch, but instead assign the axes to relative pitches, and assign a third musician the role of leader. Paths on the chart would specify change between chord types, while the leader would freely chose the root. The two musicians following the chart would mutually determine the rate at which they progressed through chord types, from stasis (parallel motion) to the greatest speed they can muster, and the resolution at which they did it, anywhere from full glissando to diatonically.

This is all basically inspired by the analytical system in the book *A Geometry of Music*.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-01-08 21:17:19 m3g0wnz<br>From Walter Everett, *The Beatles as Musicians:* Revolver *through the* Anthology (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 59–62. The C+3-4 refers to the Norton scores of the Beatles recordings.

&gt;The Beatles were set to fly to Germany on June 23, and by the 14th they had not finished their work for the LP; McCartney told a reporter, "I'm just writing one more number, then it's finished," and Lennon said, "I've got something going; about three lines so far" (McCartney: "Have you? That's good"); both last-minute compositions would make the album.

&gt;One of McCartney's gems, "Here, There and Everywhere," is supposed to have grown from his hearing of the Beach Boys' "God Only Knows" (brand new in May 1966) at the side of the Weybridge pool, but as the composer says, "you wouldn't have known." After several takes were attempted on June 14, a remake was begun on the 16th, when most of the recording was done. First—as in "For No One" and "Good Day Sunshine"—McCartney played a duet with Starr for the basic track, this time a rhythm part on Casino with drums, accompanied at C+3 -4 and in the final two bars ("Guitar I") by Harrison's electric twelve-string. The Rickenbacker's so-called Rick-O Sound stereo capability is taken advantage of at C, the signal sent to two amps, miked separately to the Casino/drum track and to a second track; the tone pedal colors the song's final five notes. Then bass was added to a third track of Take 13; the fourth was filled with backing vocals from McCartney, Lennon, and Harrison and (beginning at C+8 but more audible a bar later) finger snaps. The bass and basic track were reduced to one track, along with a sped-up overdubbed lead vocal from McCartney, sustaining the upper line at C+9-10, all parts now heard right. This and the backing-vocal track (left-center, with reverb) and Ricky-12 "pre-echo" (left) joined a doubled lead vocal (left, descending at C+9-10) added on the 17th. The track was mixed on June 17 and 21. Although the recording process itself was complicated by the composer's slow-to-coalesce vision of the final arrangement, what with only a few Beatles working at a time, and despite its full backing harmonies, "Here, There and Everywhere" presents the sparest and most relaxed texture of the LP.

&gt;In order to indicate a few of the motivic and harmonic ideas expressed in "Here, There and Everywhere," its structure is sketched as [example 1.13](http://imgur.com/a/AUmpg). In the tonally mysterious and tempo-free introduction (A), note how the passing motion in the bass, B-B&amp;#9837;-A (0:02-0:06), imitates a similar descent in the alto register as sung by McCartney (in lead and backing lines), g^(1)-(f&amp;#9839;^(1))-f&amp;#9838;^(1) (0:01- 0:06), representing a great development from the G-G&amp;#9839;-A-B&amp;#9837; opening of "You Like Me Too Much." This song is also a masterpiece of registral relationships. One dotted slur in the graph indicates how the introductory pitches in the alto line continue to descend following a registral shift (at 0:05) that reaches over the upper voice to f&amp;#9839;^(2); this gesture will be repeated diatonically in the verse when a second alto descent, from b^1 through a^1 and g^1 (0:25-0:27), dramatically shifts up to f&amp;#9839;^2 at B+7 (0:28). McCartney recaptures this registral dialog by concluding his song with an ascending arpeggiation (D+3-4) to allow f&amp;#9839;^2 to finally resolve in the song's final note to g2. The B&amp;#9837;chord of measure 2 is the opening sonority of the bridge (C+l, 0:56), which borrows from the parallel minor for four bars. Both the boundary-embracing registral interplay and the unexpected move to E&amp;#9837; help portray the composer's "everywhere." Nowhere else does a Beatles introduction so well prepare a listener for the most striking and expressive tonal events that lie ahead.

&gt;The function of the first two verses (twice through B) is to begin with an unequivocally strong metric placement of "Here" and "There" on the situation-defining tonic but to end with some question (What is there? [Some special quality that she possesses]. . . . Who is speaking? [Some unnoticed outsider]) in a back-relating half cadence at B+8, as the phrases were structured in the "Michelle" verses. In fact, the arrival on tonic for "There" at the top of the second verse helps answer the question posed at the end of the first, by virtue of the repeated word, "there"; the unnameable "something"—also a key word in "I Want to Hold Your Hand"—exists in his relationship with her, as described in the second verse. Everything changes from certainty to question at B+5 (0:21), where "a wave of her hand" lifts the singer into unknown chromatic territory, but he finds his way back to the V7 through conventional fifth motions, III&amp;#9839;-VI-II-V .

&gt;The unexpected turn to mixture from Gminor represents both the globe-encompassing nature of "Everywhere"—places not seen even in the circle of fifthsending the verse—and the anxious "care" from which the singer is exempted; the sketch emphasizes how unfolded thirds descend sequentially at C, suggesting closeness as she is beside him.113 The opening of the bridge not only recaptures the B&amp;#9837;chord and the beginning of the fundamental line (5-4) from the introduction, but its beginning on d^2 (C+l) satisfies the need of the verse's e^2, left hanging at B+4 and B+7, to descend in register. This beautiful piece accomplished, McCartney rested his muse for five months.

I know this is likely a bit over your head but I bet you still get a lot out of it. The Example 1.13 looks funny because it's a system of analysis called Schenkerian analysis and it uses traditional notation to mean things it doesn't normally mean in printed sheet music. A very unrefined explanation is basically this: the analysis is basically a bare-bones transcription of the song showing which notes are most structurally integral to the song: unstemmed notes are least important, stemmed black notes (quarter notes and eighth notes) are next most important, and stemmed half notes are most important. Slurs and beams show important connections. If you don't get it, don't worry, Everett has a lot of other interesting things to say that don't revolve around understanding 1.13 perfectly.

For some context, Everett is definitely a Lennon guy, so it's rare for him to write something so glowing about McCartney, and I think you can feel his reservations a bit in the text!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-01-10 04:10:06 Yeargdribble<br>Is it more of a pitch or rhythm problem for you?  You can come up with strategies to fix both.  I don't tend to have that much trouble playing and singing due to pitch, but I can definitely think of some ways to work on it.  Rhythm is one that has given me trouble, especially on guitar.


For pitch, pick something to sing while playing something very simple.  Like you could play 1 3 back and forth in half notes while singing up and down major scale.  Slowly beef up the piano part by changing it to 1 3 5.  For both of these cases, your voice will line up with the piano on the way up, but will be more challenging on the way down.  Then try going the other way.  Play the same on the piano and sing the scale down then up.  Eventually try changing the the rhythm or harmonic structure of the piano part and see if you can keep the scale going.  Outline different chords in an arpeggiated fashion.  When you're comfortable with the scale, try making a vocal lick of sorts and see if you can play it over lots of patterns.  Feel free to slowly increase the complexity of one or the other as you feel comfortable.

If you've got the Ottman book (Music for Sightsinging) you can pull out some of the duet stuff and practicing playing one hand while singing (or better yet, solfeging) the other part, then switching.  Once you're at this point your not only singing and playing together by processing the ability to sightread both simultaneously with essentially different instruments.

Any time you're working on something, start with the simplest thing you can do and slowly up the ante.  If the 1 3 thing is too hard in half notes, try hole notes.  If that's still too hard go full organum and just set a single drone on the piano while singing, then switch.

If the problem is more rhythmic, you'll basically approach it the same way, just focusing more on complex rhythms.  Try doing a strong syncopated rhythm in one and a straight quarter rhythm in the other.  If you have a particularly difficult thing you're trying to put together, you may just have to slow it way down and subdivide it.  I've literally had to transcribe out vocal lines against guitar strum patterns simply to see where different beat subdivisions line up due to the complexity of both.... crazy syncopated singing against broken sixteenths all over the guitar.

Most of this stuff you can approach the same way you would playing two different things in your individual hands.  Though often people who started piano young don't remember a time when that was difficult and do it automatically so they don't really have strategies for fixing it.  You're basically just adding a 3rd hand here.  Your left hand will likely be full auto pilot, so just treat your left hand and voice as if they were working a two part invention.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-01-17 15:41:05 Yeargdribble<br>

&gt;Everything I've read from other people says, "Don't major in music theory, there's nothing you can do with it except teach." Well, I don't want to teach. I'm not even sure what I want to do. My piano instructor told me I should consider double-majoring in piano performance, he thinks I have what it takes, but I'm not sure what I'd do with a piano performance degree either other than accompany and... Teach. 

I think you've got the right of it here.  He thinks you have what it takes to do what exactly?  I have a long-standing beef with most performance degrees.  They are lies.  It's not that there's not work out there.  It's that academic programs don't seem to be willing or able to teach people how to get that work.

If you go into a non-jazz studies program for something like trumpet as a performance major, they will spend most of your time there preparing you for orchestral auditions.  Meanwhile, in the real world, most of the jobs need trumpet players with versatility.  Orchestras are not only where the least work is, but also where the highest bar is.  Most of the jobs need you to at least have your head wrapped around pop/rock/jazz stylings.  Nobody cares if you played the Fasch concerto on piccolo trumpet for your recital.  You'll never get paid to do that.  But you might get paid to take some jazzy licks in a studio, or in a theatre pit, or in any number of bands.

The same holds true for piano, but to an even more extreme extent.  Piano is an insular world of self-replicating, very limited clones.  You train classically, go to college to train more classically, then...?  Well, there aren't exactly a lot of spots in the world for classical concert pianists.... so you teach.  And what do you teach?  You teach classical only.  Maybe if you're good you teach at the college level. Maybe you perform on faculty recitals or small local venues for a pittance.  Most likely you do a lot of accompanying at a church or for other contests.  Then you tell students you think they have what it takes... to be you.  Out of ignorance (not stupidity) and discomfort, you tend to guide students away from other styles either implicitly or explicitly.

So here's the deal.  I majored in music ed.  I was taking the safe route.  Though a lot of happenstance, I have found myself performing for a living.  A little trumpet (what I majored in), but mostly piano (which I didn't touch before 18 and didn't start taking seriously until 26).  I'm a freely admitted hack, but I happen to have a skill set lacking by people with *decades* more experience than me with advanced degrees in piano performance and pedagogy.  Simply being able to comp from a chord sheet and being able to read and understand jazz chord symbols is a simple skill these people with upwards of 40 years of piano simply can't grasp, so I take their work despite my paltry skills in all other areas.

And I had to teach myself this.  I didn't learn any of this in college sadly.  College thought it was more important to talk about +6 chords and spend a whole semester on post-tonal art music than spend 2-4 weeks out of a single semester going over the very basics of jazz.

And it doesn't only hurt potential performers, but teachers who are constantly playing band and choir music full of 9ths 11ths and 13ths, but having no idea how they work, how to balance/tune the group, or what parts of the chords are most important.  Also, composers who without this knowledge essentially have a color palette that is restricted to only primary colors with no shades in between.


&gt;But I do know that this is something I'm very passionate about that I want to learn whether I can make money from it or not, and that it's not something I'm going to be able to teach myself on my own. I've tried the self-teaching thing, but I inevitably end up lost. I need specific feedback from someone who's more experienced than I am, someone I can communicate with directly - a real teacher, not a book.

I'm definitely always in the camp that says to get a private teacher despite that fact that I've had to teach myself so much on my own (not for lack of trying or willingness to pay but for lack of people able to teach me).  It's so hard to self-teach because you don't even know the questions you need to ask yourself.  If someone's not there guiding you, you can go down a pointless rabbit hole, or waste a ton of time trying to figure something out when an obvious and easier way just didn't occur to you.

&gt;Any advice or thoughts? Has anyone done something like that - studied music, but majored in something else?

So, like I said, I did study music, and despite my vitriol, my current skills are built on the foundation of skills I learned in college, but honestly, I probably had most of that foundational stuff very early on.  What I learned most from college were things that came from performing in many different types of ensembles and getting a feel how that works, how to play in different styles, how different types of ensembles carry themselves, etc.  But I'm not sure it's the same for piano majors.  They are so solitary by comparison.

I honestly feel like you could study almost anything else and get more out of music by just studying it on your own.  I love the friends I made in college (including my wife), and I love the experiences, but as for the skills that make me money now, virtually all of them were things I pursued on my own.

I'd look for a teacher that teaches in jazz or pop styles or really any style you're less comfortable with.  Be versatile.  Learn to use sound equipment and keyboards.  Explore different sounds and how to recreate classic sounds and feels.  The other important skill for making money playing is something you don't really learn in a classroom.  Just networking and being good to work with.  It's a lot about who you know, but you also have to have your skills polished so when someone sees you, you make the right impression.  Just try to be the person who doesn't have to say, "I can't do that."  

Most of my work these days is private event type stuff with a number of different groups, including duet gigs with my wife or individual horn players/singers from groups I do or have played with.  There's enough of it out there for me that I don't teach due to the nightmare it would be for my schedule, and luckily, even when things are slow, I'll admit it's nice that my wife has the normal day job so I don't have to bite my nails about the mortgage getting paid if I have a slow month.  Oh, and I basically only do covers, because people like to pay for familiar tunes played by live musicians (sometimes with interesting interpretations).

The viola begins the duet with an Eb major chord pickup. It sounds kind of odd because usually accented chord pickups introduce fast sections, yet the piece is played at a moderate speed. When the cello plays the same chord 17 seconds in, it sounds particularly odd. It sound as if they are both playing a melody on top of each other, the viola  phrase isn't complete, or the cello and viola are both playing E's but the cello is playing a quarter note and the viola is playing an eighth. Again, i don't know a lot about what i'm talking about.

Otherwise, it seems fairly playful compared to Beethoven's other chamber works.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-03-10 23:44:43 xiipaoc<br>I'm really not hearing anything odd about this.  It's a duet; it would be pretty strange if they *didn't* play contrasting parts at the same time.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-03-26 11:21:26 nmitchell076<br>Well, the fact that the second one is accompanied by a big orchestra blasting shit out Sousa style makes it pretty hard to get a melancholy sound. 

In the first version, it's a two voice duet, no other instruments. There's nothing else to focus you attention on besides the Timbre of these two voices and their interaction. And they do something interesting on that word: they collapse into unison. Where the two people were singing different notes in harmony, they suddenly come together on that word. No such effect is taking place in the orchestra one. There the melodic line of the singer is sort of standing in a fixed relationship to the orchestra. They're doing the same thing from start to finish, really. In the other version, the relationship of the voices to each other undergoes subtle transformations. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-03-26 22:24:18 monsieurjerreh<br>The switch into unison was the biggest thing for me when comparing versions. Definitely has an effect on the sound of that line.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-04-17 19:14:03 m3g0wnz<br>From Walter Everett, *Beatles as Musicians*. The C + 3 - 4 stuff refers to the rehearsal and measure numbers in the Norton Beatles scores. 

&gt;"Here, There and Everywhere" The Beatles were set to fly to Germany on June 23, and by the 14th they had not finished their work for the LP; McCartney told a reporter, "I'm just writing one more number, then it's finished," and Lennon said, "I've got something going; about three lines so far" (McCartney: "Have
you? That's good"); both last-minute compositions would make the album.

&gt;One of McCartney's gems, "Here, There and Everywhere," is supposed to have grown from his hearing of the Beach Boys' "God Only Knows" (brand new in May 1966) at the side of the Weybridge pool, but as the composer says, "you wouldn't have known."uo After several takes were attempted on June 14, a remake was begun on the 16th, when most of the recording was done.m First—as in "For No One" and "Good Day Sunshine"—McCartney played a duet with Starr for the basic track, this time a rhythm part on Casino with drums, accompanied at C + 3 - 4 and in the final two bars ("Guitar I") by Harrison's electric twelve-string. The Rickenbacker's so-called Rick-0 Sound stereo capability is taken advantage of at C, the signal sent to two amps, miked separately to the Casino/drum track and to a second track; the tone pedal colors the song's final five notes. Then bass was added to a third track of Take 13; the fourth was filled with backing vocals from McCartney, Lennon, and Harrison and (beginning at C+8 but more audible a bar later) finger snaps. The bass and basic track were reduced to one track, along with a sped-up overdubbed lead vocal from McCartney, sustaining the upper line at C+9-10, all parts now heard right. This and the backing-vocal track (left-center, with reverb) and Ricky-12 "pre-echo" (left) joined a doubled lead vocal (left, descending at C+9-10) added on the 17th. The track was mixed on June 17 and 21. Although the recording process itself was complicated by the composer's slow-to-coalesce vision of the final arrangement, what with only a few Beatles working at a time, and despite its full backing harmonies, "Here, There and Everywhere" presents the sparest and most relaxed texture of the LP.

&gt;In order to indicate a few of the motivic and harmonic ideas expressed in "Here, There and Everywhere," its structure is sketched as example 1.13. In the tonally mysterious and tempo-free introduction (A), note how the passing motion in the bass, B-B&amp;#9837;-A (0:02-0:06), imitates a similar descent in the alto register as sung by McCartney (in lead and backing lines), g^(1)-(f&amp;#9839;^(1))-f&amp;#9838;^(1) (0:01–0:06), representing a great development from the G-G&amp;#9839;-A-B&amp;#9837; opening of "You Like Me Too Much." This song is also a masterpiece of registral relationships. One dotted slur in the graph indicates how the introductory pitches in the alto line continue to descend following a registral shift (at 0:05) that reaches over the upper voice to f&amp;#9838;^(2); this gesture will be repeated diatonically in the verse when a second alto descent, from b^1 through a^1 and g^1 (0:25-0:27), dramatically shifts up to f&amp;#9838;^(2) at B+7 (0:28). McCartney recaptures this registral dialog by concluding his song with an ascending arpeggiation (D+3 -4) to allow f&amp;#9838;^2 to finally resolve in the song's final note to g^2. The B&amp;#9837; chord of measure 2 is the opening sonority of the bridge (C+l, 0:56), which borrows from the parallel minor for four bars. Both the boundary-embracing registral interplay and the unexpected move to B&amp;#9837; help portray the composer's "everywhere." Nowhere else does a Beatles introduction so well prepare a listener for the most striking and expressive tonal events that lie ahead.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-04-19 06:17:24 buriedinthyeyes<br>well the point i'm trying to make (and why i had that term in quotation marks) is that it's hard to point out a specific sound...not only because musical theatre spans more than a century of popular music influences and great composing but also because it literally depends on what part of a musical you're trying to imitate: a production number? an 11-o-clock number? a love duet?


Stereotypically? It might involve a simple but beautiful (and repeatable) melody, a full orchestra and chorus, room for a production number (perhaps a dance break, probably in swing time) and some sort of a jazz influence (with the influence decreasing the further you get from the jazz age and into the rock/pop age). if it's a love song the lovers will each get a verse and then blend in harmony, usually only towards the end. if it's a production number there will usually be a soprano or two on the high C at the end of the number, with a traditional 4 part harmony (or more) throughout. there will also be either key or time signature changes in order to make the number feel like it progresses, especially if it's a large production number or an emotionally complicated song. Actors may alternate between speaking in rhythm and singing, and there'll be lots of liberties taken with both tempo and dynamics in order to leave room for the acting. colla voce is common, as are fermatas. vocalists are encouraged to phrase dramatically (phrase so that it sounds like you're speaking) even if it interrupts the musical phrase. most of the time, the number ends bigger, louder, and fuller than it started, especially if it's a production number, but that can often be subverted. 

In terms of imitating the traditional Broadway sound, I think Springtime for Hitler is closest among your selections. Book of Mormon and South Park are more an imitation of the contemporary sound (again, much more pop than jazz). Here's Mel Brooks talking about how Springtime came about:  

&gt; "I only had eight weeks to get it all in the can, including a big production number, Springtime For Hitler. I was lucky to have John Morris as my composer. He'd never done a score before. I said, 'Look, I've written a beautiful song called Springtime For Hitler. Forget the lyrics. If you sing the lyrics, it's crazy, but if you just stay with the tune, it's a very beautiful song, all you've got to do is play variations on that. When we have a sad scene, play it sad. When we have a happy scene, play it happy.' He said, 'Well, that's a good start!'"

That's also how Les Miz became so popular -- they just repeated the same 3 or 4 melodies ad naseaum for three hours until everybody in the audience had memorized them. Not to knock on the score, it's beautiful, but the thing that makes it work is that the songs are all in service of the larger score, which is in and of itself in service to the story. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-05-22 11:16:07 Xenoceratops<br>I like to think first in terms of form. As an example, standard pop form is ABABCB (or verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus). These sections typically have these characteristics: the verse tells a story, the chorus hammers away at the moral/message/theme of the song, and the bridge is the thing that's different that adds variety to the song. The verse usually changes with each iteration, the chorus is usually static. The bridge may also be what I call "multi-phasic," meaning that it goes through numerous episodes or "phases," effectively breaking the section up into a bunch of mini sections. Little transitional sections, introductions, interludes, and codas may also be present. Take Michael Jackson's [Beat It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdxUFDoQe0).

    0:21 - The song starts. Introduction.

    0:45 - Still the introduction. The riff/hook that is used in the chorus is introduced. Excellent songwriting.

    1:00 - A (Verse)

    1:27 - B (Chorus)

    1:48 - A

    2:15 - B

    2:43 - Transition

    2:57 - C (Bridge) - Phase 1 - Vamp

    3:10 - C - Phase 2 - Guitar solo

    3:38 - B, repeat until the end.

The verse is a parallel period, by the way. I gave some advice for writing parallel periods in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/36o3h6/discussion_what_steps_to_take_in_high_school/crfuc4t).

I like it when artists stretch out the bridge section. Having three or more phases in the bridge really changes the feel of a song.

This next song is the fully expanded version of the pop form. [Khan - Driving To Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NpyVZCDv_k)

Alright, this is just the introduction right here:

    0:00 - A 

    0:12 - B 

    0:35 - A

    0:46 - C

    1:09 - D

    1:29 - Transition

    1:37 - A

    1:50 - Transition

It’s nearly two minutes long and in rondo form (ABACADAE… basically, the A section keeps coming back and is interspersed with new sections.). Here’s where the song starts proper, new letters:

    2:03 - A

    2:28 - B

    3:06 - Interlude (Guitar duet)

    3:21 - A

    3:44 - B

    4:23 - Interlude (Guitar duet)

    4:37 - C - Phase 1

    5:12 - Phase 2

    5:28 - Phase 3

    6:00 - Phase 4

    6:37 - Transition

    6:43 - Transition

    6:58 - A

    7:23 - B

    8:01 - Interlude (Guitar duet)

    8:15 - Coda

See how they’re doing that? The form is just a little different, ABABCAB, so the verse is coming back. In addition to having a huge bridge, there are little interludes in between everything and of course a huge intro and a coda to cap it off. [Intro] ABi ABi [C] t t ABi [Coda].

Thank you. I've found a duet by Rossini written in 2/6 time. It appears in the critical edition prepared by the Rossini Foundation. It is not a misprint. The editors believe it to stand for 12/16 (which actually makes sense). The thing is. The time signature can mean more than just number of note-shapes in a measure (e.g. it can refer to a dance type or have affective associations).

1.) I do think it's interesting that our experience of hunger does seem to provide a metaphorical lens through which people often talk about (and perhaps even view or experience) sex. We speak of sexual appetite, we have songs like ["hungry eyes,"](https://youtu.be/2ssCL292DQA) memes like "foodporn," and [commercials like this](https://youtu.be/dABoLDOArMA). So perhaps saying that hunger is like music is not so far off from saying sex is like music. 

2.) I think that sexuality is often a more useful lens through which to view a piece.  Consider something like the [Act 2 love duet from Tristan und Isolde](https://youtu.be/lQNcTYVlcEg?t=37m39s). Thought about as a tragically frustrated sexual experience, this minute of music makes perfect sense (even, and I think this is important, without the accompanying words). Hunger on its own is a less suggestive metaphor. And this is generally true. Viewing teleological music as sexual often produces interesting and suggestive results. And as an interpretive metaphor, I think it gets way closer to capturing what goes on than many others (though I wouldn't say it's the *best* by any means.)

3.) It does seem intuitively right that some of the things that shape my experience of sexual climax are the same as the things that shape my experience of musical climax (including elements such as dynamics, rhythmic intensity, and vocal tessitura).  I don't know if I want to go into more detail than that on a forum where some of my colleagues recognize my username...

But ultimately, I think she makes her case much better in her article "What Was Tonality," in her book *Conventional Wisdom.* Here, she interprets  the features of tonal music as reflecting the cultural ideals of the society that shaped it: the European Enlightenment.  I'll just copy her central thesis below:

&gt; The question I want to pursue in the course of this chapter is why the particular musical conventions that crystallized during this period appealed so much to musicians and audiences of the Enlightenment. What needs did they satisfy, what functions did they serve, what kinds of cultural work did they perform? I will concentrate especially on tonality, the convention that undergirds and guarantees all the others, discussing how it constructed musical analogs to such emergent ideals as rationality, individualism, progress, and centered subjectivity. Far from merely reflecting their times, these musical procedures participated actively in shaping habits of thought on which the modern era depended. They resemble strongly many of the other modes of discourse and representation that stabilized during the eighteenth century and that continue to influence us, even today.

So I think McClary convinces me that tonality is shaped around an Enlightenment conception of the world, which includes the nature and role of masculinity and femininity (which in turn includes aspects of their sexual experiences). And I think she also convinces me that the genres and pieces that tend to be more teleologically oriented do tend to reflect more masculine values then feminine ones.  For instance, the expression of feminine sensibility was most at home in interior, slow movements, as explored by Eloise Boisjoli [in a recent paper](http://www.mtmw.org/index.php/conferences/abstracts?id=174).  Likewise, it does seem like the music that we think of as being hyper-masculine - Bruckner, for instance - does appear to be the music with the greatest sense of teleological thrust.

So that is why it is convincing to me at least.  That doesn't mean I think it's airtight or cannot be critiqued, but it is enough to convince me that the perspective is interpretively useful, grounded in cultural perspectives that are definitely relevant to the music, and should at least be taken seriously.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-09-15 01:30:16 bstix<br>I don't know of any easy way. You need to know the chords to build a secondary voice. It's not very difficult, many musicians can do it on the go, but it does require an understanding of the harmonies.

If you just want to play (or have the two recorders play) something in duet, I suggest you look for canons in song books for children. Many classic childrens songs are canons. For instance "are you sleeping, brother John" or "row row your boat".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-09-15 11:53:23 xiipaoc<br>&gt; I suppose I'm really asking if creating a duet line has to be an act of composition

It does.  There's no way around it.

You can get as simple or complex with it as you want, though.  At the simplest, you can just double the melody at the third or sixth or whatever.  So when Old McDonald goes C C C G A A G, you can pair that with a third-ish above -- E E E C C C C -- or a third-ish below -- G G G E F F E.  Basically, figure out what the chord is and play either the next note in the chord or the previous note.  When you have a C in a C major chord, go up to E or down to G.  When you have a C in an F major chord, go up to F or down to A.  And so on.  Of course, you have to know which chord to use!

To get a little more complicated, you can try varying what the other note of the chord is.  So the duet might go C G E C F C B.  Note that in the previous iteration, I decided that the last G was in a C major chord.  Here, I decided that it's G major.  You need to make those decisions, which are, of course, an act of composition.

To get even more complicated, you can vary the rhythm, add ornaments, etc.  For example, that last A A G can be accompanied by F F F E.  You can even *radically* reinterpret the chords: C Bb A G# G F# F.  First chord has C and C: C major.  Second has C and Bb: C7.  Third has C and A: F major.  Fourth has G and G#: could be an E7#9 (it's actually b10, but people call it #9).  Fifth chord has A and G: A7.  Sixth chord has A and F#: D7.  Seventh chord has G and F: G7.  Obviously, these chords would need a third or fourth line to make obvious, but they at least have the benefit of a long circle of fifths sequence: E7#9 to A7 to D7 to G7.  It's plausible!  And the duet line is almost completely a descending chromatic scale.

Whatever you do, you're going to need to compose.  But composing isn't hard.  Composing something *good* is hard, yes, but composing in general is really not.

By the way, with any duet, you'll *really* want to watch out for parallel fifths and octaves.  Avoid that shit.  And jumping to dissonances -- as well as not resolving them properly -- will also sound terrible.  Don't do those things!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-11-10 01:33:11 mypetlion3<br>Other responders have given you a bit of a guide, but I want to just point out how big of a question you're asking. Choosing the right instrument combinations is a *huge* question. If you went to university for composition, you'd spend a significant chunk of your time there learning about this topic. Composers have become famous for their innovative ways of doing just what you're asking. 

The subject is called either "arranging" or "orchestration", depending on exactly what you're doing.

Now, don't get me wrong. The last thing I would want is for you to become intimidated or discouraged by the task of learning this stuff. In fact, it's great that you've decided to get started on it. Just want you to know that it is a big big subject, and it's OK for you to not know everything, or for you to stumble on it for a while.

As with many things, it's always best to just practice and experiment. Try writing a simple melody with your favorite instrument (just eight to sixteen bars, doesn't have to be a full piece yet) and try different combinations of instruments to accompany it. Watch out for things the pitch ranges of the instruments (Do they overlap too much, or not enough? What do your harmonizations sound like when they have to go low enough for your needs? Or high enough?) the dynamic ranges (Do your background instruments dominate the sound, and make it hard to hear the lead part? You wouldn't want four trumpets behind a piccolo for example, because then nobody could hear the piccolo) and the timbres (This basically comes down to taste, and fiddling around to make things work. Do you want the melody to blend with the background, like with a string quartet? Or stand out a bit like with a violin sonata? Or completely disparate like with a duet for tuba and harp?).

Just practice and experiment as much as you can, and don't get discouraged. It'll be a lifelong goal to get good at something like this.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-11-10 02:39:34 Vaintiquity<br>So y'all are telling me that a saxophone duet has no chords in it?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-11-17 08:05:45 nmitchell076<br>&gt;The F# (or 11th element (if I counted right) was not in common usage at least until the late romantic period and more popular as jazz musicians.  

Is that true? You see scale degree #4 all the time in music. For instance in [this Vivaldi concerto](https://youtu.be/FxDvRRzVPd8), specifically, the movement starting at 2:12. Or in [this duet by Pergolesi](https://youtu.be/DyHewYbHWkA) (the passage at 0:32)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-12-09 22:31:20 joulesisenergy<br>I mean, yeah why not. Anybody can do anything. And people in the same section, 99% of the time, are playing the same part.

You'll find in scores though that when pieces are orchestrated they aren't orchestrated into your standard SATB choral set-up, simply because orchestras aren't choirs. Depending on who you decide to orchestrate for, let's say strings only, the cellos and string basses may take notes lower than a bass voice is comfortable taking, and a violin may take notes high than a violin is comfortable taking. And there may be more than 4 distinct notes in any given chord/verticality to account for the wider spread, or the fact that you have more than four distinct instruments on stage when you have a full orchestra. Remember that when you orchestrate, you are adapting a piece for a group of people that have different capabilities than the group of people the piece was originally for. So the chords will be voiced different, texture might change, secondary parts may be added, etc.

I suggest studying pieces that have been composed for one instrument/group of instruments (usually piano) and orchestrated for a different group of instruments. Here are some famous ones, all early 20th century French/Russian because that is the best music:

1. Maurice Ravel's [Ma mère l'oye suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL2fjpoS3Kw), originally written as a piano duet for the Godebski children, the daughters of two of Ravel's patrons, and then later [orchestrated by the composer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3rir1bWTyI) Ravel had a wonderful mind for orchestration, creating precise analogs to the sounds of the piano in the orchestra while at the same time creating an entirely new piece using the expanded tone palette of the orchestra. The last movement, Le garden féerique, is particularly stunning in its transition, and does a little bit of what i think you're aiming to do, which is use a chorale-like texture in an instrumental setting (right at the beginning with the strings). But the parts fit well on the instruments, and this texture eventually expands into what is eventually the grand conclusion.

2. Erik Satie's [Trois Gymnopédies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WNCBPdetG4), any one of which you will find as the first track of any "soothing" YouTube playlist. Claude Debussy took the [first and the third Gymnopédies and orchestrated them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVQCo3jTNrw) (The second he thought was not suited for orchestration.) Lots of added parts not in the original piano piece, including the harp arpeggios in the second of the two of the orchestration*, creating a related but different mood than the original piano piece. The piano piece is very introverted, this one seems very otherworldly.

3. Modest Mussorgsky's [Pictures at an Exhibition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8z1_A-Zlbw), everyone's first introduction to odd meter (unless it was [Take Five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs)) and mixed meter (unless it was [Blue Rondo a la Turk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAlVasHbipo)).** [Orchestrated by Ravel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSumsdfyiv8) because the French and the Russians were bros for life. I love how the opening theme is initially interpreted as a brass fanfare, then is orchestrated differently through each of the Promenades, and then the whole orchestra gets to play when it shows up in the The Great Gate of Kiev, the final movement.

All of the sheet music for these pieces should be available on IMSLP. Above all, remember that orchestration is not just assigning parts in a piece to a different instrument group. Don't just give the violas the alto part and make them pretend they are singers, because violas are bad singers. Give the violas a viola part. Give the trumpets a trumpet part. Give the orchestra an orchestral piece. Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's. Don't give the orchestra a choir piece.

\* Debussy, oddly, called the third Gymnopédie the first and vice versa, so that the first piece in the orchestration is the first Gymnopédie/actually the third, and the second piece in the orchestration is the third Gymnopédie/actually the first. I'm gonna blame the editors for that one.

** R.I.P. Dave Brubeck. Time Out was a really friggin good album.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-12-20 20:54:28 crabapplesteam<br>There is some good advice here, but the one thing you need is a concept.. everything else comes from there.  

Say you wanted the song to sound like mating whales, right? Weird. How do you get a duet of high pitched sinusoidal type waves - maybe two theramins or guitars with slides.. who knows. Or maybe you're interested in politics - maybe you could write a pro/anti gun work based around types of sounds related to guns. Anyway, start with an idea, and then let that fill out the work rather than focusing on being weird.

And yea, bong rips usually help.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-12-21 15:40:18 threwitallawayforyou<br>Oh I loved my writing assignment in my theory class!

You have 2 options. I'm assuming you're rolling with the "Chords -&gt; Melody" one, instead of the "Melody -&gt; Chords" one, but both are technically valid.

What you're going to want to do is follow the charts provided elsewhere in the thread to create a simple chord progression. This is totally up to you. The one I wrote (a piano duet) started out with a fairly simple I vii^o V V7 I progression (I don't have it in front of me so I can't tell if it actually has a vii^o in it...but it's a valid progression.)

Once you've done that, tinker with the melody a little. My advice would be to stick with quarter and eighth notes and follow the movement rules you learned in class. Because I am a classically trained pianist, and my duet partner was, too, I felt comfortable playing with styles.

The main mistake people make in songwriting (and any kind of writing, really) is that they feel like the song (or story) always has to move forward into something different. They also want to show off their most advanced techniques without remembering fundamentals. A story that doesn't have the same main character, the same setting, or even the same plot is confusing and weird!

My advice:

1. CTRL+C, CTRL+V will keep your song consistent. Unless you use repeat bars. I messed with the song in subtle ways to keep it fresh, but a few short sections that are repeated (but end differently) will work just as well.

2. Make sure your transitions are good. Bad transitions will ruin an otherwise amazing piece. The song should feel like 1 song all the way through, and any stylistic changes you make need to be *part of the song*, not just another mini-song within the song. For example, I dropped a waltz in mine that had the exact same melody at the start, but deviated heavily towards the end before collapsing back into the rapid fire original style.

3. I am a great pianist. My duet partner is a great pianist. **Neither of us noticed around 10 impossible-to-play notes from the score until we went to play them.** REVIEW DAT SHIT.

You were asking only about progressions, but if you follow K.I.S.S. you'll be fine. It's the "totally lost" part I figured I'd help with.

You will only need a good 2 or 3 progressions per song. Any more, and you'll lose your audience. This obviously doesn't count deviations or surprises included in the song, such as I V vi V I instead of just I V I. It's not so hard to build those progressions from the charts provided, such as [this one.](https://i.imgur.com/dNIcwE1.jpg)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2015-12-22 22:54:47 nmitchell076<br>Not unaccompanied, but this duet is nice and in the same style as some of your other ones. https://youtu.be/jj0GUm3T6OU

I'm thinking the Stanley Brothers might have this kind of thing, let me poke around a bit. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-12 11:00:01 goobybooby<br>I'm refering specifically to melodies in this case. Chords, to me, are unimportant; they are more of a tool used to create affect (isn't everything though?) If your music benefits from the use and manipulation of chords, then use them. When I say complexity or tricks, I mean using an unexpected-but-fitting rhythmic, melodic, or even harmonic element that perhaps comes as quickly as it goes. For example, the leaps in "Sweater Weather" or "Chandelier" are excellent and well-placed melodic tricks because they are unexpected, moving away from the precedent set by the rest of the song, but they don't create another theme from which the writer works. They are part of the phrase, although they contrast the rest of the line. They create just enough tension that is quickly released, which is really what the entirety of Western music comes down to until you begin dealing with the genius nutbags like Ferneyhough or Cage or Penderecki. Or to move away from popular music examples, look at the Beethoven Obligato duet for viola and cello. None of the rhythms are especially complex, and the parts do require some technical mastery, but overall they're nothing especially remarkable. But Beethoven knows right where to put the little hiccups in the flow of the melody in order to maintain interest. I would argue that Debussy, on the other hand, relies more on rhythmic manipulation to maintain interest in his melodies. His harmonies are also a huge factor in his music, and they serve the melody well, if not to create several of them. However, his top-tier melodies rely most on rhythm. In the first Arabesque, the notes in the 3 over 2 hemiola would do very little if it were stacked into a neat 2 over 2 or 4 over 2 or what have you. Claire de Lune, if reduced to quarter notes, becomes pretty but boring. None of his tricks are over done, though. Dvorak's American Quartet is a good example of a piece that adequately uses both rhythm and melody between all its parts to keep a constant grasp of the audience. Looking at the score, it becomes obvious how little Dvorak left to chance, and it's pretty easy to see where his tricks are and where he decided to keep it simple.

No, you should not add a bunch of notes between your existing notes if they're not going to do anything, and if you must then do so sparingly and purposefully. You don't need insane harmonic rhythm, ESPECIALLY if you want to focus on melody. Extra chords can actually take away from the melody pretty easily and are usually an end to their own means - again, look at the Arabesque. When harmonic rhythm is slow, the melody shines. When it's fast, there is more focus on the chords themselves acting as a melodic unit.

Making music is like making food. Don't add so many spices that the dish base is covered up completely, but don't make you food completely bland, either. Keep it stupid, simple.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-01-20 20:44:36 CubicZircon<br>First, not all ostinato basses are technically passacaglias, even though the definition of a passacaglia is very fluid (short summary: [16th century passacaglia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yajjaFjnm-I)  is a fixed motif, always the same; [17th century passacaglia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJDUugxsiNM) is any ostinato bass/ostinato harmony in a minor mode, in opposition to the chaconne; [18th century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie52xH8V2L4) and [later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZGWB93-mmI) passacaglia is more or less any ostinato bass titled “passacaglia”). Moreover, often the passacaglia can be an ostinato *harmony* as opposed to an ostinato *bass*.

For another example, note that Pachelbel's canon, despite its ostinato bass, is not a passacaglia: passacaglias are often written in more of a “theme and variations” spirit (and very often, those variations come by pairs).

You can always look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxyNxRMaBYw&amp;list=PLFD_xj2obDhePiCy9lo8U8hUn_227VT42) for a playlist of passacaglias/chaconnes I made a few weeks ago. The standard « violin duet » passacaglia would be a [transcription](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ut2jbALbNc) of a Händel keyboard suite (HWV 432); the original does have a bass, the transcription manages with the viola (and again, this passacaglia has an obvious repeated harmony, but no ostinato bass).

However, there are some « true » bass-less moments in a few passacaglias/chaconnnes (for example the [passacaglia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEkgNio5zVg) from Lully's *Armide* opera; during that passage, the viola acts as a bass - the effect is a change of texture, similar to the « trio » section of a scherzo).

Instead, I will shamelessly plug my own project, [Potmos Hetoimos](http://potmoshetoimos.bandcamp.com). I try very explicitly to be influenced by bands with non-typical musical ideas and to reflect that in how I write material. Just looking at "The Paragon Trisagion", here are some things you may find interesting:

* "Light Wells" is primarily in 4/4, but shifts to 11/4 in the bridge before the middle atmospheric section (also exemplifying the heavy-light-heavy structure I mentioned).
* "Synthetic Eclipse" is in 4/4 until halfway through when it changes tempo AND time sig to 7/4. It also has a weird tonal palette, probably some kind of octatonic C# variant (I'll be honest, I went by feeling on this one so I wasn't beholden to a specific scale). 
* "Respledence" is a little electronic interlude in 5/4. 
* "Amethysts" has a bridge in 25/4. 
* "Fear and Bright" is in the key of E Lydian. 
* "Queen of the Fire" uses 7/4, 5/4, and 4/4. 
* "Heliamartia" uses 7/4, 4/4, and 9/4 (including all at the same time in the outro), and is primarily in some kind of...D Lydian Minor but with various out-of-key elements. 
* "Adamah, Anima" starts in 7/4, then shifts to 21/4 (or 21/8?) in the second half with funk bass and a synth solo. 
* "Blue Agave Prism" is some kind of weird R&amp;B thing primarily in 17/16 but also shifting to 16/16 and 18/16.
* "Shadetree" uses 11/8, 10/8 and 12/8.
* "Nostalgia Nausea" uses 15/4 in the outro.
* "Lamppost" is a drum duet in 13/8.
* Lastly, "Wayward Stars" (basically an album unto itself) uses at least 15/8, 14/8, 12/8, 4/4, 7/4, 3/4, 13/8, 15/4, 5/4, 12/4, 10/8, 9/4, and 6/4 and changes tempo and key more times than I can count. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-03-26 06:52:50 the-postminimalist<br>Well, I'm doing my undergrad at McGill, so I'll just say how McGill does the program.

We still need to take most of the same theory courses as everyone else (that is, the theory courses in the actual theory department), but instead of Theory and Analysis 3, we take Tonal Composition 1, which covers the same material, but through the course we have two or three projects- theme and variations, sonata form movement for piano and a string instrument, and maybe a third thing, idk, we're still working on the sonata.

We also need to take all the musicianship and keyboard proficiency courses, and music history and all that shabang. Then we have our composition courses. In our first year, we take a group class with all the other first-year composition students (and if there are others who are taking it as an elective)

In that two-semester-long class, we started with some small projects in the first semester (flute solo miniature, modal piano miniature, ~5min long piano piece based around an atonal cell of our choice) and in the second semester (which is now) we do two bigger projects, both around 5 minutes long. The first for a duet of our choice, and the second for a trio/quartet/quintet of our choice. Preferrably different instruments, but I chose 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, and oboe for my final project and he was okay with it. Keep in mind, that this introductory course may feel very restricting, because you will be forced out of your boundries and perhapse not encouraged to do your own style if you're not getting as much out of it as you could from this course.

Then for the next two years, you have private lessons with the prof of your choice, where you can composer whatever the fuck you want. Except it's a little unencouraged to write romatic music, or anything older than that, without having some kind of modern twist to it. And that doesn't mean atonal. Tonal is 100% fine. Tonality is plentiful in 21st century music.

It is very time consuming, though. Add a performance program to do a double major, and you won't have any free time to relax, have a social life, or to sleep. But some managed it, like [this guy](https://soundcloud.com/colinfrank-1/heteromerous-harmony-and-noise-by-colin-frank) who recently graduated from my school.

Also, it seems as though most composition students who come into the program end up wanting to continue with graduate studies. So there's some evidence of enjoyment there.

Sorry, this comment was way too long lol

TL;DR: It's fun. If you like to compose, you should consider it. Talk to the comp profs at your university, or the university you're planning on applying to.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-04-10 00:27:47 sir_earl<br>Sorry, had to post without finishing because I thought I'd be busy for a while. Not not detracting from the song. Detracting from anything else. Like what he plays doesn't try to steal the spotlight from the guitars or the singing and stuff like that. What Dave does is basically the rock version of comping in jazz.  
  
To continue using No One Knows as our example, Dave really shows off that intelligent drumming in the general shaping of his phrases. The verses are simple, but there is a build up to the chorus. The chorus is where things really get cool. It seems like the drums start dominating the mix, but what really happens is that the drums and the guitars actually trade off dominating the rhythm of chorus and what Dave does here is pretty fun. Each time he takes lead of the rhythm, he plays a different phrase. They all have accents on the beats but each phrase has a different feel. However, he goes back to the basic beat when the guitars are doing the (swung or triplet?) chords.  
  
Further into it during the breakdown and guitar solo, you see some more comping. He does this really neat thing with the cymbals here. I think its really more neat due to the relationship/conversation between the drummer and the guitarist during the solo. You'll notice Dave only crashes once at the beginning of the solo, then proceeds to build up to a ride-crash-ride hit right as Josh Homme does this sequence of three repeated notes.

If anything, one of the things it *is* known for is its creative manipulation of musical phrasing in the service of dramatization, and sometimes even of actual 'word-painting'. (Opera being perhaps the main source of the sort of 'musical drama' we see in late-classical-style instrumental music, and even later in romantic music.)  Pick just about any famous aria, duet, finale etc. from 18th-century classical operas and you might find something like this going on. On the face of it, not *that* different from your earlier description of 21st-century rap.

If a two note interval would be occurring at the same time one or neither of them could be the rood. IF a chord were implied by two intervals (or more) then then one of them could be a root of an implied chord. So in the proper context, intervals can have one of them as a root. 

Power chords are sometimes just a fifth. If you are playing in a genre like heavy metal and you rattle off a C and G with the C on the bottom the C would most likely be the root of the C chord. In a similar context, a C above an E could imply that the C is the root of a chord if the interval performed as a C chord would perform it it were there. You can write a two voice melody that would be all intervals and no triads and each one would imply a root of a chord that may be played or not as an accompaniment. There would be implied roots through out the entire duet. 

Roots are defined in most contexts as the lowest note of three or more notes that can be arranged in 3rds. The notes of B D F G  played simultaneously in any order vertically can be reduced to the G B D F arrangements of thirds and this would in most instances be called a G7 chord. Also, a B D could be considered a G chord if it acted like a G chord would in context. 

There are several very good links in the side bar that will help you to get an understanding of how that all fits together.

&gt;&gt;Does anyone really want "extra punch/piercing/volume" from a piccolo?

Yes, sometimes this can be a valuable scoring technique. High impact moments or times in which you want a soaring woodwind line (say, film scoring etc.). Let's also be clear that piccolos are not inherently intolerable instruments. They can sound as beautiful as a flute, or can provide a sonorous chirping effect that no other instruments can. They're not inherently "piercing," although their upper range does definitely cut through an ensemble. An E flat clarinet is similar in that regard. In the low register, it's warm and blends excellently with the clarinet section. In the high register, it is essentially the piccolo of the clarinet section. It doesn't cut through the ensemble in quite the same way the piccolo does, so it's not quite like having two piccolos. In my experience playing E flat clarinet, it's more akin to thickening the timbre of the picc rather than making it shrill or obnoxious (assuming a professional is playing it... a bad E flat clarinetist is at least as dangerous as a bad piccoloist).

&gt;Add the oboes or clarinets to the flutes if the flutes sound too thin. Consider doubling these in octaves. Harmony can serve a similar purpose and provide a different timbre than exact doubling.
&gt;&gt;Writing flutes and clarinets/oboes together definitely brings the flutes closer to the sound of the reed instruments. I'd think unison is the best bet. Octave doubling is an effect all its own, and shouldn't be used without purpose. However, if done, doubling should occur over the highest voice or under the lowest voice.

I'll agree that octave doubling shouldn't be done without purpose. That said, *nothing* should be scored without purpose. Scoring flutes in unison with clarinets or oboes, in octaves above, in octaves below, in harmony... Each one will give a different effect, and each has its own purpose.

&gt;Clarinets and violins or violas can sound almost identical if scored creatively. They blend very easily.
&gt;&gt;In my experience, clarinet gets masked by strings if they're in the same register. You're the clarinetist, though. What's your take?

Good question. Yes, very often strings will completely mask the clarinets. This is why they must be scored *creatively.* My point was less that a clarinet section sounds like a violin section, because that's not really very accurate. However, a solo clarinet can sound very similar to a solo violin. A clarinet and violin duet may sound like a slightly reedy violin duet. A clarinet section playing an accompaniment part (say, the upbeats in a march) along with violins and violas in harmony (i.e. not doubling the clarinets in unison or octaves) are less likely to be covered up than if they were literally doubled in unison. Also don't take for granted the change in timbre even if the clarinets are "covered up."

Notice, for example, the clarinet unison in the Andante maestoso of Holst's Jupiter (where they take the melody a3 along with the strings and solo trumpet). The use of trumpet solo is designed to help the melody project more (in, for lack of better words, a "triumphant" style). The clarinet a3 helps the trumpet to blend with the violins by bridging the gap, as it were, between a brassy timbre and a string timbre. The clarinets themselves are technically not able to be heard, but the timbre is distinctly different than if they were not there. Sorry if that explanation doesn't make much sense. I can try to elaborate if needed.

&gt;These are just a handful of ways to spice up your sounds. There are infinitely more, and you'll just have to experiment with them to figure out what you like.
&gt;&gt;"Experiment" is a strange word to use for an expensive ensemble that requires a lot of manpower and a huge amount of skill to write for. Assuming OP even has access to an orchestra, I would be incredibly surprised if the conductor or any of the musicians tolerated repeated experimentation with bad orchestration that wastes their rehearsal time. Better and cheaper is to get a couple of books on orchestration (Rimsky-Korsakov, Piston, Adler, Gerou/Black), do exercises, have a composer who knows what they are doing critique said exercises, and study the shit out of scores. And no, sound libraries are not the same thing as a real orchestra.

You're right - "experiment" was the wrong choice of word here. I mostly meant through score-reading, finding what pairings sound good to OP in professional orchestra recordings. Orchestration books are an essential tool in an orchestrator's arsenal, and I also highly recommend Thomas Goss's orchestration tutorial videos on YouTube (Orchestration Online is the channel).

Great comments. Good on you for holding me accountable and making sure I'm not just talking out of my ass. Good suggestions as well.

Your explanations however may be just being modest or you may want to review what you did as a musical analysis of how and what you used that you got from your studies. 

Can you describe how you developed your orignian ideas and how you used form to put it all together. I see some reference to that, but do you know or is it all instinct? 

It really doesn't matter. The proof is in the pudding and your pudding is quite well done and it takes a lot of things to keep interest in a 4+ minute Duet? or did I miss a Bass part or something? 

Nice job. BUT how you used the theory, etc is important to help you build a dependable process and for future growth I would suggest a few things. 

Did you analyze what you were going to do before you realized it with your messing around to find the material to do it with? You don't have to but it is a good way to put our a constently good product. If you did or not, you should take some time and do a through analysis of what you did now that its finished. 

It sounds like you had a form in mind from close to the beginning. No matter where it happened, you created a nice form. You should make note of what the form was and how your development of your beginning ideas were used to keep giving something that was familiar to your listener from the first time you presented it and how you connected and what you connected and how you changed it as you progressed through the composition. 

You should probably take your original material and self study how you changed things when you used them again in a modified way. 

And don't forget to look at the contrasting sections to see how they relate yet are different so don't forget that there is texture and styles that are as important as the notes and the harmony. 

this is just some rambling of what I heard and the reason you should self analyze is so that you understand how you used a little bit of original creation of motifs and build them into a larger whole. 

You may even discover that you have instinctively created a lot of development and not really thought of what you were doing, but just heard it. 

Don't worry about studying what you did might hinder your creativity, when you are creative, it all comes out instinctively. No problem, but then when your next block happens, your study will allow you to remember how you looked at what you did here and when you do some of the same processes with different "things that sound good" you will know "how to make them work" from your analysis of this and other pieces. and the same techniques put in different forms and with different melodic an dharmonic motifs, it will be still very well created and with your self study, the craftsmanship will also grow with your way of using ideas in creative ways. 

Any way, just some thoughts about your composition and your comments on a very nice composition. You may or may not want to do any more work on it. Its fine as it is unless you discover from what you did how you might like it to be just a bit different. that's OK as even if you just think of it, you will add to your techniques of applying your theory to your next composition. AND THAT is the value of theory so, I suggest that you get into the habit of organizing the theory that you have studied. 

I hope you understand what I am saying. You made goof use of what you are describing as basic theory but you have used the basic theory very well. I am just spouting off some ideas of how to make your creative center understand how to supply you with creative ideas for your next composition. Its with the next and then the next and then the next and then the ones that you have a deadline on getting done that a little extra bit of work to understand HOW you used the theory to create your music will come in very handy! 

Keep up what you are doing and make sure you review it both as you create and to reevaluate what you did. AND most importantly, keep in touch. I am interested to hear what you will come up with next.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-11-13 06:22:19 uberhaxed<br>I assume you're not grouping rhythm and tempo as the same thing and are really just talking exclusively about tempo. Tempo in general is what turns noise into music when you have several people playing, so when you are solo it doesn't really have much importance. If you do play with accompaniments, then they will simply have to follow you, as so accompaniments (which may be an entire band) follows a soloist in classical  (etc.) music. 

If you're playing a duet (not quite the same) you'll need tempo since there's no one to control time and you'll eventually start playing out of sync. Same for any size ensemble greater than 1.

So in general, a soloist plays using rubato and the accompaniment, whether it's 1 or 50 people, follow him (for larger group sizes, this is usually a conductors job). For an ensemble, a single person (who may not be playing an instrument) keeps tempo for everyone else. For solo players, there's no need for this since you don't have to play in sync. Now before you ask about jazz ensembles of 20 people without conductors, they still have a person responsible for keeping time (the drummer). 

On a different note, 
&gt; but overall I don't feel a consistent beat or tempo. 

There isn't a rule in music with forbids temporary time distortions, (such as accelerando or ritardando) or out right changing of tempo at certain points in the song. Or time signatures for that matter. In fact probably half of all classical music has a change in tempo somewhere (most of them counting for ritardando before a fermata but I digress) so there isn't a need for such a thing as consistent time so long as the ensemble is playing in the same time.

On a really, really, low key side note
&gt; consistent rhythm

&gt; "bad" rhythm

&gt; fluctuating rhythm

You're confusing the definition of rhythm with tempo. Rhythm is the word we use for the pattern of notes playing in time, where tempo is what we call time.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-11-18 20:36:55 Jongtr<br>You need to learn the chords, pure and simple.

I presume you know some scale patterns (please don't call them "modes" ;-)).  Assuming they are full 7-note scales - not pentatonics - you should be able to see chord shapes within them.  Every chord in the key is contained within every scale pattern for that key - because every chord in the key is composed of notes from that scale.   (Many songs will deviate from the diatonic chords (the set within the key), but then the scale will deviate too.)

If you're a guitarist (can I assume that? ;-)), not all the chord shapes are playable as shapes you may recognise, but they're all there as arpeggios.

What you need to do, for any song or chord sequence you want to solo on, is first play through the chords. Try to find different shapes for each chord in different regions of the neck - at least in the same positions where you know the scale patterns.  If you only know chord shapes in one position (say, open position), then that's where you must play your solo, if you're going to understand how to follow the chords.  But ideally, you will be able to find suitable chord shapes everywhere.  If you know your fretboard, you can pick any neck position, and find all the chords you need there - and of course, a scale pattern that will fit around them all.

And that's just the start.  Working from the chords will at least make your solo sound like it *fits*.  But a good solo depends on good *phrasing*, using melody and rhythm in interesting ways.  It doesn't have to be clever or fast, it can be very simple in terms of note choice and speed.  But it must feel like you could sing each phrase (if your voice could get that high or low).  And to learn how to do that, you need to learn as many melodies as you can.  Copying licks from great solos is all very well, but copying vocal melodies is more useful - that's where the language comes from.

So this should be your two-pronged plan of action now:

1. Learn your fretboard, in terms of chord shapes.  The CAGED system can help here.  Every one of the 12 major chords is playable in 5 different shapes, which all overlap up the fretboard.  So you can play any chord anywhere.  (Minors are trickier, as there are only 3 standard shapes, Em-Am-Dm, so there are gaps in the system - but partial shapes and arpeggios are still available.)  When you can play (for example) an A, D and E chord all in the same neck position, you should see that they all spell out an A major scale pattern in that position. (You can call it a "mode" if you like, but don't let the fancy label distract you ;-).)

2. Start playing along with songs, and try to copy the vocal melody, or interject with responses to the melody, as if you were singing backup or a duet.  You don't really have to get the same notes, you just have to get into the process of *call-and-response*.  Copy the rhythm if you can't copy the notes.  Listen to blues players, and how they will play little responding phrases between their vocal phrases, as if they're talking to themselves.

The answer is complicated for me.  Having an understanding of music makes me able to appreciate a lot of music in a way that I couldn't without it; basically it has the effect /u/m3g0wnz mentioned.  

But the flip side is that I can also tell when something isn't that special.  The number of people who post to /r/piano in a year with their "compositions" that are constructed entirely of I-vi-IV-V arpeggiated which they think are somehow amazing and new just make me shake my head like a grumpy old man.  It's the type of thing that I would jokingly improv on if I was trying to be trite.  

I don't say that to be a dick.  But for them it's magical and for me it's not.  There was a time when I remember thinking a particular 4-3 suspension in a song was magical an angelic.  Now I know how the sausage is made.  I hear them all the time and my brain identifies them as easily as the color red.  It's not incredible to me.

The better I get, the less and less of those magical sounds exist.  And to make matters worse, since it's literally my job to play, when I hear something I don't know it's a cue to get down to work and fix that gap in my knowledge.  So in that way, it has a somewhat negative connotation.  That said, I personally love learning and discovering things that fill gaps in my knowledge, so at least I get some joy out of that, though sometimes I'm too busy with actual work to just enjoy discovery because my time and mental capital are limited.

**Musicianship**

The thing that has most sullied my enjoyment of music is just getting better overall.  I simply can't turn off my critical ear.  Bad tuning in particular is something I just can't push through to enjoy.  It will stick out to me badly in an otherwise good performance.  I notice bad diction.  I notice bad vocal technique and can't help but having a running commentary in my head saying things like, "Man, his Es are too wide and his vowels are too far back."

Uneven sixteenth notes will bother me more than most.  Inconsistent time.  Bad conducting with too many or unclear ictus.  Bad tone quality on instruments.  And once again, the more I know about them first hand, the worse it is.  Taking methods classes on various instrument in college basically opened up a whole new door of problems I previously didn't know to listen for.  I'm always thinking how to correct problems rather than just listening. 

The list could seriously go on.  I just not longer have the capacity to enjoy a lot of performances with blind wonder like I did when I was younger.   It's probably largely a result of spending so much personal time practicing where I'm constantly trying to be critical of my own playing in order to improve.  I'm also frequently in a position where someone is asking for my critical ear to judge their students or ensemble or composition.

I have a feeling someone who works on something like lighting or something similar for films would have the same problem.  They literally can't just not look at how the lighting is done in ever frame of TV or film they watch for good or ill.

**Work**

Another mess is that I'm constantly thinking about how music relates to work.  For one, if it's a song I've had to learn for work purposes I'll often end up despising it.  Or sometimes I start out getting more appreciation for it only to end up not enjoying it once it's fully picked apart and repeated 100 times.

Then there's the issue of just thinking about music for wok.  I hear a song and my brain starts trying to arrange it for the instrumentation of my band, or for piano solo, or for accordion solo, maybe for a way to to do it as a duet with my wife.  So I either actively don't listen or I start dissecting the music I'm hearing.

And then there's the effect that spending hours a day working on music makes me not want to sit down and listen to music for fun.  Most of my time is spent listening to podcasts and audiobook.   I hear about people who work with computers all day who don't want to come home and play games on their PC.  The want to play on their couch because they've already been sitting in front of a screen all day.  So it's basically that.


**Time and Age**

There was definitely a point in college where I just loved it.  I loved learning stuff and appreciating it because it was still new to me. It was like going from seeing the world in black and white to suddenly seeing color, but now I've seen it for so long it's not as magical.  I think the people who manage to enjoy it the most further into their careers are those who happened to be able to go directly into the particular niche that interests them and find success just doing a deep dive on that.  That's not case.  I'm a mercenary and try hard to be well rounded so I can do anything someone asks of me, but that also means I have to spend a lot of time working on music that I don't find personally enjoyable and that's draining.

I think the jadedness comes with age and experience.  I've had a lot of shop talk with older musicians in my position and it's a similar story unless they found a niche doing only styles they loved.  But the other effects are all present.  The inability to turn of the critical ear and the view that it's work.  

At the end of the day, in spite of the flaws of working as a musician, I love what I do.   I've spend enough time doing manual labor in the Texas summers to know better than to complain too much, but it is still work and it does have its downsides once you've done it long enough.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-12-03 07:57:46 Xenoceratops<br>&gt;I'm not having him learn "major second, minor second, etc" or "transcribe this." If I wanted to not make sense, I'd try teaching music through pen and paper and say, "The piano is over there -- once we cover all of these topics, you'll hear what it sounds like." Theory without a physical analogy (eg. actually experiencing a perfect fifth or a major chord) is useless. Theory as a way to go from one topic into another, though -- I don't see a problem. As long as we're not getting bogged down in details, it gives a good road map to what order concepts need to be presented, and I use it to answer questions that arise, if they arise naturally from the student. I won't hit them over the head with a textbook, but I'm sure not going to hide it and pretend it doesn't exist.

I agree with you here for the most part. What I worry about is that you're teaching the way you "think it should be taught" rather than attending to the student's specific needs. I've been there myself (on both ends), so I'd like to think I can offer some words of caution. I've had students who learn concepts easily when they are formed as a syllogism: if P, then Q, purely consequential. I've had students who do not jive with that sort of logical progression and need to just play without knowing what the hell they are doing for a while before they can start putting labels (sometimes haphazardly) to their actions. And everything in between. I've had teachers who have gotten pissed at me because I was converting their tablature into staff notation (for rhythm) because they believed that would somehow sully the learning process, despite the fact that I often found and corrected errors that way (usually parts ending at different times in a duet, etc.). I've had breakthroughs from teachers who have gone back in a very non-linear way to correct issues with my technique. I've put up with things that I "do not believe in" and learned things that way despite the fact that I still do not believe them. (And I still totally disagree with those things, but I can at least substantiate my position.)

If this is your first student (or at least your first student whose musical intelligence is so far below your own that you fail to comprehend it), then you will probably have some good interactions as well as some bad interactions. You will learn as well, and the next time you go into something like this you will (hopefully) do it better. That's the way it goes. You cannot predict what will work best for any student, in spite of whatever philosophy you may hold.

Most of the artists you named can be linked to the 70s, some to the 60s too.

With this in mind, Blackjack are not 80s. Compare them to early Foreigner or Toto if you like. However, they are Michael Bolton's 70s gig.

Kenny Loggins had the Loggins and Messina partnership, which gave us Danny's Song and What a Fool Believes.

It may be useful to study the rise and fall of the bridge in pop music, which became less important and was reduced to a habit of only presenting a breakdown by the time the era of SAW was around. This may link to the rise of Hip Hop.

For all the white people not making hair metal, refer to this, and note the photo you'll see right away:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-eyed_soul

The Jacksons and Rockwell trace to the 50s and 60s through their parents. Rick James was active but not famous through the 60s and 70s. Depending on how much influence you want to account for, a lot of artists of the 60s-80s can fit in their bubble.

The keys to the sound of their songs is the use of early digitally controlled synths, which had hybrid links to analog technology, and in certain cases, the influence of early Hip Hop. Otherwise, this music can be analyzed in the same way as funk.

Of these, I knew the least about Jennifer Rush, but upon peeking at wiki I realize she links Bon Jovi to Michael Bolton. If we take her, Bon Jovi, and Alice Cooper...

This is a suburban hard rock trend most personified in Kiss in the US and Slade in the UK, a way for kids to express singer without leaving the corporate umbrella like punk, or having religious/antireligious connotations that less pop friendly forms of metal had. This music is similar to late 60s-70s "classic rock" made with instruments that had improving intonation characteristics and relatively new digital effects.

If you need a keystone that links these pedigrees together, it is Thriller. It merged rising synthesizer and drum box technology, metal via Eddie van Halen's role in Beat It, and white soul via the role of the members of Toto. It also had a duet with Paul McCartney, so I'm going to give you one more thing to think about:

Beatlesque, a trend of bands who intentionally recreated the styles of the Beatles and Beach Boys.

Without the full context of the piece its hard to say exactly what those "cue notes" actually are but you will run into them from time to time as you play through literature. I use the word "cue" as you will often see these up/down stems as a cue so that you can see what else is going on in the music. You will also see that in some four part chorales that are written on the grand stave but the smaller note fonts generally mean its another instrument of voice that would not be played unless that voice of part is absent.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-02-15 04:53:23 Evan7979<br>So New Grove Dictionary of Music (peer-reviewed musicological entries that professors and academics of music theory and musicology write, proof-read and check) states that orchestration is:

(1) The art of scoring mus. for an orch. or band. Many composers show special skill in this, e.g. Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, while Berlioz, Wagner, Mahler, Elgar, Strauss, Ravel, Rimsky-Korsakov and Britten were all masters of the art.

(2) Arr. of a work for orch. which was comp. for another medium, e.g. Ravel's orchestration of his own Ma Mère l'Oye for pf. duet.


So if you want authority deciding what is and what isn't orchestration this is it. People here state that they go to college or have professors who say what it is or isn't as if that makes it final and correct. But professors make mistakes. Even ones with doctorates. This is how those mistakes are mitigated: a load of them get together and decide what it is or isn't and peer-review it.

When you spell a chord by using the voices weave through the harmonic structure to create the music its the way you connect tones that are being used to form the chords. The idea is to spell the chords while haveing each voice have a stand alone melody that interacts with the other notes to spell the chords. 

each voice of part is seen as connecting the dots of acceptable notes that spell the chords. The ART is to not only spell the chords but to give each part an logical and musical entity of its own so that the ear is guided through the chords in a musical manner what is smooth and logical. 

In more technical terms, its a contrapuntal way of spelling the chords when you start with the chord structure and then write the voices that define the chords being used. 

In traditional schooling, it is usually taught in SATB choral settings but it applies to any amount of voices being used to connect the notes to spell chords.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-04-10 18:59:49 Schoenberg-<br>I have three general suggestions.

1. Use good headphones/speakers and good source audio. Cheap headphones and/or bad source audio muddle the sound and distort the audio, sometimes cutting out entire instruments. If you find that you can pick out voices much more easily at a live performance, these things are holding you back. Having good audio makes a huge difference. Although, sometimes an instrument is legitimately drowned out, in which case there's nothing you can do.

2. I'm not certain how intent you are on improving your aural skills, but if you're quite serious, the ability to hear multiple lines simultaneously is invaluable. The main obstacle lies in hearing notes simultaneously; when hearing a chord, instead of just hearing the highest note and noticing the "color" of the chord, you should be able to hear each note individually. It is difficult to hear more than two lines at once, but if successful, you'll find that picking out different melodic lines is as easy as picking out different colors on a painting. 

3. Lastly, I'd suggest practicing on easier pieces and work your way up. If you cannot distinguish between different instruments in a complex texture (yet), and wish to attain that ability, listening to an orchestral piece is poor practice. You mention that you can hear the cellos playing the melody at the beginning of the excerpt; it's actually violins, violas, cellos, and horns playing the melody in unison. I'd recommend something where each melodic line is played by a single instrument, something like [this trio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF_rJaVWgYI), a [duet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWOEMqeE5uo), or even a solo, and work your way up in complexity. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-04-26 13:33:15 ljse7m<br>Ok, what is Cx and not C# are you leaving the chords now and  which scale spelling are you referring to? 

Also, yes, there are voice leading involved and it may or may not be 4 part. Just as in all music, it can be 2 part, 3 part, 4 part of Xpart. There is always proper voice leading except maybe in the elementary levels of playing a keyboard or guitar when the player does not know how to voice the harmony. That is where the spelling of the Chords are important and if you are using scales to think (which is a very good way of thinking about it) about connecting the harmony, then the scale should reflect the notation of the chord spelling as well as chords are built from the scales and not really the other way around. 

Now you are talking about ONE voice in this post, the bass voice. Even if it is a solo, the bass line will be going up the chord tones with possible passing tones but the end result will have to be for him to emphasize the important tones to imply the connection of the Root third or what ever implied voicing is based upon the chord. Generally speaking, there will be as many implied "voices" as there are chord tones. And the way the bass player uses the scale to outline the chords of the measure he is playing, will want to emphasize the chord structure that he is thinking in his part of the voicing. He will do this by using chord tones and passing tones or just by arpeggiation. To understand what he should be playing you should write out the voicing of each chord with the same number of tones in both cords. (sometimes you will leave out some less important tones in the harmonic voicing Then connect the tones as if each note was a voice. Then you will be able to decide which notes to emphasize when you run your scale through this end result of how one chord connects to the other chord. After you do this for a while it will become easier and if you really do it well, you will start to hear it as how the chords connect properly. You see, with complex harmonies either in classical music or Jazz or any genre, there are often times when you can't or don't want to use all the notes of all the chords. This happens in a trio or in a duet or just any time that you want a more sparse texture. So when you are talking about the bass for example. He probably will not want to and certainly does not have to play all the notes of either chord nor does he have to play all the notes of the scale. BUT he has to understand what the correct way to connect the chords are and then he can sketch a part of that with his instrument. If he has help, like say a tenor sax, the Sax player does the same thing. if its three horns, the Trumpet would sketch out some of the notes. If you are writing it out, the composer uses what he has in the group to have the entire ensemble collectively sketched out to create the harmony. 
In a piano bass and horn usually the Bass will connect the lower parts of the harmony and the stronger tones associated with tonality and the horn player will play mostly the sketch of the melody and take care of those notes and their connections as he uses the proper scales with passing and cord tnes to complete another part of the harmony and the pianist will fill in what ever else is needed, A good group will listen to each other and learn to supply their parts of the "sketch" to produce the voices that are necessary for the group to have that proper sound. The voice leading is there, its just improvised and spontaneous but each player needs to understand their part and improvise accordingly. This is not easy and many groups decide to "write it out" to a larger degree as their improvisatory skills are not that well developed or if they want their Jazz to be more composed  than improvised. In this case the arranger or composer will sketch out each voice. Music is music. If harmony is involved, there is always voice leading. In some genres it is more important than others and the degree of the musicianship of the group and composer if applicable will determine if it is truly artistic or just "close enough for Jazz". 

If you are taking the time to try to understand the theory behind it, I would hope that you would want to set the highest standards possible or you would not be wasting your time to create the theory (which is why I bother to ask you these questions as you seem to want to understand what is going on) that is behind what the ideal solution is when you are writing or improvising on the harmony. In the end, you will want to hear this! 

So that is what is going on. You may not understand it yet, but YES, there are part writing rules that make the arrangement sound OK, or close enough, or correct or artistic. That what your project is about. You are searching for a way to understand the voice leading when you created the spellings of the scales you are using. You seem to have the basic idea but you are not quite there yet but you are not that far away from at least understanding what you are striving for. That is why I am taking the time to help you discover for yourself how to "get it right" so that you can create better voicing an harmonic voice leading. Only you can decide how deeply you want to get into this. 

I hope you are starting to see what I am trying to have you discover. I am here if you need it, but you have to understand that certain things you seem to think might not be exactly how they are when you get down to the details. There is voice leading and there are ways of properly defining the sound you think that there is special rules for good music that Jazz does not have to follow, well, frankly you will never understand how some groups sound GREAT and others are simply "close enough for Jazz".

I'm influenced by a lot of what you just wrote. The last track on my last album is a 55-minute prog epic directly inspired by Genesis/Yes/Pink Floyd as well as BTBAM/Ayreon/Transatlantic. Also on that album are songs influenced by Mastodon/Intronaut ("Heliamartia"), Isis/Cult of Luna ("Light Wells" and "Synthetic Eclipse", the latter featuring the vocalist of Crib45, who you should absolutely check out in your post-metal exploration), Opeth ("The Devil's Miracles"), and more. There are also *loads* of math/music nerd compositional quirks, like a broad palette of odd time signatures and additive meter (some 11/4 as 3+4+4 on "Light Wells", 7+7+6+5 in the bridge of "Amethysts", 25/16 on "Cherubae", 9/4 on "Fear and Bright", 7/4 and 9/4 on "Heliamartia" which come together and overlap in the outro, 7/4 and 5+5+5+6 on "Adamah, Anima", 5/4 and 11/8 on "Fallow Soil", 17/16 on "Blue Agave Prism", 11/8 on "Shadetree", 13/8 drum duet on "Lamppost", and of course a ton of variations inside "Wayward Stars"). 

And that's just my latest album. Before that was a funeral doom trilogy ("Agatha" through "Maribel"), and two albums of proggy post-metal more in the CoL/Isis vein ("Kingdoms" and "The Greater Gospel"), each of which have some unique structures and compositions but not as psychotic and diverse as on "The Paragon Trisagion". 

Anyway, sorry to sound self-aggrandizing, but I thought you might definitely appreciate some of those details more than most people. Let me know if you check some of my stuff out and what you think! 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-09-21 08:42:24 bmize<br>Hey! Not your colleague. I do not co teach AP. If your target performers are educated musicians, they *should* (I say that not intending elitism,  but I do realize how it reads...) not balk at rhythms like that last one, all of the people I know that are into that kind of thing are into that funky shit. 

Also, are you planning on fleshing out the piano part at all? Looking through the score, a lot of that stuff looks like it would be really cool as a flute/4 mallet marimba duet. Some of the wider chords might need revoicing, and there is the low end to worry about, but marimba players can roll chords similar to how piano players do.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-04 04:32:34 spoonopoulos<br>I haven’t, but Barry Vercoe’s group at the MIT Media Lab worked significantly on machine listening for decades. Check Paris Smaragdis’s work out, for example.

There’s quite a lot of work on composition - Robert Rowe’s book *Machine Musicianship*, though a bit dated, offers an introduction if you have a little programming experience. There are a lot of researchers to talk about, from David Cope to Barry Vercoe to more recent work like Google’s Wavenet, AI Duet or more generally the magenta team’s work, and a lot of different tech too - from hidden markov models to convolutional neural nets with raw Audio models (I.e. Wavenet and derivations), etc.

I’m not as familiar at all with work on computer assisted analysis other than the popular examples (music21, harmonia, etc.), especially as it relates to AI, but hopefully someone else can chime in there.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-13 08:14:24 65TwinReverbRI<br>OK, a little advice.

Walk before you can run.

Many "composers" want to start out writing a "Symphony" or something.

Mozart didn't even start out writing a Symphony!

IOW, most of the famous composers (and musicians) we know of we know from their "mature" or "developed" works, not their "student" or even "beginner" works. But most concert pianists started with "Twinkle Twinkle" - they may have accelerated more quickly than the rest of us, but they still had to start somewhere!

It may be a little overly adventurous for you to try to tackle writing for Band when you don't even know how to write for a single instrument yet (that's an assumption I'm making, sorry if it's a wrong one, but I'm trying to make a point).

What instrument do you play? Maybe should start with a Duet for you and a friend to play on something like Trumpet and Clarinet, or something like a "Bugle Call" or "March Tune" for Trumpet and Drum.

Or if you can work at the Piano, maybe for your instrument with Piano accompaniment.

When you get into the whole band, you're talking about "orchestration" and "arranging" beyond the scope of the basic musical form you'd use for a piece for fewer players (typically).

Do you know the ranges of all the instruments? Do you know the transpositions?

One thing a lot of beginners do is "model" their piece on another known piece. Maybe you can find a waltz for band and use the "skeleton" of it, while filling in your own details as far as rhythm, harmony, and melody choices. Have you studied the scores of great band arrangers?

I'd say I'm decent, I've written for orchestration before but I'd like to get better. I have written like 15 pieces for piano half of which are notated and I've done 2 covers of song one of which is a violin and piano duet. I am currently in a music theory class it's more like music notation and history class. It's a high school level class and I know everything about it already and I'd like to stop taking it. I would kill to take some real college level music theory classes but I am but a poor high school student living in his parents abode 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-11-13 19:25:56 Jongtr<br>In general I listen to everything I can.  I don't analyze relationships of course.  I'd no more think "that's a minor 7th" when playing than I would think "that's an adverb" when I'm speaking.  
Of course, if asked I could tell you that kind of information, but it's an intuitive language when playing.

Specifically - as a guitar player in a rock band (which I am most of the time), I listen to the singer first, drummer second.  
When I play bass, I listen to the drummer first, and perhaps exclusively - although of course I'm aware of the song structure, and listening and watching for cues from the singer.  
When I play jazz, I try to listen to the whole band equally, because every musician is going to improvise his/her part to some extent, and it's important not to get in anyone's way.  In rock it doesn't matter too much if you are doubling up what someone else is playing, because you often want a wall of "sound" - you very rarely want that in jazz.  Because of the (at least partially) improvised nature of the music, it's much more important to be able to pick up on what the others are playing.  I need to be able to hear, eg, if the pianist throws in an altered dominant, so I can respond.  If I'm comping, or playing a duet solo, I need to be able recognise certain chord tones or extensions being played, again so I can respond.  This is never the case in rock - when I solo in rock it's only ever the drummer that might throw in something unexpected (which is always worth listening out for, and easier to respond to).

In any style, I'm *feeling* the structure of the tune rather than counting bars or beats.  Sometimes when a tune has a very long section on one chord I might be dividing it up mentally into halves to keep track of where I am.  E.g., for 16 bars on one chord, I'll be thinking 8+8, then 4+4+4+4 - but still more feeling and visualising than actual counting numbers.

When it comes to a jam session, then figuring things out quickly may become much more crucial.  What key are they in?  What is this tune? What's that chord sequence?  (Hopefully you'll be told the first two, but you may still need to work out the third by ear on the spot.)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-12-05 05:59:51 65TwinReverbRI<br>Well, wait, accompaniment is different from "flourishes".

Let's say you have a Piano and Trumpet Duet for Jolly Old St. Nicholas.

The Trumpet plays the melody.

The Piano, if just playing chords, is playing the Accompaniment.

When the trumpet is not playing, it's probably resting between phrases - after the end of each line.

So are you talking about what happens between the last note of "way" and "Don't" (end of first line, beginning of 2nd) in the Trumpet part?

Or are you saying that there's a passage of music where the trumpet plays somehting that's not the melody, but just to keep interest in the piece until the melody comes back around again - like an 8 measure "interlude" or the "introduction" repeated between verses?

Maybe you mean "refrain" as well - which often happens with Christmas music - a lot of Christmas music has multiple verses but people often just sing the first verse and the refrain.

But really, that would totally depend on the arrangement - so you'd be digging through lots of pieces to find any kind of refrain or interlude where the trumpet played, but didn't play the melody of the song.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-12-14 10:41:10 jameshufflesnuff<br>Jazz ensemble is actually where I got the idea for the ensemble. and I was thinking of having the flute be somewhat tied to the female lead's voice, since it's a higher pitch. Those all sound like good ideas though. Another major song I've been thinking of for reference is Broken by Seether, which I think handles the rock duet style very well. The major problem I'm having though is that the song only has a piano chart, so I don't really know how to write ensemble music based off of the piano chart, whereas it's much easier for guitar and bass

A duet?

Popular songs sung without accompaniment like Church (Gregorian) Chant or hymns, Barbershop or A cappella groups?

Why not just sing *Auld Lang Syne* and have someone else or your teacher sing the root or other corresponding chord tone?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-01-17 02:41:17 Jongtr<br>The Ink Spots section is in F and Ella's is in Bb.  

It's a 32-bar form, which I'd call A-B, 16 bars each.  (Ella's section just repeats the sequence a 4th higher.)

The 3rd time through stays in Bb , with the spoken section over the first 16, and vocal duet on the second 16.

The intro is the last 8 bars of the form (common jazz practice) in F.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-02-07 04:56:01 Yeargdribble<br>I don't think I can remember a time, even back to my teens, that I could use music for concentration, but it's only gotten worse.  This is one of the big things I warn people about when they want to pursue music as a profession.  At some point you pull back the curtain and see the wizard and you can't undo it.  The deeper you go, the more you "see the Matrix."

As your theory and ear knowledge gets better, you just inevitably notice pieces of that language in anything you listen to.  I'm sure you could listen to someone ramble in a foreign language you don't speak and still focus on your work, but as you learn more words in that language, more of them will jump out at you and distract you.  That's exactly what's happening with music, but it goes further.

If you studied a language more deeply, you'd probably start to find yourself unable to ignore poor pronunciation from those trying to speak it, but not as fluently as yourself.  It's nails on a chalkboard.  It's same with music.  My tolerance for bad tuning and *slightly* out of pocket rhythm has gotten progressively lower over my life time.  It makes it very difficult to listen to most hobbyist musicians playing live and often unbearable to listen to student ensembles.

This problem is escalated by the fact that I literally spend all day being ridiculously self-critical.  That's what practice is about.  You're ironing out all of those little problems.  You're hyper-tuned in to little mistakes.  And for me at least, I can't turn it off when I go listen to others and I become intensely critical even though I won't say anything (unless specifically asked, and even then I tend to be as tactful as possible).

For a long time, ambient music was my solution.  As long a there's no motion, especially that I could recognize, I was good.  But now I just hear parallel 9ths, spacey Lydian polychords, etc.  I literally can't help but pay attention and eventually deconstruct what I'm hearing and once I do, I can't unhear it.  Or if I don't intentionally deconstruct it, I'll stumble across something on Youtube that elucidates the idea for me and it literally clicks almost instantly (this literally happened with a recent Nahre Sol video for me).

And while I don't get paid to play ambient music (directly) I get paid to play lots of other stuff and here's where things get messy.  When I was a kid, 4-3 suspensions were magic to me.  But now they are a simple label and easy to hear and have been for over a decade.  They are still pretty, but not magical.  And therein lies the problem. My job requires me to get better at lots of styles.  And basically any time I hear something I don't understand, I feel it's incumbent upon me to figure out why I don't get it, and so the mystery gets sucked away.  

So that's why (for me personally) a lot of the recommendation here don't work. Listen to atmospheric stuff... but then have the tools to break it down.  Listen to more complex stuff... well now I feel compelled to deconstruct it until I understand it.

I still love all of these things.  I actually really like knowing what's going on and being able to replicate it.  It also allows you to hear things others might not.  There's a lot of subtlety hidden out there, or even if it's not subtle, sometimes it's clever and just makes you grin.  But it's not mysterious.  It's not magical or ethereal.  It's like reading words. 

But the rabbit hole goes deeper.  I've spent so much time arranging music for different groups, that I just can't turn that off either.  I played keys in a band with no guitarist for years and so I was constantly having to arrange all sorts of music with guitars or even full horn sections for keys to get the feel of the song across.  I've also done a lot of duet work (particularly with my wife) and I've done more formal arranging for small, odd combinations of winds/strings.

As a result, when I hear music I'm basically constantly breaking it down into its constituent parts... rhythm, bass, harmony, melody, and trying to arrange it mentally for different groups of instruments.  As I do slightly less of that work now, it's not quite as bad, but it still happens frequently and most especially if I find a song catchy or enjoyable.  "How can I arrange this for solo accordion?  How could I use my looper to play the changes into my keyboard and then play the leads on trumpet?  That harmony part would sound great with tenor and flugel!  Could I adjust the character of this for my wife play a jazzy clarinet version?  What the best way to replicate that rhythmic feel on just a guitar?"

So I tend to warn people who want to major in music because it's magical and wonderful to them...don't.  I figure it's this way for almost any field.  If you become a lighting designer you probably can't see any movie without thinking about how scenes are lit in movies or what color temperatures are used, etc.  If you do sound work professionally for film, you probably can't ignore foley work and ADR.  

It's not that I don't love what I do, but a lot of people just don't realize that aspect of doing something professionally.  You lose the mystery (not to mention a lot if it involves working on things that you're not particularly passionate about).  I basically never listen to music casually any more just for enjoyment.  I mostly stick to podcasts and audiobooks.

As for studying, white noise is my friend.  I'd recommend [MyNoise](https://mynoise.net/) and even more highly recommend their app.  I do that for any studying I do as well as reading for enjoyment.  For intense practice, it just helps block out distracting sounds.  For less mentally taxing types of practice I'll actually turn on old podcasts or audiobooks I'm familiar with as a form of doodling.  The idea is it that it vaguely occupies the part of your mind that tends to wander and actually keeps you more focused.  But it's not presenting new or exciting info that your brain wants to zero in on.  I find this very useful when practicing pure technique stuff where I'm not having to sightread or quickly think through chords but instead I'm just working on a physical problem.  It helps keep me patient and focused on playing slowly, carefully, and deliberately rather than going into auto-pilot which is the real danger with technique practice and a hole a lot of people fall down.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-03-08 14:04:45 Xenoceratops<br>Two coexistent tonalities control a work. The complex is not bitonal per se, but from my understanding it can intersect with bitonality. In Bailey's interpretation, the double tonic complex pokes its head out from the background when there is a cadence onto a chord (chords?) that amalgamates the tonics.

&gt;The harmonic embodiment of this double tonic complex is a chord like [2c](https://i.imgur.com/fgwSs2H.png) but transposed up a minor 3rd so that it combines the notes of the A minor and C major triads. Wagner reserves this sonority until shortly before the end of the act, where he **lets it appear** [emphasis mine] for the first time at the conclusion of the short love duet that follows the drinking of the potion. The function of this major triad with added 6th should not be confused with the function of the added-6th chord in twentieth-century popular music, which acts simply as a decorated triad (a triad with an extra nontriadic note). The actual notes of the two chords are the same, but this double-triadic sonority functions here as the harmonic representative of the double-tonic complex at work throughout the structure.

&gt;Once the major triad with added 6th attains an important position in tonal vocabulary, the principle of modal mixture suggests a corresponding form in the minor scale.

&gt;[Example 4](https://i.imgur.com/rRaRLeE.png)

He goes on about how the minor-mode equivalent is the Tristan chord, and that Wagner replaces the Tristan chord with a major triad in later iterations of that motive.

Sometimes such Chamber Ensembles are named for the number of players (or parts). In this case a "Nonet" for 9 players (Duet, Trio, Quartet, Quintet, Sextet, Septet, Octet, Nonet - I've never seen any terms for higher than 9, usually just saying "for 13 winds" or something like that).

You didn't provide us with specific styles of music you like playing, so I'll do some recommendations in different genres for you.

Something poppy yet classic: Einaudi. *Le Onde*, his first album from 1996, is excellent!

Another thing you could consider is teaming up with another pianist and play a duet or quatre main, if that's allowed by your teacher. Hella fun to practice and perform. To name a song: *Megalovania*, arranged by Frank and Zach. Maybe go for another song, considering you only have four weeks. I needed ten with my mate.

Another piece that comes to mind is *Opening*, by Philip Glass. Not too difficult, but has a tricky polyrhythm which may take a while to get used to. It's definitely long enough and you can easily shorten it, because halfway in the piece the thing just starts over again.

I've got plenty ideas. To name a few, we've got i) Oscar Peterson. He's got sick jazz pieces and some are fun to play as a intermediate player, too! ii) Gershwin. simply beautiful songs... iii) Bach. Don't get scared here, he's got some great pieces which are doable for intermediate players. Your teacher will like them, because it's arguably classical jazz. iv) Beethoven. Maybe cliché, but still fun! v) Mozart. Don't forget this guy. He's made some serious works, too. vi) Do you like really poppy songs? Many are arranged for piano which are fun to play.

Hope it helps. Remember to have fun practicing a piece. Don't pick something that you can play right away. Don't pick Grieg's piano concerto in A minor, because the chance is small you pick this one up in four weeks. Pick something that's *difficult* yet *doable* for *you*. It's fun to challenge yourself and fail over and over again. At least, I think so!

Good luck and have fun.

EDIT: Your teacher should know enough about your piano skills to recommend you some pieces which will suit you, since the year is almost over and you've done other performances which were assessed by your teacher.

Sometimes I might start with an idea like "I'd like to write a duet for Flute and Cello" or something like that.

Sometimes, in a piece like that, I'll just kind of go over some "rough" things like, OK, I'd like there to be a section where the flute plays solo, and a section where the cello plays solo, etc.

For me, one thing that I've found helpful is so sort of take whatever my initial noodling idea was, and start trying to present it different ways - such as flute accompanied by pizz notes, or just one long drone note on cello, etc. I might do a more chordal accompaniment or a more contrapuntal one - I just "sketch" out ideas - I may or may not use them ultimately but it gives me "variations" that I can work with. I don't know that I've ever used repeat bars in a piece in the classical reprise sense, so when material returns I tend to present it in a different way. Short attention span.

I have tried to "force" myself to do things - one of the traps I all too frequently fall into is coming up with a little idea, then noticing, "oh hey, this really focuses on the interval of the 7th" and then I'll go way too far and want to try to write a piece based on the interval of a 7th. The inspiration goes when the "pre-conditions" set in.

But most of what I do kind of evolves as I'm writing. I have written things where I decided ahead of time it was going to be like a little Suite with 6 pieces in it, but I'd write the pieces out of order - which ever one was inspired first. I will sometimes thing, "I'd like a prelude-like thing to start it all, and a Binary Form Dance-like piece for one of the movements" and things like that.

I think for beginners, it really helps to have a "framework" - a skeletal structure you can start with. But as you get a little more experience, you can just set up some generalities (if that) and fill in the details as you work.

And of course, even if I do set out with some particular goals, they're ALWAYS subject to change!

2) Adding new instruments isn't super tricky, but not that easy either. Make sure you don't break the feel or flow of the song. If it goes with the lead, you can make it a small bit quieter than the lead and either have a funky duet between the two, have it follow a measure or a few beats behind, or match the lead completely.

3) For the love of god put some *real passion* in your music. I've seen too many artists give up because they study the rhythm and memorize all the scales and modes, but burn out because that's all that they're doing. The best music you can feel emotionally, on top of just hearing the notes and chords.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-06-18 08:19:02 65TwinReverbRI<br>We just usually say something like "hear". "Audiate" is of course a word, but it's not something most people use - sounds a little too "academic research papery"!

The process of being able to "mentally hear" what you see on paper is one of "internalizing" the sounds.

This is typically done through "ear-training" and "sight singing" and is supplemented by sight reading on instruments, transcribing, and overall just having "good ears".

It takes a lifetime of work - and some people are better at it than others.

As I said, sit down with a Bach Chorale - or whatever multi voice piece you are comfortable playing - even if it's a Duet as Korrun suggested, and play both lines. Then play one, and sing the other. Then switch. Sing along with playing, and leave a part out and sing that part.

Do this many times a day, every day. Also, sometimes make sure you try to sing things you've never seen before. Try singing just the Bass part of some Bach Chorale you've not seen before, then the Tenor line and so on.

Try recording one line on some device, then singing the other line - and build up the harmony bit by bit.

When you are listening to music, determine the tonic, then what scale degrees they are, and what chord members they are, and so on.

Listen to some 3 part harmony pieces, and try to transcribe them.

Singing things helps internalize them. That's why sight-singing is considered such an important skill.

If you look at a piece of paper, and the chords are C - Am - F - G - then you should have a t least a general idea of how that sounds. If not, you need to play it about a billion times, and then try singing the root movement, or maybe sing through arpeggiated versions of the chords and so on.

C-E-G-E | C-E-A-E | C-F-A-F | B-D-G-D or


C-E-G-E | A-C-E-C | F-A-C-A | G-B-D-G or whatever helps "get it in your mind's ear".

the more exercises like this you do, and the more you do them, the better you'll get at this.

Stop worrying about this word "audiate" and stop worrying about whether or not you're learning something by hearing it or seeing it or reading it.

And since you can play piano, you can play anything you can't sing at the same time. There's no way around that. Sing each line, play each line, play combinations of every line, and play and sing combinations of one voice part and the rest piano. That's what people do because that's all they can do.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-08-18 05:50:24 greatjasoni<br>You want things to be tangible and easy to hear. Key signatures are arbitrary and time signatures are usually too abstract to be interesting. You need to know what those things are when writing music, but when listening what's important are the equivalent concepts of tonal center and pulse. I'll write short examples of what you might want to say, just to contrast what I'm pointing out with what is typically taught to people. This stuff is intuitive and is the same as the approprach taken by a lot of textbooks, but the general principle is important to keep in mind. 

Tonal Center: When you play notes, the ear automatically hears one of them as home. Every single note you play becomes defined by its relationship to the home. Generally when you're listening, if you just hum the first tone that comes to mind, you'll be humming the tonic note. If not, you're probably humming the 5th. Either way it's a very tangible and immediate way of understanding that. If you play different notes in relation to home you get different modes, which is why people often label modes in terms of what notes are flatted relative to a major scale. Shifting keys is just shifting the home, and sometimes you'll hear that in really dramatic moments and you'll get a strange sound while your ear adjusts. A really easy way to point this out is to get on a piano and establish some key center, and then just hammer the leading tone above it till the tension is really high, and then resolve it to emphasize the feeling. You could even teach him how to do it, or do a duet where you hammer a C major chord and he feels the difference between a B on top of it, and a C on top of it. Then shift to an entirely different key like F# and do the same thing to point out how it sounds exactly the same with different notes. Play that same B and C you were playing earlier and note how they sound absolutely nothing like they did when you were in the key of C, despite being the same pitch. 

Pulse: When you hear sounds, your ear tries to find patterns in them. Try saying "One, Two, One, Two, One, Two..." out loud to yourself, then say "Two, One, Two, One..." and try and feel what the difference is. You're saying the exact same thing, yet one word feels dominant over the other. This same thing happens in music, and there's various ways of organizing that feeling. Try clapping along to a song, and feeling where one clap feels stronger than the others. Most pop songs are in a pattern of 4's and thus go: Strong weak ~weak weak. But this is arbitrary and there's plenty of music with a pattern of Strong weak weak, or Strong weak. Then you could listen to some waltzes, take 5 or 15 step, some marches, and other examples of varying pulse and really feel it. 

Notice how there's almost nothing about notes, or keys, or signatures or anything that would need to be on a page. It's just the phenomenology of listening to music. If you're not reading or writing or performing anything, then most music theory isn't helpful at all. Music theory is largely just a way of categorizing and labeling stuff, so that it can be easily communicated to others. Appreciating music by learning theory has little to do with how much you know, and more to do with how good your ears are at picking stuff apart. You don't need to understand the rules of functional harmony to appreciate classical music. But if you can feel when a "chord seems tense" vs "when it sounds like home," that is about 90% of the problem right there. The specifics of a Dominant7thb9 vs a tritone subsitution, or whatever it is, are pretty abstract and, to the listener, end up sounding like the exact same thing without years of training. 

Once this is internalized, then the more advanced stuff can come in. But until then, I'd stay away from jargon or anything for musicians as much as possible, and just sit down and clap with him. Or maybe practice harmonizing. Maybe have him *feel* the difference between an octave, a 5th, and a tritone by singing with you. He might not be able to remember them, but just internalizing the concept of dissonance vs consonance goes a lot to appreciating music better.

I think the one thing it might be okay to go in depth on early, is form. Understanding something like sonata form, or the structure of a jazz song, goes a long way towards enjoyment of the music and is hard not to hear. Jazz is a great example since they go from all playing a melody, to taking turns, to playing a melody again. It's intuitive and obvious while still hammering down overall principles of form.

This makes it seem as though you are portraying music theorists as know-it-alls putting people down from an ivory tower. I don't like it. Maybe that's how it was in 1875 (which is about a century before music theory even became a degree program, so don't use that date), but nowadays everyone is very professional and has an interest in making our discipline accessible both to our students and the public. Journals like [MTO](http://www.mtosmt.org/) and [SMT-V](https://societymusictheory.org/smt-v) are open-access and try to cater to audiences outside of the university (especially SMT-V, which is still pretty young).

We're not going to shit all over some rando's lack of music knowledge, because frankly we don't gain anything from it and music theorists are already an extremely small minority in music academia. In 2017, the Society for Music Theory, our main professional organization in North America, [had 1133 members](https://societymusictheory.org/files/SMT_Demographics_Report_2017.pdf). Few music schools in the US even have a PhD music theory program, and nobody is under the illusion that our position is exalted and untouchable. We want to attract people to our discipline, not push them away. We're in this because we like music and the analysis of music, not because it makes us look smart. There is no cabal of music theorists who get together and say, "How can we be even more elitist this year?" If you're thinking of suggesting that, please don't.

&gt;“why a diminished C chord causes dissonance when played over an E major flat in a minor key.”

That was painful to read. This is a sentence I would expect out of a freshman who doesn't do the work and doesn't get what this is all about. The syntax is all wrong ("C diminished chord", but I'm not sure whether you mean "C diminished triad" or "C diminished seventh chord"; "E-flat major", but you might clarify that it is an "E-flat major triad") and the language is doubtful (we generally don't refer to things being "over" one another except in undergraduate jazz pedagogy, where it's a shortcut; "causes dissonance" is a weak construction; drop the "in a minor key" thing because a dissonant polychord is going to be dissonant in any context). Moreover, the idea that something is dissonant is not compelling. Maybe it's cool when you're first learning this stuff, but my response to your sentence is, "Yeah? So?"

Here is a passage from [a famous chapter](https://www.docdroid.net/p0dx64g/bailey-tristan-doubletoniccomplex.pdf) by Robert Bailey. This is from a book that's 33 years old now, and methodologies have advanced since then. Not many people talk about double tonic complexes, but those who do certainly know this source. He talks about what he interprets as a polychord with far-reaching structural implications in the prelude from Wagner's [Tristan und Isolde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qoaioG2UA):

&gt;The new feature in Tristan with the most far-reaching consequences for large-scale organization is the pairing together of two tonalities a minor 3rd apart in such a way as to form a "double-tonic complex." The pairing of A and C for the whole of Act I may well have grown out of the traditional close relationship between A minor and C major, but the double-tonic idea goes well beyond merely beginning in a minor key and concluding in its relative major, as in Chopin's Scherzo in B- flat minor, Op. 31, and his F-minor Fantaisie, Op. 49. In some ways, the new concept plays upon that very closeness, but we are now dealing with the "chromatic" mode of A and the "chromatic" mode of C. The two elements are linked together in such a way that either triad can serve as the local representative of the tonic complex. Within that complex itself, however, one of the two elements is at any moment in the primary position while the other remains subordinate to it. The Prelude establishes the close duality between A and C,and this complex serves as the controlling tonic for the entire first act, which both begins (in the Prelude) and ends with the A/C complex. While A is the primary member within the complex through most of the Prelude, Wagner prepares the eventual shift of emphasis to C in the final section of the Prelude itself, which in turn prepares C as the central tonic (paired with E^(♭)) for the opening dialogue between Isolde and Brangäne. C attains the primary position within the tonic complex in the concluding sections of the act, and at the end Wagner deliberately sets Tristan's final speech apart from its context so that it forms a cadence in A, and then juxtaposes that cadence in A directly against the final orchestral cadence in C.

&gt;The harmonic embodiment of this double-tonic complex is a chord like Example 2C, but transposed up a minor 3rd so that it combines the notes of the A minor and C major triads (see Example 7 below). Wagner reserves this sonority until shortly before the end of the act, where he lets it appear for the first time at the conclusion of the short love duet that follows the drinking of the potion. The function of this major triad with added 6th should not be confused with the function of the added-6th chord in twentieth-century popular music, which acts simply as a decorated triad (a triad with an extra nontriadic note). The actual notes of the two chords are the same, but this double-triadic sonority functions here as the harmonic representative of the double-tonic complex at work throughout the structure. (121-122)

There's a point to him bringing up the polychord. It's linked to a real piece of music, a well-known and hotly debated piece of music nonetheless, and he uses it to argue for new different interpretations. This brings up another important point: speculative theory is not something we engage in because it is neither interesting nor fruitful. A lot of our work is tied to specific pieces and repertoires.

I rarely speak about music theory with non-musicians because I know they won't get it and nobody would gain anything from the conversation. If I was a chemist, I'm sure my attitude would be the same with non-chemists. When it does happen, I try to avoid technical terms or at least define them in as simple a manner as possible. I've had it happen where I'm auditioning a bassist for a band or something and I say, "Let's take it from the G minor section," and their eyes glaze over and they go, "What?", but that's because pop musicians historically [are resistant to learning even the most rudimentary concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH9l8KlcuBA). I'm not a dick about it, I sing or play the beginning of their part and they go, "Got it."

Jazz doesn't need to swing, doesn't need acoustic instruments, doesn't need composition even. The best way to tell you is for you to listen. 

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WojNaU4-kI) is generally classified as jazz, actually, the first jazz recording.

It eventually started sounding more like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enijgnO_UA8), but I'm skipping a lot in between.

While big bands were popular, a lot of the musicians were also doing their thing in smaller settings, in some cases doing a lot more advanced things (not that big bands weren't advanced, but smaller groups had more space to really open up). [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y9dZk-GMiM) is a particular gem of the era before bebop, Don Byas literally destroying rhythm changes. Now, little explaining. You probably know about Charlie Parker, and this duet recording was done in 1945, the same year Parker made Koko and other famous recordings. Note, that Don Byas was born in 1912, Parker in 1920. This is probably not noticeable, but is a huge deal to hear someone of Byas' age play this way. Byas was closer to the generation of Lester Young (tenor player in Count Basie's band) and who did *not* play this way. 

Anyways, here's [Koko by Charlie Parker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wGJpbPKbz8). This is where jazz today is founded on. Many musicians look more to the past than this, but this is where you can say it all starts.

More explaining. Charlie Parker was the poster child for bebop. Not the only great musician in this style, arguably not the greatest to *ever* do it, but was about the first one to do it at such a high level (I personally prefer Sonny Stitt as far as playing and vocabulary, he came a little after Parker and took a lot from him). 

Koko is a really weird tune. Let's back up a bit. There's a tune composed by Ray Noble called [Cherokee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXw6rytCZw) it's technically a 64 bar tune, but follows the format of a 32 bar tune, AABA, 8 bars per section (in this case 16 bars per section, but it goes by pretty fast). Anyways, Cherokee had some pretty tough set of chord changes to improvise over in the bridge, so it became popular, as jazz musicians wanted a challenge. 

Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, a trumpeter he often played with, had this session where they wanted to play Cherokee. The common thing to do when playing tunes like this was to play the "head", or the full 32 (or 64, or whatever bar melody), then improvise over that same form. A full run-through of that form is called a chorus, and musicians would take chorus upon chorus over a tune. On a recording, you couldn't play too much because of techological limitations, so tempo became a way to play more choruses (faster tempos, more choruses). Koko is very weird, in the sense that they don't play the "head". There's a sort of melody: 4 bars of something written, 4 bars of a trumpet improvisation, 4 bars of saxophone improvisation, then 4 more bars of something written. Then Parker comes running out the gates with a solo over the changes of Cherokee, and they follow this form until the end, where they do the same form as the beginning, 4 bars of written music, 4 bars of trumpet, 4 bars of saxophone, then they end 2 bars into the last section. So Koko was very weird in that way. 

Anyways, the kind of playing you hear in this recording is the "vocabulary" that really makes jazz things jazz. Arpeggios up and down the chord changes, a sort of specific time feel, a unique approach to rhythm.

From there on, it's not easy to explain what happened. I'll just list a bunch of things that are jazz below.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-11-27 23:23:59 Jongtr<br>Famous story about John Coltrane.  He was notorious in Miles Davis's group for playing really long solos.  When questioned he explained "sometimes I just don't know how to stop."  Miles replied "Try taking the fucking horn outa your mouth."  

Seriously - assuming the players knows how to end ;-) - it's usually done by signals of some kind, eye contact or a nod, which works even while the soloist is still playing.  Same thing when handing over to the next soloist.    
Sometimes - if in doubt, eg in a jam - and having a spare hand - the sign is a pat on the head (one's own head!) to signal the "head" or "top".  I've also seen an upward finger point (index, not middle :-D) to indicate the same thing.  
Obviously this means you need to be careful with other eye contact: generally when one player looks at another it means "your turn", "take over", or sometimes "join in", eg to take fours or duet (the difference with the latter, of course, is that the first player keeps playing).

It's made a lot simpler, of course, if an agreed number of choruses each is set beforehand.  E.g., in a blues the convention is two choruses each.  The next player would be ready after two choruses, but wouldn't begin if the previous player (inspired!) was clearly carrying on into a third.  

Another convention is that bass and drum solos usually come last, so the head would always follow the drum solo- which usually sticks to the form same as the other solos - so an important skill for all players is to be able to count through the drum solo.  (In a free drum solo, the drummer would play a recognised pattern to finish, or just count into the head.)   Bass and drums don't always choose to play solos, and again that's decided by eye contact - often a simple shake of the head.

If you've been learning classical harmony this is exactly the sort of music you've worked on. I'd write somewhat polyphonically, because you're never going to be singing the same syllable.

If you're using existing arrangements, a more modern tune that was written as a duet would be cool (Fairy Tale in New York?).

I'm not a big Opera (Oratorio, Cantata, etc.) person, but are Arias ever called "Arias"? I think they usually or at least traditionally have titles, like "Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen" is the name of the "Queen of the Night Aria" from The Magic Flute.

I mean, the score doesn't say "Queen of the Night Aria".

The famous "Flower Duet" from Lakme is "Sous le dôme épais".

Some modern composers might actually name their arias "the something aria" or something like that, but you don't need to call it anything in terms of what it is. Give it a title.

If it becomes famous, that's when others might refer to it as "the duet from X cantata" or whatever they might say.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2018-12-10 10:01:07 TaigaBridge<br>I would say they almost never have "titles" but they do tend to become known by their first lines.

The title page of  my Zauberflöte score says "14. Arie. Königin der Nacht. Die Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen." The page of the score where the aria actually starts says simply "14. Arie."

Similarly, "7. Duett" in the score, "7. Duett. Papagena u. Pamina: Bei Männern welche Lieben fühlen" on the title page.

A simple aria/duet/trio/quartet, or a simple labeling of the form of the song (you will see 'ballade', 'cavatina' etc), is all that is needed.

Another more modern term perhaps would be a mashup, but to me that one involves combining more elements than just the melody of two different songs.

Another option (that's a bit of a stretch in my opinion) is a quodlibet, a baroque genre that combined melodies from a bunch of popular music. While this is similar I don't think that's entirely the right term.

At least for eighteenth century opera, duets have their own characteristic "scripts" that they follow. One of which is that the person who leads proposes a set of thematic ideas (we call it a "rotation") that the responder runs through again. This may be an exact repetition, or a sequential repetition, etc. But yeah, because duets have their own set of "genre norms," things that they do in a certain order.

But I actually *do* know of a duet that does this. [This one](https://youtu.be/svLFzbjjpQw). It's only a brief moment with the opening part of the rotation, but the entrance of Mandane really stands out as this minor-charged moment. So since we know this is sort of going against a generic norm for more exact repetition, we have a basis for making an interpretation. "Sad" is one way of doing it. But I also think there's a since in which it's staging Mandane as starting "far away" from Arbace, and the fact that she slides into a more exact repetition as the rotation goes on is one way that she "comes closer" to him. And that plays out in miniature the whole narrative of the aria, where the two start far away and come closer and closer together. So I think this is enacting that narrative "in miniature" as it were. Of course, these things can have multiple dimensions, so I'm not saying that this is the only thing it means. Just that it's one aspect of the effect that I think is pretty cool!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-01-08 10:17:28 nmitchell076<br>Kinda! Though it can change based on what you are talking about. When I talked about the rotation in the duet, I was really referring to something analogous to the Primary Theme of a sonata form. It's just this theme tends to be repeated in duets and can be modified, so we can think about it as itself a rotation. 

So sort of like "phrase" or "unit" or "form," it can apply to things of many different sizes.

Have them get a capo, put it on capo 5 and all the ukulele chords are the same  chord names on guitar. This will come in handy when they want to learn triads later down the line. I generally try to teach any pop song with am, f and c. Stay with me by Sam Smith is a usual for me. These chord shapes are so much easy and it gets them playing along with a song quickly which the parents love. I also like to tab out popular songs so they can work on playing melody. Really handy for Christmas songs and then I can play chords under the students melody for a duet. Young students are a struggle but if they actually practice and improve, it’s awesome. Otherwise you’re just babysitting. I mainly teach piano but I’ve had a student for 18 months that doesn’t have a piano and comes to my studio. I honestly have no idea what we’re doing since he can’t practice but we work on scales, a lesson book and an easy song. If the parents want to waste that money, I’ll keep teaching that lesson. But man is it one of my least favorite lessons. Goes by so slow.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-02-15 00:06:50 Arvidex<br>Well, it depends on what kind of piece you are writing/arranging. In my understanding, the most straight forward kind of piece to arrange would be a preferably older (classical, maybe romantic, newer works fine as well, but particularly 20'th century modernism starts to become quite difficult) orchestral piece. You would just handle it as a reduction but with bigger range and more textural possibilities. The biggest differense between a normal piano duet and a piano four-hands arrangement is the tonal range each player is restricted to due to physical interaction and obstruction. If you study piano duets pieces by Mozart, a lot of quite funny and playful interaction goes on where the pianists take over each other parts or form a melody by filling in notes for each other. Doing this on the same keyboard needs and extra step in thought. Now I'm arranging an anime theme for piano four hands, and I'm not very well versed in more popular piano arrangements, so this is the first barrier I have to overcome. The first of the other two main things is how to really bring out the melody while still making both players play virtuosically and impressively at most times when constricted to a the "single" timbre of a piano. The last thing is writing it in such a way that justifies it being A) played by four hands and B) played on one keyboard. I need to write it in such a way that it's simply worse if it was tried to be played by one person and it needs to use the interesting mechanics that is born from the restriction of one single keyboard.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-02-15 01:37:32 reckless150681<br>Fascinating that there isn't a book on 4-hand.

If you're looking for tips, tricks, other examples, check out Frank and Zach duets on YouTube, or Victor Borge's Hung 2 duet for an example in comedic performance.

Apart from that, I think you should be more or less okay in considering arranging for 4-hand as literally that: imagine you're arranging for General Grievous. If you imagine numbering the hands low to high as 1 through 4, then you know that hands 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4 can cross like a normal two-handed pianist. But General Grievous' outer hands can't really cross. 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 4 can't really cross.

Everything else is an exercise in reduction for piano, though, as you've noticed, there are more possibilities for introducing color and other moving lines.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-03-13 07:26:17 65TwinReverbRI<br>I've not heard Klaatu, but The Beatles are definitely a band that really was the sum of all parts - the distinct personalities and playing styles.

Now, caveat there - of course there were "Beatles songs" and then there were "Lennon songs" and "McCartney songs" and "Harrison songs" and those each had they're own unique style.

So it depends on what era you're talking about, and whether it's more of an individual's song or the groups. Probably, Revolver and Rubber Soul (but I'd include Help and Hard Day's Night) mark the point where they are still "a band" and the "most Beatle-y" they were in that form (as the earliest music is not as different from that of early Stones and Who, and Kinks, and Animals, and Gerry and The Pacemakers, Freddie and the Dreamers, etc.)

One of the primary standouts to me are the vocals - in fact I just heard "If I Fell" today and they're in harmony, then John jumps up to follow Paul in unison, then jumps down again at the end of the phrase. Then in the Bridge John is often on a static note while Paul goes above - and they're fairly far apart.

But this vocal harmony, and vocal interplay is very important - think about "Nowhere Man" with it's parallel 3 part chords, versus something like "Taxman" with the wider spread, and then "Norwegian Wood" with the parallel duet ('she asked me to sit'). The other facet of this is the backing parts like in "In My Life", where vocals are doubled in harmony, then followed "oohs". When you look at something like "Help" with the "echo" backing vocals in the verse, then you've got pretty much all the stuff they typically do (contrast this with "Blackbird" which is essentially a Paul solo song, and he doubles his voice in unison and IIRC there's no other harmonies or other members singing at all).

Musically speaking, unique chord progressions are the order of the day.

I was just messing with "I Want You" the other day - the intro is Dm - Dm/F - E7b9 - Bb7 (!) A7(b13). All of the chords keep the F note on top. And what's interesting is the move from C to B to Bb to get to the Bb chord - we could call all this a V/V going to Neapolitan, which also goes to V (or a TTsub for E leading to the A) but it's just all a little "weird".

Then I was messing with "Sun King":

E - F#m - G#m7 (or E6?) - E6

C (!) - Cmaj7 - Gm - A7

C - Cmaj - C7 - F

Some of those are just weird. It's even the same with stuff like "Day Tripper" where it starts of with what is basically a "blues progression" and a lick, then it moves to F#7 - A7 - G#7 - C#7 - B7

Just kind of unusual moves.

That alone won't do it, but there are comparatively few songs (again, maybe more of the earlier "rock and roll" might not, but even some early songs do) that don't have some "unusual" chord changes so I'd have to say that's a hallmark of their compositional style.

One thing a lot of people don't know - The Beatles had a great way of making transitions from one section to the next - I'll have to ponder some of the tunes I'm thinking of but I'm not just talking stark moves like in the Polythene Pam medley, but more how one section sort of becomes the next or just "falls right into" the next section in their middle period stuff.

Besides maybe doing some little meter things like a 2/4 measure or shortened or lengthened phrase, they also did some neat things like like the "fussing and fighting my friends" in "We Can Work it Out" where, IIRC they use quarter note triplets in relation to the previous measure length, so it comes out like they went to 3/4 but the measure length is the same - they did this a couple of times IIRC.

Also a STRONG sense of melody - especially from Paul. If you don't have this, don't even try :-) While there are songs like "I am the Walrus" where John pretty much sings monotone for  a lot of the phrase, if you compare this with something like "I Will" from the White Album - Paul's vocal melody is all over the place - but very melodic and tuneful.

My personal belief is that, besides riding on the coat-tails of their fame, the reason so many Jazz artists did instrumental versions of Beatles tunes where because there was such strong melody.

Honestly, most people don't even come close (and this is one of the reasons it bothers me so much that people on this forum are so all about chord progression and just seem to be totally ignoring melody).

From a playing standpoint, the two guitar interplay is important, and the 12 string plays a prominent role especially in the earlier albums - but it does give it "that sound". Then of course the use of Piano pretty consistently, or if not, Harpsichord, or sometimes Electric Piano (and then all the later stuff like Mellotron but that starts to go beyond the "core" of at least that central style).

But Paul again is the musician's musician in the group - he plays bass like he sings - extremely melodically. In fact, way underrated as a bass player. He is all over a lot of the songs. It provides harmonic foundation, melodic motion, and rhythmic force all at the same time. Think about how the bass moves at the end of the vocal phrase in "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds". "Penny Lane" - he's all over the place - tuned down IIRC.

Of course it turned out that Paul also played much of the Guitar, Drums, and Keys on a lot of the songs as well, but really what's individualistic is his bass playing.

And finally, a sense of humor. A sense of "not taking yourselves too seriously". Sarcasm, sardonic wit, not afraid to goofy, not afraid to do a cover, etc.

Nothing that would help identify the pitch, no. Given a single note, I'd visualize it based on timbre. 

&gt;Or, does it only happen when you know what the note's letter is? 

If one pitch was played, and you told me it was G, then whether or not it's actually a G, I would visualize a gold-er version of how what the timbre alone would make me visualize.

&gt;that knowledge of the letter or number gives you a color/sensation, but note the note itself 

I would have to conclude that yes, my alphanumeric synesthesia bleeds into my sound-to-visual synesthesia. 

&gt;So that would imply it's not based on sound, but the "label" you put on it. 

There are different levels of thinking about a song, and for me, each of those levels manifests visually in their own ways.

I can listen to a song with timbre in mind, and then associate the sum of all the voices and their rhythms with a colorful collage that morphs over time.

Or if for example listening to a duet, I would imagine each voice as a continuous shape, textually/structurally affected by timbre, and colored by my association with whatever scale degree is being played.

If listening to something with more harmonic context and thus a clearer harmonic definition at any time, I start to hear the song with theory and Roman numerals in mind. But whether chords named by note/quality, or chords indicated by Roman numerals, when I listen to music while focusing on the theory, this alphanumeric synesthesia outweighs the actual audio/visual and timbral synesthesia. The alphanumeric side dominates when I'm actively listening, and likewise the timbral side when passively listening.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-06-09 23:04:55 BRNZ42<br>There's two different uses of the word harmony. I think understanding that will clear up all your confusion. 

1. **Harmony** is any time two or more different pitches are sounding at the same time. In a choir, one voice is singing the melody of the song, while the other voices provide "the harmony." Or when two flutes play a duet, and they're on different pitches, they're "in harmony."
2. The chords to a piece are its **harmony.** Going from one type of chord to another type of chord is called **harmonic motion.** How fast chords change is called **harmonic rhythm.** It's kind of a catch-all word used to talk about the chords of a song. 

It's the second definition that explains why arpeggios can *imply* harmony, because the word "harmony" here just means "the chords of the tune." Even with just a single melodic voice, we can often hear what the chords *would be* if there were some chords being played. That's why the harmony (definition 2) is implied, even if there no harmony (definition 1).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-07-03 05:30:12 65TwinReverbRI<br>First of all, you need a MODEL - an existing piece, or number of pieces that you can model your piece after.

I would say, you could to a Piano piece, or a Piano and Violin duet as the easiest things.

I agree about FORM - however, I might suggest a simple 3 part form that goes A - B - A - some music, some varied music, then a repeat of the original music.

It's a pretty basic formula (Ternary Form) without getting into all the intricacies of Rounded Binary and other, more complex forms.

A Simple Binary (A B) form could be good too, but most of us like that feeling of "coming back" to the A section material, so all you do is tack on the opening A section at the end after the B.

You might try a simple Waltz, in "melody with accompaniment" style.

Here is an EXCELLENT type of piece to try to write:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aspcdJ8Nz0c

The melody doesn't have to have all the chromatic notes, nor the fancy triplets or quintuplets and all the little trills and other ornaments, but notice how the Left Hand simply does the same basic pattern throughout, with only a change at the end of a phrase.

One of the big problems a lot of new composers run into is they try to throw everything they can think of into a single piece, and that's not really how music is written.

Here we have a simple A Minor melody in the RH (it never even plays and chords really) and a simple very repetitive accompaniment in the LH (always the same basic pattern that just goes through the harmony - and that's because the real interest is in the melody).

The form here is pretty obvious - 8 measure phrase (could be 4 measure sub-phrases as there is a "mid point" in the melody). It's repeated (on page 2). This would be your A section.

Then there's a new section - your B section - another 8 bars repeated (this time with repeat bars) where the melody is a little "busier" (though the LH still pretty much remains the same). Then the A section returns.

You could just end there, or with a repeated A, and have a nice "little piece" in A B A form.

That's all it really takes, and all you should really try to accomplish.

If you'd like to make it for Piano and Violin, you could just break up the Piano into Bass Note LH, and chords RH - which would be appropriate for Children to play, and then give the Violin the Melody.

For a little more advanced piece, you could maybe have the Violin do Pizzicato notes on the down beat, or as the beat 2 and 3 chords (and it could even play double stops if you wanted to get slightly more advanced) while the RH piano does the melody.

You could have the Violin play the melody and the piano go accompaniment as before, or you could trade them off section by section. That adds a little more interest without the music getting any more difficult to play.

Then sing the major scale downward starting from this note until you find the root note (= more stable one). The trick is too sing your major scale over the track, so you are sure of every note being in the key (you won't be starting from the tonic every time so don't try to force it !)

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, always carry a  tuning fork with you and **voilà** you can identify any keys and any note in a given key ("oh he just sing the third over the tonic chord")  !

Hearing relationship of note to chords (and key) in more important imo than absolute pitch. Maybe you should work on degree identification in major scale. (singing major scale over drone is a good start).

Now, I was fortunate to have (eventually) full instrumentation (except for double reeds), so here's what I used as my guideline:

* If the group has tons of flutes, write a second (lower) flute part.
* The oboe can double Flute 1 an octave lower
* 2 clarinet parts: keep the second part under the break, as usually clarinet II players are weaker than those playing Clarinet I.  (This is why it's helpful to actually know how to play an instrument!) Note: in my band, the best clarinet player played first chair on Clarinet I, and the 2nd best player played first chair Clarinet II.
* Have separate F horn/alto sax parts. In many arrangements they're doubled, but I've found it tends to put the horns a tad high throughout. In other words, think of these 2 parts as duet partners, with alto saxes on part I and the horns on part II. 
* 1 trombone part. Be careful about writing passages that require them to move more than 3 positions quickly.  Also, many young players can't yet reach 7th position--so no low B naturals!
* A separate baritone/euphonium part that doubles with tenor sax.
* Give the bass line to the tuba, bari sax, bassoon, alto and bass clarinet. 
* AS u/Beeb294 suggested, write LOTS of percussion parts (snare, bass, timpani, cymbals, maybe bells, auxiliary percussion).  In younger bands, there always seems to be lots of 'drummers' so it's good to give as many as possible something to play--else they're going to get into trouble if they're just sitting around twiddling their thumbs. LOL

&amp;#x200B;

As to the chart itself:

* As others have pointed out, keep the key in concert F, Bb, or Eb. Transpose if you need to.
* Simplify rhythms. Depending on how advanced they are, syncopation may be a challenge. Forget quarter-note triplets for now. But don't be afraid to use a new rhythm--as long as you teach them how to play it.
* As much as possible, be aware of the range of each part. Flutes can play easily above the staff, as can the saxes, but it'll kill your brass section.
* As you write chords, you can keep the harmonies tighter as you move up higher in pitch. Keep the spacing wide in the bass clef: maybe just the chord roots in octaves, or maybe just root and 5th. Don't put the chordal 3rd too low.
* Occasionally give the melody--or interesting part--to the lower instruments.  The flutes don't *always* have to have the melody!
* Do study what other arrangers have done and listen to the chart if possible. It might look good in the score, but will it sound good?

Hope you'll find some of this useful.

- the only rule of atonal music is to avoid any semblance of tonality. Why? To explore new sound worlds and boldly go where no man has gone before. 
- since linearity always reminds people of tonal melody, 12-tone or otherwise atonal “lines” frequently sound stupid. So don’t write lyrical melodies. 
- to avoid lyricism, use large intervals, asymmetrical rhythms, and unusual articulation. Also irregular phrases. 
- avoid graphic notation or improvised parts- players tend to revert to tonal memes. 
- solo instrumental writing is extremely difficult and kind of pointless. Which is a shame because you can get it performed… a solo is always a “melody” which means the brain implies lyricism. A duet is at least a “conversation.”
- PC sets are useful, but never be shy about breaking rules to make something sound better. The row is a tool not a rule. 
- Use dynamics, rhythms, and articulation to craft events and put them in what seems to be a logical order. Keep everything that is emotional and cut everything else. 
- if you are ever tempted to make it sound tonal, stop and go play some pretty music on piano or guitar or whatever. Get ur fix elsewhere. An atonal sound world must have integrity. Just like Mozart.  
I really think the chromatic scale is holding us back. Our ears enjoy the upper overtones and they are detuned. Blue notes in jazz, distortion in rock guitar, the abandonment of harmony in hip hop. Ears are bored with common practice harmony.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-08-10 05:30:40 65TwinReverbRI<br>Composition major here, music theory teacher, music professor still...

Firstly, one of the things I have often caught myself doing is trying to "force" more things in than are really necessary.

This came mostly from me trying to emulate what I **thought** music did, rather than **knowing** what music did - either because I hadn't played enough or studied it critically enough.

This often happens to beginners as well who feel the need to have "thick chords with lots of notes" as well as "complex" music - I suppose there's a fear that if you don't write enough notes your music will be "too simple" or "not complex enough".

However what I really learned by paying a lot more attention to the **Musical Textures** that various composers wrote was that sometimes, just the melody by itself is all you need.

Sometimes it seems like some melodies "demand" very complex accompaniments, and others very simple accompaniments. And sometimes either will be OK.

What I would suggest is for you to try to "set" this melody in as many different ways as you can think of.

Firstly, by itself.

Secondly, with just a single bass line, maybe just the roots of the chords, and no "inner" parts.

There is such a thing as "outer voice counterpoint" or "Soprano-Bass Counterpoint" so rather than just imply harmony with your bass line, it could also form it's own "melodic stream" either with just whole measure values - but implying inversions and so on along with the harmony.

However it could also "outline" the harmony (and include inversions if you like) by moving in quarter notes or even doing counter-rhythms and so on.

Think about this very carefully: If you look at your first measure, it REALLY strongly implies an Em chord.

So **do you really need any other supporting voices?** You can certainly have them if you want, but for me personally I like to "justify" things I do - so I don't put notes in "just because they can". When I write I want every note to have intent - a "purpose" so to speak.

IOW, while an E in the bass might be necessary harmonically, something else about the musical texture might give it a purpose for being there - maybe it's for Violin and Cello duet.

If the texture you *really* wanted was block chord triads, well, you have that.

Then you can also decide if you really need or want 3, or 4 parts. IOW, don't just write 4 parts becuase that's what you hear about all the time. It's WAY over-represented in theory discussions. 2 part counterpoint and 3 part counterpoint are very common, as are 2 and 3 part "harmonic" writing - more of melody with accompaniment as opposed to counterpoint.

Think about this for a second: How different would this melody be if you played a 3 beat E, then F#, just like you have your bass line, say for Violin and Cello, versus playing this on Piano with broken octaves (low E high E low E high E, etc.) in 8th notes?

Totally different feel.

So you also have to decide those kinds of things - or experiment with them.

Which is why I suggest setting this in as many different ways as you can think of (and look at other pieces for examples).

_______

Another thing you need to work out is if you want to adhere strictly to an archaic style, or if you want to do a "looser" modernistic style.

The ii^o chord would be in first inversion in the Common Practice Period, however, there are many elements about your melody that are "against the rules" of Common Practice Period writing.

So why are you worried about the ii when your melody is full of astylistic things?

See the problem here is, if you REALLY want to write like that music you REALLY need to study it IN GREAT DETAIL.

That comes from listening to it, playing it, analyzing it, and really really really digging into the specifics.

What you have instead is what a lot of people do - you have the "surface" elements - things you **think** "sound like" what you've heard, but actually have issues.

Yet like a lot of people you're kind of hung up on these other "rules" of harmony - this is such a super common thing - if you want to write stylistically accurate music, you have to follow ALL of the rules, not just the ones you pick, or only the ones you've learned about not knowing there are others, and furthermore, not knowing that these rules don't apply to other styles.

Now, as a beginner, yeah, you have to learn one thing at a time, so that's fine. But my point is, don't get too hung up on the "rules" and instead go to the MUSIC to write music.

Look at what other composers would do with a melody like this.

This is not a "Chorale Melody" - a Hymn Tune - so you're not going to be able to write 4 part chorale style parts to it very easily. It doesn't lend itself well to that.

It might lend itself well to Initiative Counterpoint, and really the place to start with that is a canon (though canons are written a measure at a time, though it could just be an imitative thing and not a strict canon).

Here are a couple of examples of the first 4 measures set in different textures:

https://musescore.com/user/32723609/scores/5670397

Note that these are simply examples, not meant to be "exactly like Bach would do" or anything like that, nor would these be necessarily what I'd do with this, but just to give you some ideas to work from without "writing it for you" so to speak.

The first is Canoncic/Imitative, the second "Murky Bass" or Broken Octaves, the third Bass and Inner part, and the last more like a "walking bass" that outlines the chords (didn't always stick to your harmonies but stayed close).

Hope this helps.

What on earth are you writing then? This would be a lot easier if you provided an example.

&gt;VisuallyI think it looks better to have 8va over the whole staff, to retain the standard SATP two parts per staff look, with specific 'loco' or the at pitch lower part, compared to changing the system layout, or excessive ledger lines.

Cart before the horse much? Ledger lines are preferable to octave signs most of the time. And if you have more than an octave between two adjacent parts, you're not following SATB rules anyway.

&gt;Doesn't 65wint have actual engraving experience?!:)

Seems like a moot point. I do too. ;) Where does that leave you?

No notation manual talks about this because it's bonkers. I'm looking at [Gould (2011)](https://www.amazon.com/Behind-Bars-Definitive-Guide-Notation/dp/0571514561/) (the current standard), [Stone (1980)](https://www.amazon.com/Music-Notation-Twentieth-Century-Practical/dp/0393950530) and [Nicholl/Grudzinski (2007)](https://www.amazon.com/Music-Notation-Preparing-Scores-Parts/dp/0876390742/). The only reference to this practice I can find is in [Clinton Roemer - The Art of Music Copying (1973)](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Music-Copying-Clinton-Roemer/dp/B000KTREQ4), and only in relation to a conductor part, "a highly condenser and compressed version of the score... made for arrangements to be used in night clubs, concerts and book shows, for stage band publications, and so on." (195) It's important to note that nobody actually plays off this part; it's there so that the conductor doesn't have to turn as many pages as they would with a full score. Conductor parts usually don't have all the notes, might have unconventional shorthands (like this 8va/loco thing... *maybe*; read on), and are used mostly to highlight entrances. Roemer doesn't even use the notation like you're talking about. [Here it is.](https://i.imgur.com/xUEKu3P.png) In that image, he even says "instruments should be written where they sound." And these are some of the guidelines to those parts:

-

&gt;&gt;1. Conductor parts for simple instrumental arrangements can most often be written on a single line.

&gt;&gt;2. **For more complex arrangements, it is better to use a braced part utilizing both treble and bass clefs. In this type of part, it becomes possible to write all Instruments where they sound.**

&gt;&gt;3. Occasionally a vocal arrangement will require a three system part because of a duet that cannot be written on one vocal line, or because of a complicated orchestral part that requires two lines. Also, instrumental conductor parts for symphonic size orchestras often demand that a three, or even four system part be written. In all of these cases, 12-stave paper should be used.

-

&gt;That's what I was looking for, that centuries-old experience of engraving notation.

It sounds to me like you would be better off looking for sensible solutions to your easily fixable notation problems. Having edited manuscripts and engraved scores dating back to the 1500s, I can tell you that there's a lot of shitty, nonstandardized notation out there. But you do you, boo. A good rule to go by (although not always the best rule) is that if you see it in an engraved score from the 19th century, you can do it too. Good luck on that one.

&gt;I took a masterclass recently in medieval/Renaissance organ music, and she mentioned the transition from movable type, to copper engraving, in the 16th century scores:) Interesting topic....she showed a score (the new at the time copper engraving) where beaming occurred, which wasn't possible (shwith movable type music notation. The 8th notes had a combination of flags and beams. Really nice looking

I think there might be some confusion going on because the iconic part of the whole new world duet IMO is “a whole new world”/“don’t you dare close your eyes”, which is call and response. But I think OP is actually talking about when Jasmine *imitates* “a whole new world”, like at the very end.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-08 18:38:10 MaggaraMarine<br>Even if there's just one instrument playing a melody, there will still (most likely) be implied chords. The melody will emphasize certain notes that will be heard as the chord tones. They aren't necessarily root notes, though. For example if I wrote a melody that went G E G E F D E C, you would hear that as C - G7 - C. The G E in the beginning would imply C major, the F D would imply G7 and the E C would imply C major again. It takes some knowledge of how functional harmony works and what is common and what isn't. The melody could of course also imply Em Dm C progression, but that's really not how you would hear it if you just listened to the melody.

I would suggest starting from harmonizing simple melodies with the three basic chords (I, IV and V7). That's how you learn how melody and these basic chord functions work together, and you'll start recognizing certain melodic lines that imply certain chords. (And you'll also start recognizing these changes by ear.)

An important thing to understand is harmonic rhythm, which means how often the chords change. Usually a piece follows a certain kind of harmonic rhythm - you usually don't have a progression where one chord lasts 3 measures, then suddenly you have 4 chord changes in one measure, then two chords in a measure, or something random like that. Usually it's either one chord per bar or two chords per bar (sometimes one chord per two or four bars, especially if it's in a faster tempo), and it stays this way most of the time. (Of course sometimes the harmonic rhythm changes, but it usually stays fairly similar throughout the section.) When you understand this, you can kind of expect when the chords are going to change, and you don't have to analyze every single note as a part of some new chord.

Using your ears and being familiar with the sound of different chords is pretty much the most important thing. You will hear the changes when you listen to the melody if you are familiar with the sound of the different chords. And when you read the sheet music, you will hear the melody in your head. Using your ear is the most important thing - you don't understand music just by looking at it on paper and treating it as some kind of a puzzle that you can solve just by looking at the notes. You understand how notes relate to each other by listening to the sounds. What I would suggest is playing the melody slowly on piano and then just trying chords behind it. Of course use your knowledge of functional harmony and analyze the melody - figure out what are the most important notes and which notes are just passing tones. If there are scale degrees 2, 4 and 5 in the melody, you know that those are in the V7 chord, so it's probably going to sound good over those notes.

Also, learn what are the most characteristic notes of the different chords. I would say emphasizing the leading tone (7th scale degree) pretty much always implies a V7 chord. The 2nd and 4th scale degrees are also a good indication of a V7 chord. The 3rd scale degree is a characteristic note of the tonic chord, especially when used in combination with the 5th scale degree or the tonic. The characteristic notes of the subdominant chord are the 4th and 6th scale degrees (most importantly the 6th because it's not included in any of the other basic chords).

I would say, don't expect the melody to emphasize the root of the chord. Usually the first thing people do when they start harmonizing the melody is assume that the first note in the bar is the root of the chord. So for example in the key of C when they see a melody that goes G E G E, they think it's a G7 chord because it starts on G. Or if they see a melody that goes F D F D, they think it's an F major chord because it starts on F. But G E would more likely imply a C major chord and F D would more likely imply a G7 chord. Especially if the F and D move down to E and C, it's pretty clearly a dominant - tonic progression.

Now, if there is a bass player, you would expect the bass to emphasize roots of the chords a lot of the time. Then again, in a duet, the bass may also play a bit more notes than it would play if there was a full band. But again, try to hear where the chords change. Then see what notes are emphasized, and that's your chord.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-09-27 00:22:09 Brauhm<br>Those are both really good places to start. Harmonies are dynamic and my writers use them differently. For example, if it's a simple pop song, you might have parallel thirds. But if it's a duet with a soprano and a tenor, the tenor could sing the fifth under (also known as an inversion) which is a perfect fourth. This is an important distinction because even though it's the same note, the interval has changed. By learning, both minor and major thirds, fourths, fifths, and sixths, you'll be able to "hear" 99% of vocal harmonization, and from there can extend further!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-03 08:04:12 victotronics<br>Hm. Writing a four voice piano piece and then designating it violin/cello with continuous double stops doesn't make it a violin/cello piece. Take a listen (and a look!) to actual duets. It is quite possible to have a duet with just two melody lines. The baroque is full of duets for two flutes or two recorders etc.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-22 10:13:57 65TwinReverbRI<br>An Ostinato is a more academic term for a *pattern* that keeps repeating. It is usually an identifiable rhythmic and melodic pattern, that could be just a melodic line or chord progression.

However, it's a little silly to call all the parts in "Play That Funky Music (White Boy)" "ostinati". 

Ostinati more appropriately appear in classical type music where such things are kind of exceptions rather than the rule (aside from a few specific forms).

Even there, things like an Andalusian Cadence, or a Passamezzo we don't call "Ostinato". They are, but we call them by their names.


A Vamp is generally a chord or two (or a few) pattern that is, yes, an Ostinato, but generally something designed to be an accompaniment - usually for improvisation. So the classic i - IV chord Dorian Vamp is a Vamp, but, we don't call "Oye Como Va" a "vamp" (or an ostinato) even though it uses the same two chords in alternation the whole song. We might say it's basically a Vamp (and never an Ostinato unless you want to come off as nerdy/snooty/overly academic) but we just then mean the chord progression idea the song is built on, not the song itself.

A Loop is just a pattern repeated - 4 bar loop. Ok, they are Ostinati as well, and Vamps as well. But we're talking about modern music production where it's literally the same 4 beats or bars repeated and more specifically done electronically - by a looper pedal or in a DAW rather than played live (older idea of a Tape Loop excluded). A "Drum Loop", a Looped Sample, etc. Sometime though, people refer to the unit to be looped as the loop, so it's not necessarily the process of repeating it. IOW, you can download a "drum loop" that's just a single measure - it's intended to be looped in some software but the thing itself is just a single iteration, and in that case not actually a Vamp or Ostinato.

This is like "feat." or "ft." now. I'm sorry, but the song is not "Tom Petty feat. Stevie Nicks". It's a Duet, or Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks. There was no "feat." back then and it doesn't need to be called that.

Ostinato is an old term for classical music, Vamp is a term that originated in Jazz, and a Loop is a modern term for 2000s music production in the pop world. That's really the main difference between them all - the genres you should use them in.

A Riff is something that's used in Jazz and Pop/Rock music that means a single idea. Usually it's an idea that is a main part of the song, and it too can be looped, or create a vamp, or yes, be an Ostinato.

But really, a Riff is a recognizable pattern - usually a melodic idea - that often forms a major part of the structure or is identifiable in some way. But again just a single iteration could be a Riff (get it confused with "Lick" now) so not necessarily a Loop, Vamp, or Ostinato.

Jazz players say Riff and Lick, but it's more rock guitar players who really took over the riff and riffing idea - "Whole Lotta Love" by Led Zepplin has "the main riff" pretty much through most of the song. It's super identifiable.

Does the song loop it.Yes. Is is an Ostinato? Yes. Is it a single chord Vamp? Yes, I suppose.

But we just call it a Riff. If you call it any of those other things people who work in that genre will look at you funny.

"So you loop the riff?" No. You repeat the riff.

"So it's an Ostinato". Go away college boy.

"So it's a one chord vamp then". This ain't jazz. Now only slightly tune your guitar and lets jam dude.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-22 18:02:19 T140V<br>&gt;This is like "feat." or "ft." now. I'm sorry, but the song is not "Tom Petty feat. Stevie Nicks". It's a Duet, or Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks.

Excellent post, very clear. Just one thing - I thought that the difference between a duet and a 'feat.' was that the duet was performed/recorded at the same time/place, but the 'feat.' was used where one artist's contribution was made at a separate time/place?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-10-26 03:20:45 65TwinReverbRI<br>Can't reinforce the enough.

Also, you need to STUDY those quartets you listen to.

Another mistake that beginning composers make u/Ablazeknight91 is to try to write a quartet when they haven't spent time writing for smaller forces - like Sax and Piano. If you haven't written "anything" really, you shouldn't start with trying to write a Sax Quartet.

Now, in my mind there's a difference between writing "A Saxophone Quartet" and "a piece in 4 parts that is playable by saxes".

You should absolutely take your 4 part assignments and transcribe them for 4tet and even try to get your friends to play them.

And if you're really serious, and have the horns or access to them, get a DAW and record what you're working on one part at a time - it's an experience that's worth its weight in gold.

But, IOW, don't set your sights on a whole piece for Sax Quartet until you've really kind of got a handle on basic Forms, Harmony, Melody, studied and played and listened to a lot of scores, and so on - because it will only end in frustration (or a really shitty piece you'll look back on later and go, "oh my god, how was I so naive" - because that's what we all do ;-)

IOW, try to shoot for maybe a short Sax Duet that's just a 16 bar binary form piece.

Or a solo sax Etude or Prelude.

IOW, the other big mistake people make is trying to (or wanting to) write a "Masterpiece" their first time out.

You have to start small, with small forces and smaller forms, shorter lengths, and things like that.

But that's how you learn to **craft** something really good - and then you start building on that.

You can learn a lot from these, if you like modern repertoire.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-11-19 14:43:05 65TwinReverbRI<br>Ok. The reason I asked is that usually with composition being able to play a "harmonic" instrument is important - Piano being the primary one, but guitar is not a bad substitute.

This is going to sound a bit harsh, but I want to throw out a little dose of reality here - I'm not saying this is exactly the position you're in - I don't have your entire musical training in front of me - but since I have a comp degree myself, and I see students coming into our program all the time, these are some "insights" I have:

Many people do come to composing "late" - that is, they've playing in band, orchestra, or choir since middle school, or taken piano in the same age range, and have starting writing their own stuff (or today, a lot of people are working in DAWs).

So very often, their composition experience is pretty limited coming in - very often there aren't even composition teachers where they live - sometimes a piano teacher is the best they can get.

Now, there's nothing wrong with that. But I would say that since you're a Junior now, you've essentially got 1.5 years to get your composing chops up to a good level to be able to get into the best school you can.

But I also want to caution, while anyone can take a composition degree for any reason - just to learn more about it for example - really, the "ideal" composition student is a person who just does little else than write music pretty much all the time. Or when they're not writing music, they're playing it, or working with people to play, and record, their music.

For example if we see a student come in from high school who's written a Piano an Violin duet, and had two friends play and record it, that's really impressive.

If we see a student come in with YASQ (yet another String Quartet) with no clue how to write for strings, who at best has a MIDI mockup of it which doesn't really  inform the person how real string players would play it, we're going to be less impressed. Now, we can't fault a person with fewer resources, but at the same time, a lot of people just don't take the initiative to do what they need to do.

IOW, they "dabble" in composition.

Music Degrees are actually very serious business. They're not for "dabblers". That's why so many people start in music performance, and then switch to music education. They find out that simply "liking playing violin in orchestra" is not enough to be a performance major. A Violin Performance major is for the person who lives and breathes everything Violin, and has realistic goals about what they want to do and is willing to work hard on how to get there.

Theory and Composition are no different, and in some ways even worse, because there are far fewer resources out there to get people early starts in those (though again, a later start is OK and even understood because of that, and because people should really spend their first years cultivating proficiency on an instrument).

Again, that's not to say you can't major in one of those degrees if you don't fit that profile - many people successfully complete the degree without that kind of investment. But they don't typically then put that degree to work for them.

There's another post hear tonight about Theory. I think the responses there will be very informative:

https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/dya47j/carrers_in_music_theory/

Your degree choice doesn't HAVE to be career motivated - again it can just be for general knowledge.

But, it's a lot of money to spend on that. And if it's not your money, you usually have some convincing to do :-)

Also, just FWIW, there's a lot of confusion out there about what "composing" is.

A Traditional Music Composition degree is going to focus on notated "classical" music - music for the concert stage meant generally to be performed by live performers. Many schools also include electronic music in this (not EDM, but "academic electronic music") but not so many of them consider "pop" music or even jazz as "composition". And very few consider "making beats" or anything like that to be "composing".

So it's very important to look at what kind of composition degree you want and what any school you're intending on attending offers/requires.

Ar my university, you'd have Voice as your major instrument, and you'd take even more Piano (4 semesters). You'd take 4 semesters of applied comp lessons, as well as the traditional theory/ear-training/history core, and then orchestration, counterpoint, form and analysis, etc. You'd also take Music Notation, Electronic Music, and Music Technology Survey.

The skillset a modern composer needs today is more varied than ever before, and there is or can be less emphasis on traditional orchestral composition, so things you can do to prepare if you're looking for a more diverse program:

Start composing every day. Lean to craft, and to hone. Learn that it's not all divine inspiration and there's a lot of work involved - a lot of drafts, sketches, rewrites, aborted ideas, and so on. The skill of composing is being able to craft something, not just write something on the first try (though sometimes that happens).

Start listening to the music you're planning to compose every day in any downtime when you can't compose. Learn as much classical repertoire as possible - every piano sonata by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, every symphony by Beethoven, and the later symphonies by Haydn and Mozart, , all their string quartets, all the "big name" things you hear about a lot - The Four Seasons, the Brandenburg Concerti, etc. - all the "greatest hits" - and then more. And do NOT not include modern music - you should be familiar with Debussy, Stravinsky, Bartok, all the way up to the moderns - Glass, Ligeti, etc. If you're into film music, now your rep - don't just go in with a knowledge of John Williams, or him and Howard Shore or something. Learn about Korngold, and Hermann, and all the other great film composers. If it's more slanted towards Jazz, then learn all your Big Band guys and the names of the great arrangers. Etc.

Learn to use Musecore, or Sibelius or Finale if you haven't already done so. If you have, learn them better. Notate all your stuff. A good looking, standardized, professional score is going to get more performances, have fewer mistakes in performance, and is going to be great on your resume and in your portfolio!

Learn some kind of Recording in a DAW - Pro Tools, Logic, even Garageband or Reaper. You should learn basic recording skills - you can sing duets, trios, or quartets by recording yourself - you don't need to master this (unless you're working towards a more DAW driven compositional style) but knowing how to record and being able to is going to help you hear what it is you're writing - especially if you can play it yourself or at least record others who can read through your music (in nice notation :-) for you.

Do take those piano lessons. But you need to get as much done as you can.

Same with voice lessons.

it wouldn't be a bad idea if you could ask your choir director if you could help with conducting sectionals, or if they wouldn't mind spending a little time teaching you how to direct a group of singers.

I would try to write a small piece or small set of pieces for a small group in your choir say 3 or 4 people you could get together that you can direct and have them perform your music.

If you don't have ideas for original music, or get stuck on a composition, don't be afraid to arrange other music - that's also a valuable learning tool (and inspirational one).

Honestly, while knowing some theory is great, we don't expect our incoming freshman to really know much beyond reading music, basic rhythm and pitch, key signatures and time signatures (most people coming in to college don't even know 6/8 is two beats per measure).

So the more you can do on this, great - if you can place out of some levels of theory you will be able to spend more time on other musical pursuits such as playing in additional ensembles.

But, I would spend the bulk of time on playing and writing, getting your notation, DAW, and piano skills up, and becoming the kind of vocalist that can pass a college entrance audition! 

I would say, by this summer, you should be seriously starting to work on your portfolio.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-12-05 04:30:58 improvthismoment<br>Well I'd say that you have to start somewhere. And for beginners who want to learn jazz, a piano-bass duet is a fantastic place to start.

I'd suggest starting with a blues like Now's the Time or Bag's Groove. Best to learn it by ear if possible (both melody and chords/bassline), and check a fakebook like The Real Book as a reference. The piano could go through the melody and maybe a very simple improvisation for a chorus or two, using the blues scale perhaps. The bass would play a walking bassline with mostly roots and chord tones. This would be a great beginner project in my opinion.

Have a listen, you can hear how the B (the turnaround) is the 7 that builds the tension, the f# is the 4, the 5 is the g#, but the g# is also the 3rd the the B, so they do this nice 4 bar loop, that gives duane the ability to pretty much play in the C# or the f# whenever he wants even if the piano and eric are doing other things.  Duane Allman plays (the song is a duet with eric) it so nice.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2019-12-21 22:30:58 Korrun<br>For a guitar example, Carter style arrangements are often done with the melody lower than most if not all of the chords. Here's an example: http://www.bluegrassguitar.com/studytune1.html

For a duet situation, the guitar melody in Wish you Were Here stays mostly in the same range as the rhythm part:

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-01-21 19:37:05 9spaceking<br>I’m a noob in comparison to you but I think what they’re trying to say is how the parts stack up together. For example chopins inventions have the melody echoed back and forth, similar to a canon. On the other hand a modern duet like A non love song/a love song has the two parts complementing and overlapping each other to show two different messages rather than one single theme.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-01-31 10:36:04 pingus3233<br>&gt;So the beam direction is something I wasn't sure about. I take it there aren't specific rules about it, and it's more of whatever looks neater/is less confusion? Having the direction depend on whether it's above or below the center line makes sense to me. 

So stem direction, generally if the note is below the middle line of the staff the stem should point up. Technically it should also be on the right side of the note head but for handwritten music it often falls somewhere towards the middle.

If the note is in the middle line of the staff or above the stem should generally point down, and the stem should be on the left side of the note head, but again, in handwritten music it often falls more towards the middle.

An example of where this rule might not apply is in two-voice polyphonic music on one staff (maybe a trumpet duet or something) where sometimes the top voice is written stem up and the bottom voice written stem down, and in that case sometimes the stems are shorter. I don't remember seeing this very often though.

&gt;And do slurs follow the same logic?

If the notes cross the middle line where stem direction changes then I generally tend to have the stems pointing the same direction but choose whichever direction looks best. Not a hard rule though, especially with phrases tied together with beams which might have the beam in the middle.

&gt;One thing I forgot: for piano pedal markings, there seems to be a specific type/lettering, is it important to try and mimic that, or can I just simply write it out legibly?

Eh, matter of personal taste, you can stylize it a bit to make it look like the "standard" font but make sure it's legible.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-26 18:57:17 LukeSniper<br>&gt;I imagine if a baritone and a soprano for example sang a duet together with similar melodies that at least one of them would have a hard time performing.

What makes you think that?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-26 23:25:40 DRL47<br>&gt;Because one of them would be out of their range when he tries to match the melody of the other,

This is the faulty part of your reasoning. The two parts in a duet DON'T match each other. They are in harmony (different notes) with each other.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-02-27 00:18:47 the_lemon_king<br>It's actually pretty rare to have a duet between two people of the *same* voice type compared to the reverse.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-01 23:44:56 FVmike<br>True, but they do indeed sometimes act as 1-3 2-4 units. Mahler did this quite a lot. There's a big duet in the fourth movement of his 3rd symphony for horns 1 and 3
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-19 11:29:27 65TwinReverbRI<br>If it's metal, you don't need contralto and tenor. We don't call them that. They're just singers.

You're talking Meat Loaf and the woman who sang Paradise by the Dasboard Light with him, or the Evanesecne thing, or Jefferson Airplaine, or the Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow duet (not all metal I know, but rock).

You're over-thinking it. Male and female metal singers. Ozzy and Lita.

That's good enough.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-23 03:03:39 Tarogato<br>Look up duets for a variety of instruments (voice included) and study them.

Sometimes you can just add "score" to your search term on youtube and end up with a lot of duets with the score included, and for the rest you can often find on IMSLP.

There are a lot of different ways to write with two monophonic instruments. You can have them play the same line in harmony (parallel thirds, parallel sixths, horn fifths), you can have one of them provide an accompanying line (like a bass line, alberti pattern, etc), you can have them echo off each other by playing similar things one after another (imitation). You can have them play in counterpoint (often understood to mean two completely different independent musical lines that share chord tones/ideas and thus work together, but can mean any way of harmonising a melody with similar note values)

[Lakme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M71FQzQBigE) (thirds harmony, some imitation)

[Mozart bassoon+cello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GMv0xCCPbM) (accompaniment, some harmony)

[Mozart two horns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDAnEe1n3k0) (a little bit of everything, mostly accompaniment)

[Beethoven two flutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOtD1Z_Sgo0) (thirds harmony, some counterpoint, accompaniment in the minuetto)

[Wieniawski two violins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCm5lJpPZJ4) (a lot of everything. Also, violins themselves are capable of playing more than one note simultaneously to a limited extent, and a lot of violin music is written around that capability, such as this piece)

[Beere two saxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD91oFhhosg) (modern piece with imitation, harmony, bit of everything)

[Gershwin Summer Time two clarinets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r5FfyV7zh4) (closer to a pop song than anything I've listed so far)

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-23 18:24:12 yeahmakessenseyeah<br>Genre has more to do with instrumentation, like the string quartet as opposed to the Pierrot ensemble. What you’re asking about has more to do with form. A fugue is a series of imitative entrances, with some other formal aspects, such as a melody and counter-melody. A nocturne is ideally a sort of “duet,” meaning that the right hand is performing a melody harmonized by thirds and sixths (usually), while the left-hand typically performs some sort of arpeggiation as accompaniment. Bach’s music, particularly his fugues, are highly polyphonic, meaning that there are several voices overlapping each other, resulting in a complex form in which the listener is at more liberty to sort of zoom in to follow one voice or out to hear the “whole picture.” A nocturne contrasts starkly with this form, in that it is typically much more lyrical, and thus the focus is directed primarily toward a single (though harmonized) melody.

I tried not to be too technical. I have failed in two ways: I was still too technical, and what I watered down will probably give others an excuse to lambast me. I am ashamed.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-03-28 21:38:08 SergeiSwagmaninoff<br>Thank you for your response! 

&gt;you can have two separate values in one single staff as well - as if two hands were playing on the same staff but it's only one hand.

This makes sense, since it is a cello-piano duet transcribed for the piano. So I suppose the quarter notes are carrying the famous cello melody whereas the other notes are carrying the piano accompaniment.

&gt;If you look carefully you'll notice that the melody quarter notes all have a stem that points up, while the 16th notes have stems that point down. This is how the two voices are delineated.

This is a helpful observation! Even though the notes that carry the melody are highlighted, this would be quite helpful in identifying the seperate melody line.

Thanks again!

I first heard this piece played by [these two violinists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaAtkDCPbeM), and I instantly fell in love with the sound of the violin and  their duet. The main theme is very memorable, simple and yet very beautiful.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-04-08 21:59:57 GlennMagusHarvey<br>The term "bassist" refers to playing a musical instrument by the name "bass", such as a double bass or bass guitar.

If you want to refer to someone who sings the bass part in an SATB choir, then the person is referred to as a "bass".

I'm not sure there's a specialized term in English for the person who plays the basso continuo part of a Baroque composition, but depending on the context, that could be "accompanist" (if it's just one person), or "continuo" (which could be one or more people, as the continuo part can indeed be and often was more than one performer).

Playing the lower part in a piano duet or playing the left hand of a piano part is not really a specialization anyone has so I don't think there exists a term for that.

But for undifferentiated cases, "bass player" would suffice.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2020-04-11 06:52:30 65TwinReverbRI<br>Orchestration is far more than knowing ranges.

You need years of experience listening to it and studying scores.

I'm going to make a suggestion - or give you some advice - feel free to take it or not, because it's going to sound negative, or condescending, or assumptive, or whatever, but this is based on years of experience and seeing 10-20 posts like this every day over on r/composer (which is really where you should have posted this).

You're not ready to compose for orchestra.

There, I said it. Sorry if it sounds bad.

But here's the thing - you, like so money, want to walk before you can run. 

Have you written for Piano and Violin? What about Piano and Flute? What about a trio for Flute, Cello, and Piano?

What about a duet for 2 violins? or a Trio for Flute, Oboe, and Clarinet?

Or anything like that?

You don't go from piano to orchestra.

You need to work your way up. And ideally, you need to write pieces you can actually have real musicians play.

If not you're not really "orchestrating". You're "synthestrating" using "synthorchestra" to compose what you think sounds OK in a DAW, but probably won't with real instruments.

In fact, it's really an absolute waste of your time to write for orchestra (other than if you just like it and don't care to actually learn anything from it). No orchestra is ever going to play your piece. They don't have time for that.

Instead you should focus on learning to write for each instrument one by one and in combinations where you can get real time feedback aurally from hearing it played by live players and verbally from players telling you what's good or not good about the parts you're writing.

So that's my advice. Sorry if it seems harsh but I'd rather you "get it" then blunder along writing synthorchestra stuff that you're not really learning anything from.

HTH
