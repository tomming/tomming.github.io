Some arrangements of Canon in D mercifully give the cellist a few measures of <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the middle somewhere, but the rest is the dreaded bass obligato. I usually just use the piece as a Zen meditation exercise. 

I actually hate Mozart string quartets even more because he dumps the bass line on the cello pretty much without exception, and it's nearly always a completely obvious and predictable bass part, even though he was certainly talented enough to do something more creative.

I think the actual argument here is that we're both correct. There is no one way of actually writing a song. People find different things more appealing or workable.

In Jazz, you'd certainly not want the bass as the leader/loudest like you would in an orchestra. Most often, it's either the lead player (usually trumpet) or the drummer that's the most important person.

In an Orchestral set, you'd want the bass to be louder (not dominating, but louder), and build the sound pyramid from the bottom to keep a good balance.

You can't really generalise pop. Pop can go under anything from a slow ballad to a Beyonce' song. Obviously, you'd want the vocals to be the main part of the song, but having every other element is also important. 

It's the fire-triangle - you need all 3 parts (fuel, oxygen and heat) to get it going. If you're missing one part, then you'll just have a spark and no flame.

Same applies for music. You need the melody, the bass, the harmony/<b><u>countermelody</u></b>, then the waffle/padding (the chords). While the waffle may seem unimportant, it is still a part of the music, and should not be overlooked. Without it, you just have a person singing a melody, and the music can become ambiguous or lose its tonal centre altogether.

If you're willing, post just one of your original songs and I'll comment.

If you look at The Beatles' "She's Leaving Home", John sings a rather simple <b><u>countermelody</u></b> on the chorus to complement Paul's "Sheeeeee's... Leeeeeeeaving... Hoooooooome", etc. There appears to be some form of reverb on John's <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, as well as at least two if not three tracks of it in unison -- "Never a thought for ourselves..." and so on.

Calm Americans by Elliott - Locked to the kick, carves this near subsonic <b><u>countermelody</u></b> without stepping on the piano or guitars.

Smile Lines by Incubus - Just too fucking tasty. It would be really easy to get lazy and just follow the guitar roots, but the harmonies and runs totally make the verse.

Myxomatosis by Radiohead - IMO, the greatest Radiohead riff since Planet Telex. Love the fuzz tone -- I think it's a Shin-ei FY-2, which can fetch silly amounts on eBay.

The Nerve by Mute Math - Another bass riff. Perfect starter for Armistice.

Both tracks, as you recorded them, could (imo) use some compression as I found the climax in each tune a bit overwhelming volume wise.  Your first track (Elegy) could maybe use a bit less background pads (loops?) at the start.  I found myself listening to your melody, <b><u>countermelody</u></b> and cool guitar harmonics but couldn't really pick them out easily in the mix.  The second tune was dead on and well played.  Again, some compression to get the volume leveled out (I swear you could do a whole post on compression and reverb and it would go on for days lol).  I thought the tones you got fit the song well.  I might would choose a different reverb and use less, but that is to taste.  An enjoyable listen!  As a producer from a different background, I would love to hear the OP comment on these tunes as well.  I am sure producers from different backgrounds would all have different opinions on how they might shape your arrangements.  Ultimately nobody knows how the song should sound better than you do.

Don't try and figure out what the arrangement is going to be in your head. Chances are, you'll succumb to left-brain thinking, which will suggest things you "should" add to the mix. For ex. what would be edgy, impressive, unique, etc. Fuck all that, seriously. What you want is gut reactions; you'll be listening at some point and then you'll find yourself singing a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or a note from a pad chord. Immediately begin tracking it, or make a note of it if you're away from your studio. Seriously though, listen as much as possible. Render your tracks in whatever state they exist in and put them on your iPod, and play them wherever you go. Let yourself be as indulgent with your music as possible at all times. The ideas will come.

The Dream - I could not tell you what was verse and what was chorus.  It was just a long...thing.  That's on the first listen, nothing concerning it just means it's probably not a hit single.  Not that it's not a really pretty song.  I'm talking add a tambourine or a harmony for contrast and you're good to go.  That's a production note more than a songwriting note...and this is a pretty bare recording so...yeah.  If I listened to that one 3 more times it's probably make perfect sense.  

Follow Your Heart - This one makes me want to hear it *finished*.  I'm totally interested in hearing this song more and I would looove to hear this realized with a band or something.  This version is just a demo to me.  Killer tune, really.  That's well done.

Fragile - Another production note.  The piano and guitar are sitting in the same spot sonically and they are competing.  There's lots of overlap and it's a disservice to both instruments.  I'd pop a repeating hooky piano part an octave up, or a slow pretty riff or <b><u>countermelody</u></b> higher up on the guitar to create a more comprehensive soundscape.  Look at your hands.  Place one on top of the other.  That's what's happening.  Now place them on a table next to each other.  Bigger area.  That's how much bigger the sound will be if those parts get spread out to cover a wider range of frequencies (I think that's the word).  I'm at 1:31 and I'm not sure if I've hear the chorus yet.  I need contrast!  That's especially important in acoustic music, not less important.  Ok, I am at 2:31 and the feel just changed for the first time.  The bridge.  I'm going to say this is a pretty good song too but it's not living up to its potential.  That's not a criticism man, that's a compliment.  

Ridin With MJ - Love love love this song.  The verses are good enough to be a chorus.  And I'm really digging the A and B parts because the chorus does up the ante.  Yeah, this is a pop gem.  I could see myself listening to this song on purpose, lots of times.

Kid's got a nice voice too.  I'd *really* like to hear these fleshed out.  That's a taste thing, if the acoustic version is a totally final product I get it but I want some meat on those bones.

This is really presumptuous and dicky, but do you think he would be willing to send me the tracks to Mary Jane, let me "bandify" it and send it back to him?

Once I have something I like I'll make a few more 3xOsc's and write stuff like a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or pads or whatnot, once I have a few things I like, I do that bass properly, once I have it sounding kinda cool I do the drums and get them to sit nicely and tighten up the mix a bit.

Once thats done its usually cymbals and snares. I always leave percussion for much later for some reason.

Once thats all done I usually do the arrangement of the song and then I work on the sounds.


I also always use the exact same flow when I work on a song, certain things are always routed to the same channels on the mixer, and I always name my groups the same things.  

I find it helps to be repetitive for certain things.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2010-08-03 03:40:22 illuminatedwax<br>&gt; As I said in another post, my music is very "riff oriented"

Think of it this way: your bass notes are going to put your riffs into context. So, let's say your riff has the notes A B C B A. If the bass is playing an A, it's going to make that riff sound like it's in A minor. If the bass line is playing a C, it's going to sound like it's in C major. If the bass is playing a G, it's going to sound like it's in G major. With those 3 notes, a bunch of different possibilities are possible. Try it yourself: record yourself playing those notes in whatever rhythm you want, loop it, and then play your bass along with it, droning on a single note to get an idea of what kind of feel it creates.


Once you have an idea of that, you don't have to have all your bass lines be boring pedal notes all the time. Modern pop uses bass as a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> very, very often (thank you, James Jamerson). So, once you have the basic idea of what kind of bass note to play along with the chords, you can write a bass line in that key. For example, in our example riff, if you liked the feel of the "A" note, you'd write a bass line in the key of A minor, since that's the key those notes dictate. (why? all the notes are in the scale of A minor, but not A major.) If you liked the feel the "G" had, you'd write in G major (for the same reason).
</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2010-08-05 12:26:21 addisonborn<br>Based on that you like prog-rock, I'd recommend you take a listen to Between The Buried And Me, namely *Colors* to start with.  Mixes metal, funk, jazz, and even has a ho-down section.  

Then, check out The Acacia Strain (*Continent* is a good starting point).  A little more doom-y, chugging, but still listenable to the uninitiated.  

After that, I'd suggest branching out to some more sub-genres.  Very different bands to check out are After the Burial, Genghis Tron, Integrity, Converge, The Number Twelve Looks Like You, Whitechapel, and The Fall of Troy.  

If it's the vocals you're having trouble listening to, you don't necessarily need to think of them as vocals.  They're just another percussive instrument adding texture and <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.

Above all, make it to a couple shows.  Best way to get introduced to the genre.

Negascout got a lot of the things I was going to say, but one thing I might like to point out is that the different sections could be linked together better.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2011-03-02 21:44:28 PHNS<br>* Melody refers to the main melody of the song. The harmony is what accompany the main melody. Harmony in general just refers to many notes at once, like in a chord. One of the notes in the chord is the root, the most important that defines what kind of chord it is. For example the note G in a "g minor chord". The rest are just harmonies to that note. The bass is sort of a harmony, but has a somewhat different purpose I guess. To not confuse you further, let's from here on call the "harmony" I spoke of in the earlier posts as "counter melody". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-melody 

* Harmonic minor scale has nothing to do with harmony. Just think of it as a name for the scale. You should not use different scales for the different parts, since that will cause too much of a dissonance. But try it and see for yourself. If it is an effect you want it may just work. It is not to uncommon to mix the minor and major scale at the same time to create ambiguity. But in short, use the same scale. However, you can change scale whenever you want, as long as it suits the song.

Listen/watch this fugue to further get the concept. It starts with an exposition of the melody and then plays along for a while. At 20 sec the melody starts over in another octave and the voice that previously played the melody now play a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. 40 seconds in the melody starts in another voice etc. You should clearly see when the melody starts over if you don't hear it.

It can be a little unwieldy at first, and most peoples' first times wind up with everything getting all bloody (and their first songs too.) Now, with that said, I'm gonna make some comments aimed at helping you improve -- don't get discouraged!

As acepincter said, I think the main instrument is a little too loud. Also, as nice as that melody is, it can get a little bit old after 2 minutes of repetition. Maybe if the instrument was a little quieter, or various of the melody were introduced, it'd be better. Or, you could change the instrument up every now and then, have the melody bounce around the song and encapsulate it while you show off those awesome drums. The other synths incorporate well into the piece, except it gets a little cluttered around 2:05 when you have everything going off at once.

I'm gonna go off on a little limb and say that you should maybe practice making songs by starting with a melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and play around with weaving the two together. If you want to make game music, this is a great way to get a feel for creating that memorable melody that leaves people humming it after the song is over. Also, practice altering that melody throughout the song. It can be as simple as having one note go a few steps higher or lower than it did before, or just change up the rhythm. This kind of thing will make your melody lines pop, which is what game music is all about.

Finally, the ending. It does need some work, I'm afraid, it kind of just stops. Usually I dislike fade outs, but it would work pretty well for this song considering it's meant to be heard on loop anyway. Or you could just have a surprise ending where it just stops mid-melody and leaves the listener hanging. But your song can't just peter out like that, give it some oomph!

Please don't take offense to anything I've said here. I work in FL on a daily basis and I want to help budding users improve. Happy composing, friend, and thanks for the listen!

Try to write down on a piece of paper where you want the music to climax, how long your build up is and where you want the music to settle down. The problem is that you have almost no tension, no build up. Also try to introduce a bit of counterpoint or at least <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in it, which will enrich your work.

Mixing seems good. I like how subtle the vibes are, and the organ as well.

In terms of composition, it's good background music but not very active. Maybe that's what you're going for, and if so you nailed it. But if you wanted to make it more present, I dunno, more energetic I guess, I would recommend adding some kind of melody instrument. I can see some kind of bluesy saxophone solo on top sounding beautiful, with the cellos that are already there providing a sort of <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. Or if not saxophone, I can even see a jazzy synthesizer being really moody and cool. Another thing I could hear (maybe instead, maybe as well) would be some kind of quick, high-register piano arpeggio-based melody, if that makes any sense? By quick I mean like, maybe 8th note triplets.

Those are just some of the thoughts that ran through my head as I was listening to this. I dont mean to criticize at all. If laid back, moody and atmospheric/ambient was what you were going for, then you nailed it. But if you want something that grabs attention more readily, and is meant to be actively listened to, I would suggest adding some sort of melody instrument.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2011-12-19 13:04:31 pemungkah<br>A few things. First, I'm hoping to give you dispassionate advice that will help make it better without telling you what to do, so there'll be more wrong than right mentioned. (These are exactly the same weaknesses I've had in my tracks, so I know them well.)

It suffers from "one-at-a-time" syndrome: one voice, then two, then three...which has been done a lot since Bach, and is hard to do well. If you have a theme (which I didn't detect, see below), entering with it and its <b><u>countermelody</u></b> may feel less predictable.

Your timbres are very similar, so the lines blur very quickly. The triplet-feel lines at around 1:00 are dissimilar enough from everything else that they sound "out of time" even they aren't. Different inherent note qualities can come from length as well as timbre (listen to any of Wendy Carlos's switched-on tracks: you'll hear sustained notes as well as very short staccato ones).

At the beginning, many of the contrapuntal lines are pitched relatively low with a fair bit of reverb, leading to them sounding muddy. You might want to transpose some of them up an octave (or two).

It's well performed, but doesn't have a through-line from start to finish: it sort of builds up to a certain point, hovers around there, and then stops without there having been a reprise of the original theme or anything else to signal "we are done". A modulation to another key and a return to the original is another way to do this; a distinctive timbre that "calls out" the theme and counter-theme will work too.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2011-12-31 14:48:20 xiipaoc<br>Chords are the distilled essential bits of harmony, not harmony itself.  C major is really more of a feeling than a chord.  If you can *feel* that the root of whatever's going on is C and you can *feel* that it's major-sounding and you can *feel* that there aren't complicating things like other important notes in the harmony, then it's C major.  You don't need the vertical structure to be there.

How does that "feeling" come about?  One way is that the notes of the chord are there and are somehow made important.  If you have C D E F G, G, A A A A G, F F F F E, E, D D D D C, then you don't really need any other notes to know that the first measure is C major, the second is F major then C major, the next is *either* F major or G7 followed by C major, and the last is G major followed by C major.  Just a couple of other notes -- say, a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that hits some of the auxiliary notes -- will make you certain that the last chord isn't suddenly an Abaug6, say, or it might clarify that the third measure is actually Dm, G9, C, Am7, and the last is Dm7/F, G9, C6.  (I think I embellished that a bit, at the end.)  By the way, the melody is Over the Hills and Far Away, which I know from Percy Grainger's Children's March.

What happens is that the mind remembers notes that came previously, especially if they were important.  For example, say you have eighth notes going G F E D C.  That's very much a C major harmony if you have no other clues.  Now, say a low A was being held before this.  Now you're thinking in the context of A minor instead of C major.  If a C major chord was playing before, you're going to hear three C major chords: *G* F *E* D *C*.  If a G7 chord was playing before, you're going to hear two G7 chords resolving to C major: *G* *F* E *D* *C*.  In the first case, the F and D were just passing tones; now, the E is a passing tone.  Same notes!

A good composer can use just hints to tell you what the harmony is, without having to stick a chord in front of you with neon signs and arrows.  A really good composer might leave the harmony ambiguous, leaving you not quite resolved until the composer wants the finality and certainty.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-02-05 15:16:40 xiipaoc<br>I've been in two wind ensembles that performed Baroque pieces like this.

Basically, in a normal performance, you have the ensemble in front of you on the stage.  In an antiphonal situation, you have usually two ensembles on opposite sides of the stage or even of the hall, giving you a stereophonic effect.  Usually the composer intends for the piece to be performed like this, so the two ensembles will be clearly in group 1 or group 2, and the two groups will interact with each other.  There's a lot of early work for brass written in this style.

Sometimes you'll have just one group of antiphonal instruments, like antiphonal trumpets.  The ensemble is on the stage doing its thing, and all of a sudden the trumpet section is on the balcony behind you playing a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.  Sometimes you'll have an "off-stage" ensemble, usually to produce the effect of the sound being distant or otherworldly.  I'm not sure if this counts as antiphonal, since usually they're not specifically in counterpoint to the main ensemble, just softer and hidden.

My last wind ensemble's director was a huge fan of doing fugues in antiphonal settings.  He'd have the basses on the right of the stage (house right) and the sopranos on the left, and the altos would be on the aisle by the stairs on the right and the tenors on the left.  It was REALLY hard to stay together separated like that; I'd imagine it was a total mess for the listener anywhere but the middle.  Probably why antiphonal performances have kind of fallen out of style these last 300 years!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-02-28 08:31:45 xiipaoc<br>Nice!

One of my favorite reharmonization techniques is the mode change, where you switch to the relative minor, or some crazier mode changes.  If you don't mind changing the melody notes, putting a minor melody into phrygian can be pretty awesome.

But my other favorite reharmonization technique, which is probably due to a little too much Grainger, is chromatic motion.  Not of the root, necessarily, but of some note in the chord.  If you imagine a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that's descending chromatically in some rhythm, the puzzle is to figure out chords that fit both those and the melody notes, and the melody notes are a bit less important, I think -- you can harmonize the entire melody with an Am7, for instance, but you really wouldn't want to!

Anyway, my only critique of your wonderful work is that you really don't need to add notes to chords to make them different.  Adding notes to chords is great only for two reasons: either the note you add is important, or you want to change the color of the chord.  For example, on the downbeat of the first measure, Am7 isn't more interesting than Am, since the G isn't important, but perhaps you want the jazzy feel.  Still, not much of a reharmonization over Am.  Ab7, on the other hand, would be a *very* different chord!

Good luck reharmonizing other things!  I know I can get carried away reharmonizing when I write songs for my a cappella group, and they get mad at me for making things too complicated. ;p
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-03-12 01:58:48 keakealani<br>Well, I can't say I know a lot about pop music but I can try to illuminate the process from a classical perspective...

One way to extend chord progressions is to cycle to different chords of the same function. For example, instead of I IV V I, you could do I IV ii V/V V I. You're basically extending the predominant function. This can be really effective if all the movement you do is chromatic, so you get this nice chromatic <b><u>countermelody</u></b> without really disrupting the harmonic structure of the piece.

Another strategy is to employ "passing" chords - the simplest explanation is something like I V6/4 I6. Essentially the bass line moves and the in-between chord is basically just decoration. You can often through chords in between any standard progression and still have a similar harmonic feel, but it does extend the progression significantly. Just experiment with chords you like.

I think part of longer progressions, especially in pop, is that you have to become a lot more adventurous. It only sounds interesting because it's a deviation from the norm. So be creative and look for chords that aren't necessarily standard for a progression. You might come up with something really cool :)

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2012-03-31 14:50:34 DuckDuckShrimp<br>Well I believe that melody can be copywritten, but that it tends to get tied in with the arrangement that goes behind it. (Ice Ice Baby being a perfect example of infringement even though they "changed a note") How much of this melody can you steal? Is it going to become your melody? A <b><u>countermelody</u></b>? Are you changing the note duration (half timing/double speeding or change rhythm all together)? 

Obviously, you can take the same melody and write something so completely and uniformly different with it arrangement wise that it doesn't sound like it was a lifted melody at all, and that would be the goal. It's a grey legal area, but I'd just keep these things in mind.

However, what it sounds like you're doing is in fact a remix or a rearrangement of something popular. I would suggest perhaps trying to tweak the melody in a significant way so it becomes your own. I'm all for using other work as a jumping off point (I frequently do this with lyrics) but I don't really dig the idea of using someone else's melody and calling it my own piece of music.

Fun fact, you can not copyright chord progressions, as they aren't seen as integral to the identity of a song as the melody/arrangement.

Here is banana phone: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5C6X9vOEkU

:10 - introduction
:11-:20 opening gist of the piece.  At this point there is a V/V or something similar.  Rather than going into a cadence it continues to an extension of the opening phrase.

:31 repeat of the opening theme.  Notice the added use of clarinet this time? It introduces a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> while at the same time prearing another important 'voice' into the piece.

:53 3rd repeat.  The point of this is that the clarinet becomes a more noticeable part of the piece.  Also is the first time with a cadential cadence.

Basically these pieces are actually quite carefully constructed.  It's just that most people dismiss them as "kids music" instead of something creative and quite artistic.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2012-05-15 11:56:32 thejacknut<br>I use a 4-track app on my phone and normally hum whatever little pieces I write in my head onto a track. That way, later, if I come up with a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, I can just hum it onto a new track, and thereby keep the composition intact. 
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2012-05-31 05:51:31 you_wouldnt_know_him<br>Your job (generally) is to simultaneously provide a groove that fits in with the drums and a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that compliments the lead part. To that effect:

* Do not just play root notes
* Even where you're playing inversions of the chords to spice it up a bit, don't just play the one note. <b><u>Countermelody</u></b>, not just a mindless dum dum dum.
* Do not just play a simplified version of the lead part
* Do not play without understanding the theory behind the music, no matter the genre.
* Do practice scales and arpeggios (chords where the notes are played individually)
* Practice all the scales, not just the major and pentatonic. The modes of the major scale are the important ones to focus on. (sorry if you already know this but plenty of guitar players get along without this whereas dedicated bass players HAVE to know it to sound good)
* Experiment on your own, then to a drum beat and then with a melody as well. All three stages are important.
* Make the rhythm interesting. This will vary by genre. If you're more into your alt-rocky sound then I recomend listening to Robert Sledge from Ben Folds Five to get a feel for how a simple bass part can be interesting if you change the rhythm up a bit. Similarly Cliff Burton for metal and the list is too long for Funk and Jazz but I'm sure someone else can help you there.
* LISTEN to everything that's happening around you. You want to hit a happy medium where you sound interesting but still fit in with others.
* Don't resent the fact that you're playing the 'least cool' instrument. There's an A Song Of Ice And Fire quote about dwarfism and bastardy here but I can't remember it.
* NEVER neglect the tone. The contrasts you can get out of different pickup and EQ settings can bring the music to life. Neglecting it will make the bass part sound crap.
* Don't use distortion or filtery sounds unless you're thinking about it. Once again Robert Sledge is a great example: he knows when to distort the fuck out of his sound and when to dial it back.
* Any time you need inspiration look up a bass solo by Geddy Lee, Flea, Les Claypool or Victor Wooten.

Definitely stick with either sharps or flats. While it may seem reasonable to pick and choose based on where they're going, you also have to consider the performer. Seeing F# Bb G# Db would be somewhat confusing. Besides that, theory is about more than just voice leading and revolves more around harmonic structure than anything, and combining accidentals goes against that fundamental aspect because it doesn't clearly outline anything. Typically if I see a flat mixed in with a bunch of sharps, I would think #5b9 type chords or something along those lines where you have no choice but using mixed accidentals.

The thing about Bach's voice leading is that it was dependent on melody/<b><u>countermelody</u></b>. If he swapped voices it was because he didn't want to break a recurring line to conform to a rule. I think the easiest solution for the voicing issues in your pieces is simply moving the bass down an octave. More space is generally better for small ensembles anyway for clarity. 

Anyway, these are just my thoughts. Take them with a grain of salt. I like the pieces!

As a matter of opinion, I would have the violin play melody or harmony rather than a sort of <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. Perhaps have the clarinet and violin switch parts?
Overall, pretty good for a young band.
</p></li><li><p><b>Jazz</b> 2012-06-28 23:44:10 8_Bit_Apple<br>Not <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, sorry, I must have zoned out when I wore that. I meant have the sax and violin both play the melody, since they're both so different and distinct, and have the clarinet play the backgrounds (what the violin is currently playing)

And tighter as in they don't always fit together smoothly. Having the rhythm section practice getting in the groove of this song should help that.

Yeah - I tried to fill out those bits but I couldn't really get anything to work better than it does when left more sparse. A <b><u>countermelody</u></b> would be too distracting and I felt arpeggios would be too much after the previous few bars. A different bass line, perhaps..?
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2012-07-15 01:26:33 Davidarius<br>I've always been really into that strange sort of chip music (is that what you would call it?) you get in those old school Razor crack patches, so this was a nice little nostalgic song for me!

Not sure what software you're using to do all of this, but I find when you're doing something with a digital format, anything with a grid of any sort can be a huge help, particularly with keeping track of beats and making sure they're totally locked in (The interface on Cubase has always been particularly helpful for me). 

-That old adage, "less bore-us, more chorus" would certainly apply here. I get that you were trying to piece layers on to build up the intro, but give the listener a little taste of the melody line starting at about 0:09. Nothing too much, but just a little bit to keep the listener on edge.

-A minor slip up on the drum track at 0:26-0:27, sounds just a little out of time, as if the loop was out of whack a bit? Also, when you're hitting those crashes in the intro, put a kick behind them. Doesn't seem like it'd do much but it really helps carry the momentum of the track.

-Really enjoyed the slight phase (?) on the main synth line starting at 0:48, panned itself beautifully across my headphones, helped to keep it nice and unintrusive. The little crescendo it does at 1:13 is a bit full on, maybe drop the volume a tad there? I see where you were going with it though! The sound of the synth line is so distinct in itself it doesn't really need to be brought that much forward in the mix.

-Again, like the intro, at 1:16, introduce an ascending synth line - just one more melodic layer there would really carry the interlude.

-That key change at 1:44 was very cool. Nice little change in tone. The main melody line hits a few bung notes at 1:56-57, not sure what effect you're using to give it more presence, but tone it down a little. Let each layer have it's own distinct flavour, once you've got that, fiddling with volumes shouldn't be too much of a hassle.

-A bit of a spike in volume for the main synth line at 2:30-31. Easily fixed though!

-Another issue of bung notes at 3:00-01/3:03-04/3:17. What I find helps with melody lines (granted you have a keyboard on hand) is to play the chord with one hand and then actively add notes to it with the other. If any of them sound 'off', then they're not appropriate for that chord - a sort of laymans way of finding what notes are in key!

-In the final segment of the song, I'd put it at about 3:21 onwards, don't be afraid to throw in another <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. It's the end of the song, make it interesting and memorable!

Given that you're new to making music, this is a solid effort and a pretty damn good product so far. Keep up the good work, brother!


</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2012-08-06 03:16:07 xiipaoc<br>Play around on the keyboard or something.  Maybe something will come to you.  Maybe not.  If something does, great!  If nothing does, oh well.  Keep going about your business until inspiration strikes.

Before I started composing, I'd been playing the fugue in C#m from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier Book I, and as I'm not a great pianist, I couldn't play it very well.  (I've gotten better since, I hope!)  I'd been in band since middle school, and I couldn't help but imagine how amazing that fugue would sound played by a wind ensemble.  So one day, the week before I went off to college my sophomore year, I got a copy of Sibelius and arranged it.  Took me a while to get used to the interface, and the balance was kind of off, and there was a lot wanting about my transcription, but I was happy with it.  And hey, I wrote something!  Isn't that nice?

I'd actually been composing since before this; I just hadn't done it on the computer, so it never went very far.  One of the things I was trying to write was a march based on Jewish liturgical tunes.  One of them always felt like a march, and the other was slow and beautiful, so it was appropriate for a trio by playing it in half-time at double tempo -- that is, play it in 2/2 at half note = 72 and play the rest of the piece in 4/4 at quarter = 144.  I thought it was a cool idea, but it wasn't one I came up with while sitting in front of a blank score.  So when I finished that Bach transcription, I started work on this.  It was a *lot* harder, since I had to come up with my own parts for everything.  With a transcription, every note was predetermined; I only had to choose who would play it and how.  With my own arrangement, the melodies were somewhat set, but I had to come up with harmonies -- easy, easy, because they were based on the melodies -- and *parts*.  Moreover, I had a first strain and a trio, but no second strain, no break strain, no trio intro, no coda.  The nice thing about my march was that it was based on tunes I knew from synagogue (which proved to be quite a hit when I had it performed), so since I didn't go very often and really hadn't gone in years at the time, I didn't have a huge selection available.  It wasn't too hard to just go through what had stuck with me and pick out what worked the best.

My general point, I guess, is that it's a *lot* easier to write off of a preexisting source material than to come up with your own.  That blank score is the hardest thing to get over.  I spend weeks before writing something just brainstorming it and trying to organize it.  When I know I want to compose a particular thing, I spend those weeks thinking about what I should write, what form it should take, etc.  When I do finally start writing, voilà, I now have a "preexisting source" for the rest of my composition!  I'm sure it's better to do all that development before I start actually writing anything, for a more balanced approach, but that's just not how *I* do it.  And I'll often spend weeks stuck at a particular point because I'm not sure how to go on, and just work on other things until I get some inspiration.  When I start, after the first few bars, the piece largely composes itself.  There are exceptions, of course.  I'm currently writing a symphony (I haven't actually written anything in it in, like, two years, but I've been busy).  It started as a little experiment; I wanted to write a light piece in 5/4, but after the fifth bar, which was in 7/4, I realized I wanted to take it in a different direction, a more serious one.  About a minute (of music) later, it was clear that this could be a symphony.  Well, that was great!  There was a great jumble of stuff happening in those first four measures in 5/4, which I kinda wrote by accident, and I could pull some of it for use later.  That fifth bar in 7/4 had some more stuff, and its <b><u>countermelody</u></b> became one of my primary themes.  My piece has some interesting non-functional harmonies, too; at one point, I used a four-note phrase -- I don't remember the actual notes, but transposed, it's A C Ab E, with the notes having different lengths, rhythmically.  In the second movement, I did everything I could with those notes, reharmonizing them, etc.  I decided I wanted to use a minor-major seventh chord (for example, D F A C#) as a motif, and by luck, those notes can transform into that chord: D F C# A is a transposition of A C Ab E, with enharmonic equivalents.  As this process has been taking *years*, there are a lot of interesting moments that I was inspired to write, and I used material from those moments both to figure out how to get there and in general as more source material.

TL;DR: once you get the ball rolling, it's much, much easier to find your way.  Keep trying!

As much as it is bach I think you should give it a little more 'flair' rather than just another reading of Lute suite II prelude.

With it being (evidently) baroque, you should try to express what you see as the beauty of each <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or embellishment. You do do this subtly, but I think you're putting too much thought on the notes rather than the different articulations, which is an essential part of playing baroque (and the guitar!) - maybe exaggerate the conclusion to the prelude, bring out the antiphonal phrasing (which this prelude is plastered in) with alternating pont/normal timbre

You've got me listening to all that suite now, enjoyed it man 
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2012-08-16 23:35:05 ZoeBlade<br>My process is usually something like this these days: pick an arbitrary key; pick a nice chord progression and/or main melody; make a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the same chord progression; keep layering up more instruments; add another section with different chords (maybe even segueing into a different key); copy and paste these, then chisel away at them to work out the arrangement with the slow buildups and the drops/breakdowns, occasional false endings, etc.

By the time I'm at around that stage, I've entered flow and can stop thinking about such things, excitedly hurrying back and forth between swapping out instruments for better ones, improving or replacing weaker melodies, adding yet more layers, and so on.

I always leave production (EQing, levelling, effects) to last, with the exception of heavy effects that are integral to the sound and emotions I'm conveying, or alter the sound of the melody, being like repeated notes in their own right.  I pick the climax to the song where all the instruments are playing at once, mute everything, and EQ one instrument at a time, then level them all, then pan them all, then automate panning and filter noodling... and probably change more parts of the track yet again.

Sometimes I do various parts of this process multiple times, occasionally with A/B testing with randomised filenames and asking my partner which version's best.  For some aliases, I'm very methodical.  For others, it's much more quick and instinctive.

Generally if you're sightreading out of the real book, the horn players will be playing melody/<b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and you'll be comping. There's already a lot of material written on comping, and I'm not going to try to explain that here, but in a nutshell, comping gives substance to the chords and rhythms inherent in the melody. Adding lines here and there in the style of Basie or Ellington is nice, but you don't want to get in the way of the melody - the music won't mesh well. Such lines are generally improvised (the best way to learn this is by listening and transcribing).

If you're still intent on playing written-out countermelodies and basslines, the DIY approach is best. Analyze the chords as given in the real book, and figure out which scales work with the harmony, then create lines which use those scales. There's no formula for writing music - just listen to a lot of music and copy what you like.

</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2012-09-11 05:34:54 ratiugssab<br>My approach is comes from my idea of what makes a good walking line:

* A good, solid crotchet and a deep, swinging feel
* Describes the harmony accurately, clearly and efficiently
* Makes the soloist/rest of the ensemble sound good (follow them rhythmically and harmonically; respond to and expand on melodic ideas; but mostly PLAY THE CHANGES AND PLAY GOOD TIME)
* Creates and releases tension
* Is an interesting and viable <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in its own right

Three ways to develop strong time and a sexy motherfucking feel: work with a metronome, play with musicians who have strong time and a sexy motherfucking feel, and play along with recorded bass lines that have strong time and a sexy motherfucking feel. That last one is really important. It's part of the transcription process which I'm going to talk about in a bit. Seriously though, sort your time and your feel out now - they are **SO** much more important than the notes you play, man...

...but you are going to need to play some notes, so let's start with the fundamental building blocks of any walking line: chord tones. Your line needs to clearly describe the harmony of the tune you are playing, and the most direct way of doing that is to play the notes that make up the harmony: the chord tones. So practice playing lines with only chord tones. Experiment with different combinations and discover what sounds good. Create some shapes. Start out by putting the root on the first beat of each bar. Prioritise the root and the 5th because they're strong and will always sound good. Shit, you could probably stop reading here and get some gigs. But keep going.

So you've got the chord tones nailed and falling nicely under your fingers... but your line is lacking something. It probably feels a bit flat and like it's not really going anywhere. You need to create some tension - some forward motion. Look, there are a shit ton of ways to make that happen through a combination of rhythmic, harmonic and melodic devices, and there's no way I'm even going to begin to try to cover all of them, but I will suggest that you explore the use of chromatic approach notes (before playing the root of a chord on beat 1 of the bar, try play a note a semitone above or below), diatonic approach notes (same as before except the note should be one tone away within the same key or [scale system dictated by the chord](http://www.outsideshore.com/primer/primer/ms-primer-4.html)), and dominant approach notes (approach the root with a note that resolves down a fifth).

Okay, so weeks of hard practice later, you're hearing and playing some sweet ass lines that are swinging like a middle aged couple trying to spice up their sex life and with more resolution than an HD TV. You're happy you've got the fundamentals down and you feel about ready to start playing with other jazz musicians. DO IT! Get to some jams and show off what you've learned. You're probably going to notice the other bass players playing all sorts of tasty shit you didn't even know was possible... "where'd they learn that!?" you're going to ask yourself.

I'll tell you! You see, while you were busy pissing about with chord tones and resolution, they were listening to the sweet, sweet, jazzy music and learning to play all the filthy, disgusting lines they found within.

"But wait! I thought you said all that chord tone stuff was important!" Oh, it is so damn important. You need to understand it, to have it under your fingers, and to always be able to improvise a harmonically descriptive bass line. You see, that forms the skeleton of your bass playing, but now we need to put some meat on those bones and flesh it out. Listen to jazz. Pick one or two recordings where you can't get enough of the bass playing ([here's a freebie... check out the bass line under the piano solo at 2:45](http://open.spotify.com/local/Oscar+Peterson+Trio/Night+Train/Bag%27s+Groove/340)) and listen to them non stop, until you can sing the bass line, or at least part of it, from memory, with and without the recording. Now try playing it bit by bit on your instrument... slowly at first, but then speed up. Got it under your fingers? Now play along with the recording and try to pick out the phrasing and articulation, as well as the feel and placement of the notes. Once you really have it down, start to isolate the bits you really like. They might only be a bar long, or they might be four bars, either way, discover what chord progression they describe and learn them in all twelve keys. Now, whenever you encounter that chord progression in any key, you have something interesting you can play on it.

From here you have all the tools to develop yourself as a walking bass player. Just remember to keep coming back to the music and never be afraid to try ideas out, especially not in the safety of the practice room.

I'm way too ~~tired~~ lazy to proofread this, so if anything doesn't make sense or you have any more questions, just let me know.

Edit: I feel like I should point out that I glossed over a lot here. Each of these individual points takes a lifetime of dedication to truly master. This is just a springboard, so do your own research and exploration!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-09-14 03:07:43 xiipaoc<br>That's nice!  Very pretty.  It's a good first section.

A minuet is usually in AABBCCDDAABB form, though it can vary.  The CCDD is a contrasting section called the trio (I think at one point it was played by a reduced orchestration or something).  The trio is usually in a different key -- usually the IV but that's not necessary -- and has a different mood.  In a good minuet, the B section is an answer to the A section, and the D section is an answer to the C section, but the main part and the trio aren't so closely related; if they are, it no longer sounds like it's the trio section.  A minuet is also always in a fairly moderate 3/4; if it's too fast it's more like a scherzo, which is otherwise the same as a minuet.

Of course, you should feel free to break the form.  You can vary quite a bit while still leaving enough elements in there that it's still recognizable as a minuet.  You can change the repeats, for instance: AABBA at the start, or AAB, or AABA, or just AB.  You can skip the repeats the last time through, which is very common.  You can follow common march practice and make the repetitions different from the originals in some meaningful way -- softer, staccato except for the <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, something like that.  You can play around with the form.  Remember that even non-minuets can be good music -- if you break the mold too much, it doesn't mean you've failed!

Once you can do that easily by ear (and with popular music, it's usually very predictable as well), you can try singing a third above or below the main singer, inside the chord.  Harmonizing requires a solid knowledge of the principal line, because you have to compose, on the fly, your own <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to it!  Try varying rhythms, adding fills, suspensions, stuff like that.  And practice!
</p></li><li><p><b>ratemyband</b> 2012-10-07 08:33:07 HarshAnonymousReview<br>Sounds pretty good.  Not really my style, but I liked the vocals, and the music supported them well.  The songs have a nice pace to them too.  I'll try to find your weak points now...

Risk Everything - 2:35 is nice, but gets repetitive quickly.  The extra guitar that comes in doesn't add enough to make it interesting.  Try some sort of melodic solo.  It doesn't have to be difficult, as long as it's artistic.

My Biggest Fear - Couldn't find a weak point.  Good job :)  OH WAIT - the very ending!!  I don't like it when songs do that, lol

Older - 1:02 this string part is awesome!  All the other strings parts are kinda "fillers", but this is nice.  3:00 and on, the solo guitar does some weird things that don't fit at all.  It sounds like the guitarist is soloing in the background, but you only hear a few random notes that distract from the rest of the music.  If you want a solo here, try long, sustained notes.  Throw some chorus and verb on them, and bring them up in the mix.  Think of them as a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to the vocal line.

Tomorrow - 1:02 the entrance of the tremelo guitar could be better.  All your other entrances and changes of pace are excellent, whereas this is kinda bland.  Either make it more subtle, or give it some more bite.  2:36 has much more potential.  I'm not sure what to do here... maybe lower the guitar an octave?  The whole part just doesn't have the intensity it could have.  If you can get string parts here, that would help, as long as they're only in a supporting role.

Lost Boy - the tremelo guitar is a little distracting in the rhythm when it's strummed.  The picked parts are fine.

For drums, I would listen to the band Atomship, especially their song Mothra.  They're much heavier rock than you guys, but their drummer is fantastic, and you might be able to tone down some of his techniques and use them for transitions and stuff.

Overall, it sounds really good.  If you guys want feedback on any future projects, just send me a message.  Good luck!!
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2012-10-11 16:33:18 Zagorath<br>I'm going to take Beethoven, since he's the composer I'm most familiar with. You're most often going to hear his symphonies and piano sonatas, so I'll focus on his style with them, but most of this could also be applied to his concertos, string quartets, and other pieces (such as trios) as well.

I've created a PDF document, as well as exported the audio from it as a .WAV file (if you want another format just ask, I can do MP3 or AIFF). The PDF is labelled with the extract numbers that I've referenced below. [**Here's a link to the public Dropbox folder**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/40f1y42ib3ja2oj/yiUj1wscXK/Beethoven) with the PDF, Audio, and the Sibelius file I got both the others from. (A note incase anyone comes across this further in the future, I probably won't have the Dropbox folder accessible forever, but if you come across it and want to see the files just PM me and I'll arrange something.)

The most obvious thing is Beethoven's use of tritones and diminished 7ths. Perhaps the most obvious example is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz7usUEPWsc), at the very beginning of the third movement of his "Appassionata" piano sonata (let me just take this moment to say Lisitsa is absolutely not my favourite pianist, I don't think her interpretations are much good at all, but her version is technically high quality, good audio and video, and was easy to find on YouTube). You can also take a look at extract **1** from the sample score, the notes Bb, Db, E, and G are used. These notes make up a diminished 7th chord (basically it's a series of minor third intervals), with a distinctive dissonant (clashing) sound. Other examples include the mainly very light sounding first movement of Sonata No.10, right before the end of the exposition, or 3:18 in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW-smu22ems). It's even more prominent in the [second movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7S63Imwa3U&amp;feature=relmfu), happening all over the place, but extract **2b** probably shows it better than anywhere else. Beethoven frequently uses these strong dissonances in very light and innocent ways, which is a key part of his style. Looking at his symphonic works, see bar 7 of the Symphony No.3 (the third bar of extract **4**), between the C# in the cello and G in the violin.

I think that the way Beethoven uses this dissonance is absolutely brilliant. Sure, you get *more* dissonance if you go later into the Romantic period or into the 20th century with composers like Shostakovich and Stravinsky (there's a recurring theme in The Rite of Spring which, if you transcribe it for piano, is almost just slamming your hand down on the keys rhythmically), but the exact way Beethoven uses very careful tritones and diminished sevenths in combination with the more consonant harmonies is second to none, in my opinion.

Although Beethoven has a lot of heavy, serious pieces, but there's also a lovely selection of much lighter pieces. The thing about Beethoven, though, is that he clearly had some sort of inner turmoil, and even these light pieces have heavier, darker, moments. Take the famous Für Elise, the "C" section (extract **3**), which is really sinister when compared to the lovely light famous melody of the main tune. The cheerful 5th movement of Symphony No.6 also has slightly darker moments, such as at 7:07 in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg67OkRj0Us), poorly transcribed  as extract **5**.

*I think that's the key thing about Beethoven's sound, no matter what happens there's always an underlying struggle going on.* Some form of anger or sadness always shows itself within Beethoven's works.

An interesting extra thing about his Piano Sonatas is that a lot of them sound very orchestral, like they are a transcription of something written for orchestra. Perhaps the chief of these is [the Pathétique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQebdkLvD00), with tremolo octaves (**6a**, or 1:48 in the video) in the first movement, and a sort of call and response between the bass and treble in the second thematic section of the Allegro (**6b**, or 2:17), and [the second movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H40j6s3NCRE&amp;feature=relmfu) having a very orchestral style middle harmony and sforzandos, with Andras Schiff describing the triplets like two clarinets (**6c**, or 2:43 in the video). Another good example in my opinion is the [opening to the Waldstein](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDvMcz6uWRc).

Beethoven's Symphonies also have a distinct timbral style (the way different instruments are used together) that's much harder to describe. He uses the wind instruments a lot for chords and harmonies, but not so much for the main melody. When he does use it for the melody it makes very clever use of the timbre of the instrument specifically. Listen to any of his symphonies played in a full orchestra and you'll get a sense of his very unique timbre, it's hard to describe. I'd say the best to listen to for this purpose would be the third movement of Symphony No.5, the second movement of No.7, and the first (or fourth) movement of No.3.

My absolute favourite thing, though, is the way Beethoven deals with counter-melodies and harmonies. The two best examples of this I think are the Moonlight Sonata, mvt.1, the left hand at a point near the end (extract **7**, or [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARNRFubbnyc) at 3:27), listen closely to the bass or if you can play it yourself, just the bass. It's just incredibly to listen to! And the recapitulation to the first movement of [Beethoven's 5th](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKnOYSWT5BM) (actually, throughout this piece there are brilliant moments for this, such as the cellos playing the duh duh duh duuuuh motif during the more lyrical melody the strings and wind play at 2:58, and many more), the bassoons and oboes have some amazing parts. Listen from 5:30, the bassoon's <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and then the oboe's long notes *after* its solo. This isn't the best version for hearing either of those, [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4IRMYuE1hI) at 4:06 is better (in fact, this version is probably better overall), or [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2qW6fOtAMY) from 4:19 (just the oboe after the solo, not the bassoon before it). Beethoven is absolutely amazing at doing this kind of subtle but beautiful harmony.

Anyway, that's my two and a bit cents on my favourite composer, if you're interested in learning more I would strongly recommend checking out [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuYY1gV8jhU) in which Leonard Bernstein talks about Beethoven's musical style, why he's so great but also what he believes were Beethoven's weaknesses. Then check out [this response to it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjct5M8JzL4) from a more recent professional composer/orchestrator.

EDIT: By the way, don't apologise for your long-windedness. That's part of what made the last thread interesting, and what I hope will make this thread equally awesome. I'm exactly the same way (as you can see from this overly long chunk of text). I've just rewatched the video responding to Bernstein and it reminded me of just how good it really is. You *have* to find the time to watch it, even if it is quite long. It's just a fantastic insight to the quality of Beethoven's music, even if you haven't seen Bernstein's criticism (although the response is even better if you have seen that).
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2012-10-18 12:41:52 Zagorath<br>OK, it looks like no one else has covered form, apart from /u/scrumptiouscakes' description of sonata form and fugue. When identifying form, it's really important to keep /u/indeedwatson's comment about learning to identify themes in mind.

I'll start with the most basic form **binary form**

You don't actually come across binary form very much except in some early baroque music and the Renaissance, but it's important to know about because in a way it's the building block for a lot of other forms. Binary, as you may know from computers, or just basic language skills, means two. In binary form there are two sections, usually called A and B. The second section will be distinct from the first, and usually modulates into a different key (I'll describe a bit about keys at the end). Pieces in a major key (like C major) will usually modulate to the dominant (or 5th, which if the tonic, or original key, was C major would mean a modulation to G major), and pieces in a minor key usually modulate to the relative major (the major with the same key signature. The relative major of C minor is Eb major for example).

Pieces in a binary form often take the form of AABB, where they play the first theme, then repeat it, and then move on to the second theme, before repeating it too.

The next simplest form is **ternary form**

As the name suggests, this form has three parts. It expands on the binary form by repeating the first theme at the end. The form is usually ABA, or AABBA. They take the first theme, then move on to a second contrasting theme, before going back to the first theme to end.

Most Minuets and Scherzos use ternary form. The A section is often known as the "minuet", while the B section is called a "trio". One example of this would be [Beethoven Symphony No. 3, third movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJDQMyHbSko) (indeed, most symphonies' third movements will be a minuet or a trio, although sometimes the second and third swap around). For a really clear example where the two themes are blindingly obvious, and the transitions clear, I'll point you to [my own Scherzo composition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAHrgI_twUw).

**Rondo form**, and its Baroque counterpart **Ritornello**

Another step up in complexity, Rondo form takes a single recurring theme, and adds to it various different episodes. In basic terms it usually takes the form ABACADA (and can continue throughout the alphabet as desired ABACADEAFAGAHA). Its relatively rare to find a perfect Rondo, as composers will often reuse the episodic content sometimes, so it's something more like ABACAB'ADA, (the B' indicates it's B, but slightly varied), and will change the main theme in various ways.

In Baroque music the Ritornello form was used, which is nearly the same thing, but the main theme is referred to as the "ritornello". A good example is [Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No.2, first movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgVNYrYZKcM), although it's very complicated in the ways it differs from a perfect ritornello.

(Another thing that's interesting to note about this piece, listen to 2:22 – 2:30, one of the ideas going on in the background (first the flute), and then listen to the [second movement of the same piece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=8z-l5sF8Vp8#t=295s), which uses the same idea.)

**Theme and variations**

Pretty basic in concept, it takes a single theme and then does a whole bunch of variations of that theme. Each time it changes the theme slightly. The classic example is [Mozart's 12 Variations on Twinkle Twinkle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO-ecxHEPqI) (the top comment is very true, and quite funny, I've seen it happen myself). Another really good one (in my opinion, a far better piece) is [Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL5aiUKPt3Q). A rhapsody is a piece with free-flow (i.e., no definitive form) but with a lot of different contrasting textures, moods, etc. This particular rhapsody happens to be a rough sort of theme and variations.

**Strophic** and **Medley/Chain**

Strophic is usually used with respect to modern pop music, where it refers to a typical verse chorus format where the notes are the same each time. If used in classical music, it's basically AAAA.

Medley is the opposite of this, ABCD, with no repetition. You often get medleys made from the music of a film. [Here's a really good medley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWnC6IbYpgs) of a variety of music from John Williams's different films, for 12 horns.

**Sonata form**

Aside from fugue, which dropped out of popularity after Bach's death, Sonata form is arguably the most complex musical form.

It begins with an *exposition* (sometimes there is a small introduction before this, though), in which the main themes are presented. The exposition usually consists of two groups of contrasting themes (in a way, the exposition could be considered binary form but that's not something that gets mentioned very often). The first set of ideas will be in the tonic (before going any further it's a really good idea to see below about keys), and the second (after a bridge which links the two) will usually be in either the dominant or the relative major (if the tonic is minor).

Once both sets of themes have been introduced, the music moves on to the *development* section where the themes are both used in a variety of different ways and in different keys.

After the development, we return to the main thematic idea in the *recapitulation*. The first theme will be in the tonic, but then the bridge will be altered so that the second theme can be in the tonic as well (or the parallel major if the second theme was in the relative major in the exposition). In the recapitulation the two themes might be slightly altered, sort of like they've learnt something during the development, or been affected by it irreversibly.

You then often get a coda to wrap it up.

Mozart's 40th is a great example of sonata form, as is his 41st "Jupiter". That said, I'm going to quickly walk you through the sections of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C minor, per [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRgXUFnfKIY).

0:08 begins the exposition . This is the first theme, in the tonic key of C minor.

0:50 the horns enter with the second theme, in the relative major key of Eb major. (Notice at 0:55, 0:57, and at other points the basses and cellos, in brown and dark orange, play something very similar to the first theme.)

At 1:32 it repeats the entire exposition from the beginning.

2:58 begins the development.

The recapitulation begins with the main theme at around 4:18 or so, but listen to the bassoon <b><u>countermelody</u></b> (it can be difficult to hear on many recordings, but I've got a [piano version of that bit here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2559026/Beethoven/Beethoven%20Extracts.wav), just skip to 2:15 in the wav file. The bassoon plays the low <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. You can also see it as dark green in the video), and of course the oboe solo at 4:36.

5:11 is the start of the second theme, this time instead of Eb major it's in C major. Note that it's green on the score (which represents bassoons), but you hear the horns play. This is because when Beethoven wrote this piece, horns couldn't play all the notes, only select notes from the harmonic series (trumpets had the same problem). Because of this, the horns in Eb used in this piece couldn't play this idea in the recapitulation because its key is different to the exposition. Beethoven instead wrote it for the bassoons. There is debate over whether Beethoven would have wanted the horns to play it if they could, or whether he likes the weaker sound of the bassoon here because it represents some idea of the heroic theme (the second theme from the exposition) being weakened and eventually overpowered by the darker theme (the first theme from the exposition). Different recordings make different choices about whether to put that bit on the horns or bassoons.

5:53 is the beginning of the massive coda. Beethoven often used really large codas in comparison to the overall work.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2012-10-22 12:01:09 Ihearcolor<br>Done. Typical DnB intro. Kinda like how you drop out the hat for a bit. Your kick could be a little fatter. Highhat sample is questionable but passable. Had to pause to take a piss. Ok back in it. Like the melodic stabs, yet are a bit overused for this type of music in my opinion. They're maybe a bit loud in the mix or have to much verb...maybe cut the highs a bit? Feel like there needs to be another midrange element to balance out the track. Its too thin at 2:00 min in. Fill it out with bass or mids and another <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that is subtle. Like the drop and the chill pad is nice. Sounds like Massive? I may use the same one, ha. The suckout is a little off. Your style reminds me of Deadmau5. It's pretty minimalistic and it works, but think you can make it sicker by adding the aforementioned embellishments. Digging the bassline, but needs to cut through more, maybe Equed. Or a real bass, or an octave lower. Track would sound good with vocals. Even if was just for a few sections. Nice ending pad again. Like the subtle change to make it minor. Not sure how I feel about the ending. 

Overall. You have some real potential. You get the gist of how to make a song, but should work on the small and subtle things that put the icing on the cake. Would love to check up on you in a few years to see how you've progressed.

Compare Marty's [Never Forget](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyDZscyf8lU), [Deference for Darkness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a70h0cX8AMM) and of course the eternal [Halo Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0mQk7JEVq4) to the generic, boring action-movie works of Davidge - such as [Ascendancy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YfFfFUKqZY) and [Faithless](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npMi1Il2n7w). They also sound identical to each other - there are no memorable themes, let alone something like the gregorian chant or the cello bass line from Halo CE, or the saxophone from ODST. It's just a generic crappy action movie constantly repeated strings theme over a generic and constantly repeated bass line, with a bit of percussion thrown in to make it feel exciting. Take [Haven](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26z6ZFpJggc), for example - it's the same lower strings melody repeated again and again with some basic chords beneath it for TWO WHOLE MINUTES, led off by that god-awful augmented fourth (which sounds mysterious and haunting *in moderation*) and then another pattern repeated for the next two minutes, the only difference being a crescendo to make it seem like something important happening, and a slight harmonization with a '<b><u>countermelody</u></b>' (I use the term loosely). [Solace](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48F18IzQOJA) is the only one I even remotely like, and even then, it's still based off of two short melodies repeated on two instruments for several minutes with a legato strings accompaniment - and it starts with a single high held note or chord over silence, just like Legacy, Haven, Nemesis, Ascendancy, To Galaxy, Immaterial, Arrival (though the chord is in the lower register), Revival, Green and Blue, and to some degree Awakening. That's TEN out of FIFTEEN tracks that aren't remixes, which have a more or less identical opening.

I can do a more extended analysis if you like. You can't possibly think that Davidge's music is more creative than Marty's.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2012-11-16 13:46:49 SocialIssuesAhoy<br>I've been living and breathing fugue #2 for a couple months now (in-depth "study" of it), so hopefully I can help you a little with it. My comments are only directed at the fugue, not at the prelude because I'm not familiar with the prelude beyond having heard it enough times to recognize it, and sightreading it once or twice.

1. I heard at least 7-8 incorrect notes. I bring this up not to shame you or because you're required to play perfectly (I know I make a bunch of mistakes all the time!) BUT most of them sounded like there's a chance they were mistakes which you THINK are correct. I'm not sure this is the case but I'd like to remind you to make sure you're VERY thorough about reading the sheet music and getting everything accurately because there are several accidentals which can easily pass your gaze. Also, look up other people playing it and listen for differing notes, see if there's anything different.

2. I think you should pull back a little on the speed for the fugue. There's a chance that this will feel counterintuitive... at least for me, fugues are these crazy impressive-sounding masterpieces which are dizzyingly fast and complex. But working through it, I know that starting slower is better. It will still sound GREAT (and even fast) to your audience, and you'll make less mistakes and play more confidently which is better of course. Additionally, you can start slower and pick up (SLIGHTLY) throughout the piece to give it a little buildup.

3. In this fugue, there are (in general) 3 voices to keep track of. It's important at any given moment to identify one of them as your lead melody, and bring that one out above the other two. This is done primarily by making that voice the loudest. Now, you may go with a simple "right hand is always the lead" plan and that's okay. But I encourage you to give it a lot of thought and decide whether you'd like one of the other voices to come out more in various parts.

4. With baroque pieces, I believe there's a general unwritten rule about countermelodies (whatever isn't currently the lead) and that is, the countermelodies are played with a slight staccato to them. Not complete staccato, but pulled back at least a little before each note is counted through. By playing your countermelodies detached, and playing your lead melody legato, the lead will become more prominent and easier to follow in the mix of everything. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but this technique comes from the harpsichord which didn't have a way of playing one hand louder than the other. So this was the solution to bring attention to the leading melody.

5. I mentioned speed, and I'd like to bring up adjusting it to help with the big jumps in the piece, because the left hand has 2 or 3 big jumps. You may find it better to SLIGHTLY retard your tempo as you approach the big leaps, and have a slight intentional hesitation before you jump. Then instead of fighting against the jumps (which I initially did), you're incorporating them into your performance.

That's all that comes to mind right now. I don't mean to rip you to shreds or anything, these are simply my observations which you're free to ignore. I think you did a very good job overall, these are things to think about in order to reach the next level of perfecting the piece. Don't forget, no matter what you do, that your performance in the end is subjective. I know, it's a timeless baroque classic and you'll often hear "don't mess with the masterpieces!" but you certainly have some freedom and in the end, you have to decide what you like. My comments are to hopefully educate you a little, and to give you some things to think about and consider.

Cheers!

EDIT:

1. I just remembered. No pedaling!!! I mean I guess technically you could, but it's certainly not in the tradition of baroque/Bach to do so because they didn't even HAVE a damper pedal (they didn't have a piano). You'll lose the punctual nature of the piece of you pedal it.

2. The "big jumps" I referred to aren't just in the left hand, my bad! They are: LH measure 10, LH measure 11, RH measure 14, LH measure 20, LH measure 22, LH measure 23, LH measure 24. These are the measures with a jump greater than an octave, with 16th notes. So the difficulty is playing them smoothly. These are the measures my advice applies to (retard slightly as you approach each one. A tiny hesitation.)

3. I should have clarified my 4th piece of advice. TECHNICALLY baroque style is more about detaching 8th notes (found in the <b><u>countermelody</u></b>) while the lead melody has slurs and/or 16th notes which should all be played legato except for detachments between musical phrases. However, Bach's fugues are a little different. There are no slurs, and at any given point, the lead melody has a mix of 16th and 8th notes. Same with the countermelodies. So strictly baroque-speaking, 8th notes detached, 16th notes connected. But I think you'll find that advice doesn't work as well here. Although it definitely does still work as a general rule to follow.

For examples of more "traditional" baroque playing, you could look at Bach's "inventions". These are pieces with 2-3 melodies which follow what I just said much more closely. Slurs marking phrases, melodies played with 16th notes, countermelodies with detached 8th notes. It's easy to follow :).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2012-11-29 21:58:49 keepingthecommontone<br>I agree that this is a great song... probably my favorite of his so far, and the acoustic version in particular. As is so often the case, I think some of the beauty in the composition goes beyond the notes and chords. Specifically, one of the things I particularly like that is not immediately apparent is that for a large part of the piece the melody is the high guitar part, and the vocals are more of a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. That texture is present in the vamp section you linked to as well, making it less "melody and accompaniment" and more a duet between voice and guitar.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2012-12-03 02:04:09 savagela<br>Something Brahms said has always bothered me. He said an ideal symphony movement has very few melodic elements, and everything in the movement derives from them. 
I could never understand that. You could see it in beethoven's 5th, 1st mvmnt of course, but it was harder to hear in other symphonies. This made it very easy to see, literally see. 
Am I wrong in saying this isn't exactly a fugue? the motive is only 4 notes long, and the <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, the run, is  two measures long. It's treated fugally at the beginning of the phrases, but ends up in a big nice tutti with everyone sawing away on the same melody. 

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2012-12-09 00:18:45 sidran32<br>If I come up with something that I really like but can't make a track surrounding it at the moment, then I'll just mess around with making a loop out of it. Sometimes it happens during composition of another track, or on its own.

If I'm making another song at the time, I'll just make an empty track and throw the loop in there, and save a copy of the project into a new file with that track active.

If possible, though, I'll save it off in its own empty project. I find that even if I can't make a full-length track surrounding a cool melody I just figured out, I can at least add a basic rhythm and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or bassline to go along with it. Then I'll just tweak around with the synth and see how it sounds with different instruments. I won't worry about song structure at this point, as it's just me messing around with no intention of making a new track, yet. I accumulate these (I actually have a couple sitting around that I need to do something with).

If some day I find myself bored and lacking inspiration, I'll open up one of these loops and start messing around with it some more. Sometimes, while listening to it loop over and over again, and me poking things here and there, I'll get a flash of inspiration and take it just enough further that I can start thinking about song structure, and it might turn into a full-length track.

Basically, just play around with it, treating it as a loop, until it starts to become something. Take your time, feel it out, and don't rush it. If you aren't feeling anything, then just close the project and not worry about it. Unless you're on contract, you don't have to turn it into something right then and there. :)
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2012-12-15 05:45:34 Anglach3l<br>Hey, I'm just going to listen and leave feedback as I go.

Cool intro! Haha. Really retro sounds.

Your guitar comes in and out really suddenly. You might consider some sort of effect (maybe a reversed reverb or stab) to bring it in.

Like your percussion sounds. They're punchy enough without being pronounced (like a lot of EDM). Fits the "indie dance" vibe that you're going for, I think.

Mix-wise, the synth-only parts are in a really different acoustic space than the guitar parts. Which might be what you want, but the transition can be jarring when it's so sudden. Try to build up to new sections too! Makes it seem less like they're coming out of nowhere. People like to know what's coming when they're dancing.

Get some velocity going on those hi-hats! They're really static right now, which makes them a bit annoying over time. Also on the note of percussion writing, you might experiment with changing the beat every so often, or even dropping it out for some sections. It'll make things more interesting.

The tune has potential to be really catchy, but I'm left without a really solid hook that I will walk away humming. You might consider playing around with some hook ideas that listeners will get stuck in their head. The higher synth that starts at 1:09 is ALMOST a hook, but sounds more to me like a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> than a hook.

Are you leaving space for vocals? The song totally has enough space for them, and I think they'd really bring this track up a level. It would make all the countermelodies work, it would give the audience the hook they need to get the song in their head. I don't know if you're likely to try that, but I encourage you to give it a shot. 

The guitar starting around 2:55 is playing a cool lead line, but I can hardly hear the higher notes! I just hear the lower chord. It eats up too much space in the mix - makes your percussion/bass weaker, and I really do want to hear the higher notes of the guitar line. I'd make a point of cleaning up your guitar sound however you can, especially for that part.

Cool tune! I think it really fits your "indie dance" target, and there's definitely some really catchy musical ideas. Nicely done. The things I think the track needs are:

1. More subtractive EQ on guitars, possibly a new sound altogether (the current sound sounds pretty practice amp + garagey). Definitely turn them down for the last bit and get that lead line to pop out.

2. Velocity changes on hi-hats! They sound really synthetic without that.

3. Builds. I really want to feel some anticipation before a new section.

4. Acoustic space. A lot of your sounds are really dry - maybe you want that, but it would be worth experimenting with wetter sounds here and there.

5. Vary the energy level! People can't dance at the same intensity for 3 minutes straight. Give them some breaks.

Thanks for sharing your stuff!

Nice kick sound. I can't tell how it hits my chest, obviously, but it sounds very pleasant. Good punch, leaves room for stuff up top.

Love that you're bringing in the new instruments/noise in slowly. Pretty great progression. You're bringing in new elements regularly enough that the song isn't dragging, too. So far it's really well thought out.

Hah, that <b><u>countermelody</u></b> around 3:10 or so is really nice. Really great. I'd be really stoked if you brought it in as a high saw lead on a later drop.

Beauty of a drop around 4:00. Bass is strong without eating the mix. The air adds some nice space but leaves room for the hats.

Great variation at 5:00. If it were a different genre I might say that we're sticking with the same vibe for too long, but I really don't mind it for prog-house. As far as that goes I'd say you're being relatively generous with your switch-ups.

And we're into the outro now! Fantastic work. I really like it. Progressive house isn't a genre I usually have much patience for, but this was a totally enjoyable track to listen to.

The beginning is a little slow to get going, but I assume this is for play on the dance floor, in which case there's no issue there. I dunno man, I try to be pretty critical, but I can't find much to pick on here. It would be worth experimenting with two things:

1. Use the melody from that synth around 3:00 with a huge trance lead on a drop.
2. Vocal samples. Parts of the track totally have space for some female vocals... I think that would sound AMAZING. Really take it over the top and get it in people's heads.

But those are totally optional! I like your mix, arrangement, and writing, so there's not much to criticize as far as my ear goes. Keep it up!

As tjbassoon said, I can give you the whole scoop on jazz bassoonists! But rather than just dropping my dissertation on you, I'll give you a quick overview with some links to stuff that's easy to get your hands on.

The bassoon has been used in jazz since practically the very beginning. The earliest recordings I've found that use bassoon are from the beginning of the 1920s, and the earliest improvised bassoon solo I've located is from 1924 - a bassoonist and saxophonist named [Frankie Trumbauer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Trumbauer) playing with Ray Miller and His Orchestra.

Here's Trumbauer playing bassoon (and C-melody sax) with Joe Venuti's Blue Four in 1929: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqqBtGuQoS8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqqBtGuQoS8)

People (largely sax doublers) have been playing the bassoon in jazz pretty much ever since, with periods of less activity (e.g. bebop) and more activity (e.g. "cool" jazz). One of the first musicians to play *alot* of bassoon in jazz was Errol Buddle, who played bassoon and tenor sax in roughly equal quantities with the Australian Jazz Quartet/Quintet in the 1950s. Here's one of their tracks (not the best, bassoon-wise, but all I could find online): [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPL4Mgz_sw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPL4Mgz_sw)

Dave Brubeck had a bassist who doubled on bassoon (Fred Dutton) in his quartet for a short time. Here's one of the few tunes Dutton recorded with the Quartet: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRQtEPLk3wE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRQtEPLk3wE)

Arranger Gil Evans liked to use bassoon for its tone color (along with things like french horn). He did so in a number of his collaborations with Miles Davis, like Will 'O the Wisp from [*Sketches of Spain*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketches_of_Spain): [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fHUDXf7QnU](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fHUDXf7QnU) (listen for the bassoonist, Jack Knitzer, playing a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> under Miles).


Tenor saxophonist [Illinois Jacquet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Jacquet) picked up bassoon in the 60s and recoded a handful of tunes on it. Here's his solo rendition of 'Round Midnight: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjdrBrAA49k](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjdrBrAA49k)

**And now for some currently-active players:**

[Ray Pizzi](http://www.raypizzi.com/) plays a ton of wind instruments, but has become fairly well known for his bassoon playing. Here he is playing "All the Things You Are" with accordionist Frank Marocco: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjpQzxggqn8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjpQzxggqn8)

[Michael Rabinowitz](http://www.jazzbassoonist.com/) has released five albums of mostly straight-ahead bassoon jazz with his own quartet. He also plays with the Mingus Orchestra: [http://mingusmingusmingus.com/video/3.WolverineBlues.mov](http://mingusmingusmingus.com/video/3.WolverineBlues.mov) (bassoon solo starts at 0:58)

If anyone knows of one jazz bassoonist, it's probably "that one guy who played with Bela Fleck and the Flecktones," A.K.A. [Paul Hanson](http://paulhansonmusic.com/). Paul is known for his fusion playing often using various electronic effects, but he plays all sorts of stuff. Here he is laying down "Donna Lee" solo: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuYE5G1C9MQ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuYE5G1C9MQ) (many more things on his [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/jazzbassoonpaul/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0)).

Alexandre Silverio is a Brazilian bassoonist who plays both classical and jazz. No album yet, but he's got some YouTube videos. Here's Coltrane's "Naima": [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5MRvjuvvVY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5MRvjuvvVY)



Ok... that should be plenty to get you started. There's more from every player I mentioned, and there are a **ton** of players and bands I didn't get to. My discography currently stands at about 1000 items, and I'm adding stuff all the time. Have fun!


</p></li><li><p><b>funny</b> 2013-01-01 02:17:56 wachet<br>It's from the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> from "Do-Re-Mi" in the Sound of Music
</p></li><li><p><b>chiptunes</b> 2013-01-19 21:21:25 stu556<br>Nice job!

The layering work is good, but at about 00:29, the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> is a bit muddled sounding and could use some mid-range boosting so that it isn't obscured by the bass.
</p></li><li><p><b>ThisIsOurMusic</b> 2013-01-27 09:35:07 ACrowLeft06<br>Overall, great sound. This is something I'd definitely pay to see live and would listen to now and again.

"Comet Chaser" Seemed to lack a sustainable melody during the verses which left me wishing there vocals. The tremolo guitar just didn't hook me enough, and I would have liked to hear more development, whether it's increase in texture, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, or just a different melody overall. However, the slower section was really enjoyable.

"Concrete Sky" has a nice overall sound. Where you lost me was in the drum sampling. I found it a little excessive. I feel as if it would be more effective if used a little more sparingly. During the latter third, either a guitar or keyboard solo (not quite sure of your instrumentation) would help add some interest.

"Architect" is the strongest track in my opinion. It really held me throughout the whole song, and was quite satisfying.

Keep up the good work, guys.

It sounds kind of baroque to me, think De Visee or Weiss maybe. Do you know how to modulate? You've already got a nice melody/<b><u>countermelody</u></b>; you could take it further by modulating to the subdominant, dominant, or maybe relative major. This would give the tune a feeling of development, and then wrap it up by returning to the original key/melody. BOOM! Instant song.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-02-09 18:49:38 mikeoquinn<br>I'm not an expert, but I've given this a lot of thought over the past few years as I've sought to understand Irish music in order to arrange traditional pieces in what I hope are fun and invigorating ways, without sacrificing the tradition that gave them birth.

This will not be over quickly. Brain-dump incoming.

* **Step 1: Cut a hole in the box.**

Maybe I'm thinking of something else...

* **Step 2: Listen to a ton of Celtic music**

No, seriously, do it.

A couple of years back, at the [O'Flaherty Irish Music Retreat](http://www.oflahertyretreat.org), one of the instructors was leading a session on teaching Irish music, no matter your skill level. It was really cool for a number of reasons, but one thing he mentioned was this concept of listening casually vs. listening critically.

Listening casually is what most folks do in the car, at the gym, in elevators, etc. It's listening to the music for the sake of the music. With regards to Irish music, the biggest difference between a musician born in Ireland and one not is the fact that it's more likely that the native will grow up listening casually to the music, at pubs, on the radio, at home, etc. Casual listening is what builds familiarity with the style, builds a brain-database of sounds and combinations and expectations. It's what gives you the burst of inspiration at a session that leads to something awesome - you hear something you can do in your head, and you just do it, knowing where you're going because you've already heard other people do _that thing_ or something like it.

Listening critically is another beast altogether. This is listening to your work or the work of others with a critical ear to find out _why_ and _how_ the music happened, what pieces came together to make it _just so_. This is sitting down with a piece you really like and banging away at it until you find the chord structure. This is listening to a session and thinking "That tune flowed into the next one because the first ended on the tonic, which served as the pickup note for the next tune, and it was really brought together by the fiddles' doublestop happening _just so_ with the new V chord the guitarist played."

This instructor had apparently suggested this to a comrade of his who was born into the Irish musical tradition, and he responded that to do something like that would be like studying a butterfly - an act which typically requires that you first kill a beautiful creature and place it on a pin, nevermore to entrance and delight as it once did. It's like watching a magician and figuring out how he does that trick you loved as a kid: unless you're one of those rare few who still believe in the magic after you know how it works, it turns something magical into something mundane.

My suggestion to anyone who wants to start playing Irish music is to make an ever-growing playlist of Irish music and listen to it non-stop. Steep yourself in it. For a lot of us (myself included), we're making up for lost time, so dive in and don't look back for a good long while (for me it was 6 months, nonstop on the drive to work, all day at work, on the drive home, and any time my wife wasn't at home). It's important to note that I mean this as a casual listener.

For someone who wants to improve their skill, or - as you do - wants to break the music down into its nuts and bolts so that they can reassemble it themselves, it's important to listen critically, too; however, don't try and do the two at the same time. Casual listening has a specific purpose; critical listening has a separate one. The two don't work together, though.

* **Step 3: Read up on modes**

A lot of Celtic music probably isn't in the key you think it's in.

One of the gents at the music retreat I linked to above teaches a class on music theory in Irish music. He has a chart he made showing the distribution of the top &lt;some number here that I can't recall off top of my head&gt; most popular tunes from thesession.org and similar sites. "Major"-sounding tunes were split fairly evenly between Ionian and Mixolydian (tending to lean one way or the other based on the tonic - lots more G Ionian than G Mix; lots more A Mix than A Ionian), but "minor"-sounding tunes were astoundingly _not_ Aeolian. I don't have the chart sitting in front of me, but it was in the range of 2-5%. The rest were overwhelmingly Dorian.

Dr. Chris Smith has some great [educational materials](http://coyotebanjo.com/music-group-28.html) up on his personal website, and I'll specifically draw your attention to [Modes and Modal Substitution](http://coyotebanjo.com/music-38.html), though there are countless other writings you can find on the topic as well.

Oh, and whatever you know about chord progressions, set it aside for a while as you work on new music. The modal - sometimes indiscriminately so - nature of the music means that many songs _can_ be played straight I-IV-V, but many, many more receive added depth and nuance when the chords are played without thirds, or when chords are substituted, or when chords aren't played at all, instead relying on a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or drone accompaniment style. The choice of DADGAD guitar will help with this, actually. I promise I'm in no way related to or associated with Chris Smith aside from having been a student of his three years ago at the O'Flaherty retreat, but his [book](http://www.melbay.com/Products/97205BCD/celtic-backup-for-all-instrumentalists.aspx) on Celtic backup is amazing, and between his instruction in-person and following up with that book, I can honestly say I discovered how to accompany Irish music (I'm still working on perfecting it, but at least I know how to get there).

* **Step 4: Choose what you want to write**

If it's tunes, focus on the melody and ignore chord structures, harmonies, etc.

If it's songs, focus on the story - what makes a great song of _any_ origin is a compelling story. Once the story is there, treat it as a tune, above.

If it's _compositions_, take it a step at a time. Find the hook, find the melody, then find accompaniment. Celtic music survived for years without anything supplementing the melody, save for an occasional drone. If adding a harmony or accompaniment part adds nothing to the melody, consider whether it's worth it. Some of the most moving performances I've heard are a single fiddle, a single voice, a single bagpipe - for all its ornamentation, this is a simple musical tradition, and sometimes sounds best when allowed to be simple.

At the end of the day, it's my opinion that Celtic music is no less alive now than it was a hundred years ago - in fact, perhaps moreso. And by 'alive', I don't mean 'frequently-performed'. I mean _alive_, the same way that a talented speaker can make you see the future or relive the past through their words.

tl;dr - I'm a windbag, not a trash compactor. Read it if you're interested.

Inca Roads you could probably do with a little creativity...have the bass play the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> (the vibe parts, etc).

Peaches En Regalia could probably work, cover the horn parts on guitar.

</p></li><li><p><b>trumpet</b> 2013-03-01 13:48:26 Yeargdribble<br>Was sitting in rehearsal and just decided to start taking pictures of the more ludicrous pages... not like I was doing much else.  Seriously, there are a  lot of footballs in a sea of rests.  Hey, I also get to play a breve.  How exciting.  Generally the arranging is abysmal.  The arranger seems to be thinking, "I want strings, but I want them louder" and then brings in the trumpet for the very last statement of any given theme in a particular song.  Also, they found it somehow compelling to pretty much always written sax, trumpet, trombone, and horn in unison for certain parts, even those with easily definable harmony or <b><u>countermelody</u></b> parts.

Most of my time is spend counting... even on tacet numbers.  For anyone familiar with the show, it's one of those where the music essentially never stops, and there's a lot of odd and mixed meter stuff so you have to stay on top of it.  After some rehearsals I've figured out where I can just clock out and read a book for the most part, but there are plenty of songs where I have to keep an eye on 200+ rest to make a 4 bar statement with tacet numbers two deep on either side.

But hey, I'm getting paid the same as the strings who never get to put their bows down so it's really a first world problem.
</p></li><li><p><b>radiohead</b> 2013-03-02 15:44:39 CivilDiscobedience<br>For me, it's definitely two things: vocal layering and strings.

The <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that begins in the second verse is great, and when it swells to multiple harmonies by the end it's lovely. But then, when everything cuts out and moves to the wordless choir, and adds the strings there to the end - magnificent. I find that the additive process is something I enjoy most about lots of Radiohead songs, and they employ that in Reckoner so subtly, so seamlessly, and so well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-03-08 12:33:01 LookLikeJesus<br>Oh man I love talking about the funk.  libcrypto is right in saying that the funk don't need no smartifying.  But there are some cool things to talk about.

P-Funk isn't composed, it's grown.  You create a fertile environment, and you water it with emotion and you get funk.  Which means, it's based on a groove (on the one!), and whatever you want to put on that, you put on that.  George Clinton guides the whole thing in a loose way, singing a particular riff or <b><u>countermelody</u></b> until it gets picked up, running around stage putting his vocal mic up to particular musicians who are doing something he wants at the forefront.  As he says, "When in doubt vamp, or at least ad lib!"  Also, "ain't nothing good unless you play with it."  So play.
</p></li><li><p><b>radiohead</b> 2013-03-30 02:24:14 pwebsers<br>Really cool! This is awesome to listen to.

 If I were you I would have probably given more melody/<b><u>countermelody</u></b> to one of the horns, it seems like you really only used them for accentuation an color. But hey, what do I know, right?   
p.s. whoever did the vocals did a really awesome job. Was that you singing?
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2013-04-24 11:55:33 pianoplayah<br>Depends on what type of music your band will be playing. Is it rock and roll? Funk? Jazz? Blues? Gospel? Folk? I can give you some recommendations depending on your band's style. But really, you should play like whatever pianists YOU like to listen to, combined with how this particular group makes you feel like playing. :)

Also, I would add that the most important thing you can do is when you are playing with your band, to listen very carefully to the other musicians. It can be very easy to get really into playing and without realizing it be playing all over the other musicians and getting in the way of what they are doing. Listen, and try to play something that will complement what they are doing. And they should do the same for you. For instance, if you have a guitar player and you are both playing chords (comping), try to play something in a different register from what they guitarist is doing. If they are playing chords in the middle octave, try playing chords or a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in a higher octave, so you're not both playing things that mush together. Or, if your guitarist is playing a solo, try to play a little quieter, or more sparsely so that people can hear them better. And when it's your turn to solo, your guitarist should play softer as well! Playing in a band is all about listening to each other and playing things that go well together.

</p></li><li><p><b>denvermusic</b> 2013-05-03 13:48:35 SmartieSquirt<br>I really enjoyed it. My only suggestion would be to make the guitar in the beginning a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to the vocals (as opposed to matching them). That's just a personal preference thing, though. Your harmonies and texture are solid. I'm loving that this 80's-esque alt pop is re-emerging, and you guys are a great example.

Speaking of the chords, they could use something to make them more interesting than just a long drone. Maybe arpeggiate them just at the start of each held chord? Maybe arpeggios all around? I dunno, play with it, see if it sounds better. I can't really tell unless I hear it. 

The leads in the first portion need, nay, *deserve* an echo. A stereo panning echo would work wonders, and honestly the bass could also benefit from a slight echo.

&gt;The earliest recordings I've found that use bassoon are from the beginning of the 1920s, and the earliest improvised bassoon solo I've located is from 1924 - a bassoonist and saxophonist named Frankie Trumbauer playing with Ray Miller and His Orchestra.

&gt;People (largely sax doublers) have been playing the bassoon in jazz pretty much ever since, with periods of less activity (e.g. bebop) and more activity (e.g. "cool" jazz). One of the first musicians to play a lot of bassoon in jazz was Errol Buddle, who played bassoon and tenor sax in roughly equal quantities with the Australian Jazz Quartet/Quintet in the 1950s. Here's one of their tracks (not the best, bassoon-wise, but all I could find online): [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPL4Mgz_sw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPL4Mgz_sw)
&gt;
&gt;Dave Brubeck had a bassist who doubled on bassoon (Fred Dutton) in his quartet for a short time. Here's one of the few tunes Dutton recorded with the Quartet: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRQtEPLk3wE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRQtEPLk3wE)
&gt;
&gt;Arranger Gil Evans liked to use bassoon for its tone color (along with things like french horn). He did so in a number of his collaborations with Miles Davis, like Will 'O the Wisp from Sketches of Spain: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fHUDXf7QnU](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fHUDXf7QnU) (listen for the bassoonist, Jack Knitzer, playing a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> under Miles).
&gt;
&gt;Tenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet picked up bassoon in the 60s and recoded a handful of tunes on it. Here's his solo rendition of 'Round Midnight: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjdrBrAA49k](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjdrBrAA49k)
&gt;
&gt;And now for some currently-active players:
&gt;
&gt;Ray Pizzi plays a ton of wind instruments, but has become fairly well known for his bassoon playing. Here he is playing "All the Things You Are" with accordionist Frank Marocco: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjpQzxggqn8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjpQzxggqn8)
&gt;
&gt;Michael Rabinowitz has released five albums of mostly straight-ahead bassoon jazz with his own quartet. He also plays with the Mingus Orchestra: [http://mingusmingusmingus.com/video/3.WolverineBlues.mov](http://mingusmingusmingus.com/video/3.WolverineBlues.mov) (bassoon solo starts at 0:58)
&gt;
&gt;If anyone knows of one jazz bassoonist, it's probably "that one guy who played with Bela Fleck and the Flecktones," A.K.A. Paul Hanson. Paul is known for his fusion playing often using various electronic effects, but he plays all sorts of stuff. Here he is laying down "Donna Lee" solo: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuYE5G1C9MQ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuYE5G1C9MQ) (many more things on his YouTube channel).
&gt;
&gt;Alexandre Silverio is a Brazilian bassoonist who plays both classical and jazz. No album yet, but he's got some YouTube videos. Here's Coltrane's "Naima": [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5MRvjuvvVY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5MRvjuvvVY)

And there's plenty more where that came from!

However, repeating the first part of the melody in a different key has a very emotive feel to me that I wouldn't want to part with. However, I could interweave some very minimal <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to evoke more emotion. I will look into that.

Somewhere along the way those "epic" chord progressions really connected with you, whether that was the first "Great" song to you or whatever, but now when you hear that you are flooded with endorphins.  The way to write that stuff is the do the "Aristotelian" method and find all (or a lot of songs) that give you that rush and analyze why that is happening.  For example, for me I love songs with slow melodic low parts, <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the high brass and fast driving stuff in the high winds. (Think The battle from Chronicles of Narnia) so just figure out exactly what causes that for you and replicate it.

[This moment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYl6iI4l9gA#t=24m32) in the slow movement of the "Emperor" concerto, when the clouds roll away and you can see all the stars.

[The <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the second movement of the Trout Quintet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jRWFKl8Feg#t=11m22) is a profound moment of despair in the middle of such a jolly piece.

The noisiest thing I've ever heard is [after "Hoiho! Hoihohoho!" in the second act of Götterdämmerung, but then just when you think your eardrums are gone for good, the entire thing suddenly settles down into a soft, solemn procession of "Heil dir, Gunther" (which eventually spans the entire dynamic range, of course).](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTV0s605-cw#t=8m40)

At the end of Franck's piano quintet, [the music builds up into a bigger and bigger climax until the pianist just brutally pounds CHORD! CHORD! CHORD! CHORD!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU6BHCNkZWM#t=9m20)

At the end (always the ends, huh?) of the first movement of Beethoven's "Harp" quartet, [Master Beet calls upon the first violinist to shred](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq732JLrYPA#t=7m). I assume he thought it would be funny to see Ignaz Schuppanzigh, whom he loved to insult for his weight, do that.

As the theme and variations in Tchaikovsky's piano trio build up to a climax, [it suddenly takes a wrong turn and ends up as a tremendous recap of the first movement's main theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GAatbgHKUU#t=50m). Then it just dies, and so do I.

And, of course, the end of the third movement of Schnittke's piano quintet, where [the incessant droning single-pitch pulse that's been going on for most of the movement fades away until it's no more than soft thump of the pianist pumping the pedal without any actual finger movements](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mMMvQb3Fwg#t=5m).
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2013-06-03 00:27:07 dkinmn<br>Before I hear anything:

Rehearse. Sound good in a room together. Play together live. Use room mics. Use less guitar overdrive than you think you should. Keep things simple. 

Make sure you have a point of interest throughout each song, and don't muddy things by being too busy. Support the melody, provide a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.
 

Think about taking a dry guitar direct so that you can reamp later if that's necessary.

Work with an engineer you trust and use their ears. Don't let mixing and arranging become a point of debate among the band at the recording and mixing stage. That doesn't help anything. Relax into your songs play them well, and trust the engineer. 
</p></li><li><p><b>DaftPunk</b> 2013-06-04 00:35:19 jakimovskik<br>I see what you're saying about the lower register being the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> (which I would say that it is not always acting as a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, sometimes it's just a lower register reflection of the melody), but I am pretty sure that (at least in the chorus) there are four vocal tracks. Upper and lower registers that are noticeable throughout the song, as well two mid range harmonizing vocal tracks (that seem to be on the left and right channel).
</p></li><li><p><b>Awesomenauts</b> 2013-06-10 03:26:31 Slash_Face_Palm<br>It's good, and I like it, but... unlike Ayla's theme, it doesn't really have any parts that "Stick out". It feels like it stays the same volume and intensity, without really going anywhere. 

The best tip I could give you is to boost your bass, and maybe add a <b><u>Countermelody</u></b>. Even better, diversify your instruments. The Timpani / Bass sounds and Orchestral / Choral / Guitar / Melody sound too similar, and make it mushy.

I like it, and if it's your first mix, It's a good step; you could certainly do WAY Worse. :D

This is from The enigma variations, which  has the weirdest theme I've ever heard. It jumps up and down and seems like a background melody rather than the theme. Each variation is meant as a portrait of the people in his life, and you can hear their  personalities. Nimrod ties the melody together in such beautiful ways and the grandeur sneaks up on you
Elgar put a puzzle in there, but the Enigma has never been solved. Some say that it's a variation on the Lutheran hymn, like a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, but no one has cracked it completely.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB2iYG0qAzI

When I finally had the opportunity to compose for a (platforming) game called [Mack vs Windows](http://www.mackvswindows.com), I decided to leave behind my old mentality of ambience and really develop a strong melody that I could use throughout the game.

---
One important thing to note with melodies is avoiding getting hooked to a melody that might be catchy (as in, gets stuck in your head) but isn't really malleable (as in, you can actually use it for more than just the melody). One example I can give from my personal archive is the first test song I made for the game [(Link!)](http://jtjolsen.com/storage/music/Fullscreen3.mp3). It's clearly incredibly repetitive in retrospect, but when I made the initial leitmotif, I really felt like I had something with it, as did the team lead. After trying to make it work for a long time, I pretty much canned it and forced myself to make a new melody, as it was hard to build off of.

Instead, I went with something more melodical, something that could have a bit more depth and leeway if I chose, as well a picking chords that I knew could work without the melody for when I felt it wasn't necessary [(Link!)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfS6TBx7TLs). Also, a remix of the original song made an appearance as the credits theme, which was a personal decision to beckon back with a little flair [(Link!)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuzv8CK0XLQ).
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2013-07-04 04:33:24 mridlen<br>You just have to write melody until it comes naturally. Expose yourself to a lot of different genres, and spend time studying the melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> structure (i.e. listening for the rhythm and relative pitches). I recommend taking up jamming (playing a new and different part along to an existing song). Learning music theory helps, but it's no substitute for intuitive experience.

There's basically a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the chords where they progress from one tone to the next. 

The chords are almost the hero of the piece. So maybe if you had a smoother, more melodic and tight metamorphosis going on in the chords it could work.
</p></li><li><p><b>AdviceAnimals</b> 2013-07-18 09:18:50 Reflexlon<br>The other guy didn't get it quite right.

Melody is the primary line of music, generally the soloist or singer. Its what you hum.

Rhythm is a musical descriptor focused on the length and structure of notes. Its the "pattern" so to speak.

Beat is a method of measuring the length and timing of notes.

The Rhythm Section is generally behind Melody and <b><u>Countermelody</u></b>, and is often focused on giving something for the other parts to keep time with.

Most of the musical words being thrown around here are inaccurate, because a lot of popular music is "drums are time, bass is loud, and the singer is the only one who doesn't repeat himself (optional)." These aren't necessarily bad things, just a familiar archetype.
</p></li><li><p><b>electronicmusic</b> 2013-07-18 10:04:53 reminiscence<br>the [live version](http://youtu.be/qeDhay10CWE) of this song is currently one of my favs. The acoustic piano <b><u>countermelody</u></b> is soooo sick.

I love how the rhythm of 'You've got to get mad' suddenly pops up and works perfectly against the music.

I'm not quite sure about the fading out snare before the big drop - perhaps a half-time snare with delay and a bit more crack (maybe even heavily high-passed) would work here.

Years after that discovery, I was listening to a lecture by Leonard Bernstein, and he talked about discovering this same <b><u>countermelody</u></b> after listening to and conducting the work many, many times. He was illustrating the hidden details in great works of art. I was all impressed with myself at discovering something as a teenager that Bernstein hadn't discovered until he was a seasoned vet,  but in reality we discover different details at different times.
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2013-08-13 21:08:22 YourFavoriteBandSux<br>I sure hope you take everyone's advice. I'm not sure English has a word that accurately explains just how unrealistic your goal is.

You first need to learn about the instrument, what it can do for you, and what you can do for it.  Your first goal should be to learn how to play the bass, not how to play a song.

Find a simpler song you like, and start there. You're clearly a metal fan; how about starting with some old Sabbath?  Some of Geezer's lines are really interesting, and can give you some ideas regarding timing, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and supporting the rest of the song.  If you can master, say, Iron Man or Paranoid - and by master, I mean play it comfortably without notes, tabs, slowing down, etc. - then you're playing bass.

While you're learning, you'll start to learn how to hold the instrument comfortably, how to make notes sound nice, how to make notes stop when you want them to, etc.  Without all that, you're going to get frustrated really quickly.

I've been playing bass for ~25 years, and I still sit and play scales with a metronome. The better you get, the better the musicians around you get. My drummer is awesome, and I don't want to let him down by wrecking his groove.  Playing an instrument is a process, not a destination.

Soon you'll want to learn more about key signatures, and scales, and all the other cool things you get to discover. Don't burn yourself out early by starting with something you can't do.

Good luck, and keep coming back here for advice and motivation.

</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2013-08-20 21:13:27 a-Centauri<br>I just wrote up a long thing and accidentally hit the back button... 

This was more on the [minimalist movement in art music of the '60s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_music) I'm pretty sure a lot of the principles apply to the EDM scene, too.

The four techniques as I remember them are:

1. Container fill: The step sequencer (or bar if that's the sheet music term) is your container. Over time, you fill it by adding one or two beats at a time. [Reich's Drumming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USRGNr17Jm4) is a great example.

2. Phasing: There are two channels, a melody and either a copy of the melody, a harmony or a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. One channel is played faster than the other so they kind of cross in and out of eachother. They can either speed up or speed up then slow down. [Here's a song called  'It's Gonna Rain'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anXcSl5uFig). Steve Reich pioneered phasing, and this is one of the songs that shows it well. He actually cut up tape in a cassette to do this.

3. Augmentation: I thought it meant slowly changing the length of the chords or notes in the melody to change the feel of the song, but another site I found says this and I can't decode it: "this is where the not values are doubled in length i.e. a crochet becomes a minim." So there's that. [Four Organs uses this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLR5wnnP91E). For some reason I can only remember Steve Reich's works...

4. Melodic transformation – That site says "gradually changing from one motif to another by way of small changes i.e. you could replace a C for a C# and then a D." I just saw it as changing the melody one note at a time. I don't know about the motif thing. I like [Mr. Carmack's 'Practice What You Fucking Preach](https://soundcloud.com/mr_carmack/practice-what-you-fucking).

There's a few more minor things listed on [this page](http://musicatschool.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/minimalist-composing-techniques/) if you're interested, and I could find more examples of the music we listened to if you want!
</p></li><li><p><b>writing</b> 2013-08-22 06:04:16 Creedelback<br>This is interesting. I remember reading about how Aaron Copland copied one of Mahler's symphonies by hand to learn how to orchestrate.

I ended up trying the same thing with Copland's third symphony. I got about 6 pages into the first movement. It was an interesting exercise. I learned a lot about how to write for transposed instruments (like the B-flat clarinet or the french horn which is in F), but I don't know how much I picked up in regards to when and why different voices came in.

It may have been because music is conceived of both linearly and stacked--meaning some instruments have their own melody or <b><u>countermelody</u></b> while others operate in a more obbligato fashion to fill in the harmonic gaps--and if you don't copy the staves out in the right order, you don't really get inside of the composer's head.  Meaning, I may have been doing it backwards, copying out something Copland composed in relation to a melodic line he had conceived of and written out first.

Of course, novel writing is different.  And while they are indeed read sequentially, I'd argue very few of them are written that way.

Copying out a novel may give you a bit of an insight into sentence structure, but I can't see it being effective beyond that. Besides, sentences, a lot like music, have a rhythm to them. Something I'm not sure is apparent when transcribing it.

So my vote is for not helpful.
</p></li><li><p><b>TheDearHunter</b> 2013-08-22 07:44:46 Iamkazam<br>Oh, hi Casey! I'm a huge fan of your music and I'm really excited about the symphony! I'm always blown away by how crazy complex everything on Act II is, just had to get that out :)

But yeah, in rock music you don't really have to pay a huge amount of attention to how instruments play against each other in terms of timbre and tone. Every instrument (guitars, bass, etc.) can be doing their own thing at a single dynamic for the entire song and can be fine. But with a symphony each instrument is so different and has it's own place, and they each have to have their parts carefully written. If a piccolo melody doesn't make sense in terms of what the low brass is playing or what the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> is playing, something has to change or be rewritten in some way. It's a very delicate balance between instruments in symphonic music. Dynamic, or volume, is super important. Every instrument or group of instruments has to be balanced with each other and with the other sections in terms of volume and intonation, with no one section overpowering the others. Sorry for the wall of text, it's really surreal to be talking about music and giving advice to one of my all-time favorite musicians!

But you're right that it's mostly about what you hear in your head and how you can get that into music form. If you don't have a well defined idea in your mind you can't really get anywhere.

I'm super stoked to hear you're writing a symphony and can't wait to hear it! Best of luck :D
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2013-08-24 23:25:52 wait_im_a_douchebag<br>Depending on the DAW you're using, this could be easy or hard. I don't know how Kontakt works, but try making four different instrument tracks (cello, 2 violins, and viola), EQing them individually, and having each play its own melody in its own octave. So, if you're in A minor, have the cello play a melody mostly between A1 and A2, have each violin play its own melody between A2 and A3 and A3 and A4, respectively, and have the viola play between A4 and A5. You can use bass strings, but I find sine subs complement strings really nicely.

Once I have those set up, I like to take the chord progression I'm using in my song and separate it out among 3 of the instruments. I'll mute all the voices except one for each instrument, transpose them to a specific octave. <b><u>Countermelody</u></b> always sounds good, so try to have one voice go up while another goes down. Add some appropriate highlights (have all the voices play the same note, have some voices play two or three notes in the space that others play one, have one of the voices play two notes below the root, a seventh, to add a tense feeling between sadness and happiness, etc.), and you should have a pretty good sound.

Gods damn it; it's a [three-way tie](http://i.imgur.com/2hWzO2B.png).

[Sootopolis City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CIWGRkOUd8) has the coolest additions.  9/8 timing is very difficult and yet it's pulled off masterfully, the counterpoint in the background is superb, and it feels really really...sootopolis.  Such fitting music for a city that is the ultimate balance between land and sea.  The marimbas and flute duet give the song a great tropical vibe, and the trumpets combined with the piano in the later verses take you out of that trance with incredible taste.  The saxophone...or cors d'anglais...or whatever it is that follows makes for a nice mix of the two before it loops back.

[Ever Grande City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtcUCMuHP4M) has a spectacular melody combined with a brilliant key change that makes you feel like you're ascending in pitch and excitement...not to mention a touch of anxiety.  This is the happy tune you'll be hearing before you step in to challenge the Elite Four.  Stepping out of Victory road gives you a feeling of "I've made it this far; I'm so proud of myself."  And what better a way to reinforce that statement than with tubular bells and a trumpet ~~glissando~~ brilliante?

[Littleroot Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYV_-mOoO5U) is...home.  It may not be the most spectacular or the most exciting town you know, but it's certainly the friendliest.  Littleroot is the place you know you can rely on when you need support when you're down.  It's where you know that you matter; where there will always be someone whom you love waiting for you.  And the melody that you hear fits that with more grace, pomp, and musical prose than any other melody I can imagine.  After biking back home, swelling with joy with the fact you have become the very best, the first thing you hear is a soft flute (I think) coupled with stringed pizzicattos followed by the whole string ensemble, playing con affetto alongside a soft percussion and a reinforced <b><u>countermelody</u></b>; all of which is calling out to you, singing the phrase "welcome back home."

I know I'm romanticizing these themes a little bit, but it's all to enunciate my point: I can't choose.  They're all spectacular in their own ways.
</p></li><li><p><b>gypsyjazz</b> 2013-09-06 13:36:38 davewells<br>I say: just try it! Just because Django didn't have a trombonist in his quintet doesn't mean that you can't find a way to make it fit. I'm the horn player in my band, and although I play some clarinet and sax, mostly I play bassoon. There's zero precedent for that. But, we've found lots of ways that we think it really works - melody on some tunes, harmony or <b><u>countermelody</u></b> on others, and even sometimes as sort of a secondary bass line.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2013-09-09 03:16:18 dcurry431<br>Not that you're specifically doing this, but often a good drop has a good melody to it, and it complements the buildup.  If you're coming at this entirely from an audio science viewpoint, you'll miss that.  The guys who I'd consider to make the best drops also tend to be insanely musical, guys like Feed Me and Noisia.

A satisfying drop usually fills all frequencies (though not at once), leaving no bald patches.  I'm sure you know about cutting the lows gradually before your drop so it hits with more force and all, so I think your best solution is a more tension-filled builup that the drop resolves, be it by completing a chord or introducing a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or something original.

I'd guess you're having more music problems than electronic producton problems.

I've been studying tis style the last few months and it's all about group improvisation. They compliment each other beautifully. In this style of jazz the trumpet is traditionally the lead while the clarinet plays an arpegiated <b><u>countermelody</u></b> line. She gets out of his way while he's playing that badass growling solo and then resumes the lead for the rest of the tune. Also check out this performance. The singer, Erica Lewis, melts my soul. (there's also some great clarinet work. )

I love listening to harmonies and you do a good job mixing melody with <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. 

The distortion on the guitar was a little too raunchy for the silkiness of the voices and its relatively quiet volume. It sounds like it was applied in post-production. If I were you I'd get a tube amp to make the distortion sound awesome. If I'm mistaken and you already have one, get a better method for recording or mixing the guitar, so the distortion doesn't sound like it was played through a stool.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-09-27 09:02:24 keakealani<br>Well, it's not directly related, but one area of theory you can study is counterpoint. If the goal is to create an interesting, distinct <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the bass that interacts in a consonant but independent fashion from the soprano/melody, then counterpoint rules could be very useful. That's one angle to look at it.

The other is to study harmony. Since bass lines are traditionally the harmonic foundation, it's very important to understand how harmonies relate to each other. As a pianist/guitarist, you should probably also be familiar with standard harmonic language, and this can absolutely translate to bass lines which exist in tandem with the harmonic movement. 

A third thought is to study figured bass. I'm not sure if you're talking about specific contexts where figured bass is directly applicable, but it's really an interesting place to study a harmonic language that is so focused on the bass line and the harmonic realizations on top of it. Again as a pianist this shouldn't be too difficult - most pianists I know have some experience with figured bass realization already. So I'd definitely consider revisiting that material, and in particular studying the way bass lines effectively imply harmonic function and what happens on top of that to reinforce the harmony. 

Beyond that, I don't really think there is any better way to learn about bass lines than to just study them. Is there a reason that isn't working for you?

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2013-10-08 15:04:37 mridlen<br>After spending about 15 years doing what you're doing (and making a lot of mistakes along the way), I'd say to prioritize things in this order:

1) Sound design - learn all the knobs in all the plugins you plan on using. Learn it as soon as humanly possible because if you've been at this 5 years, you'll probably be doing this for the rest of your life. I spent 10 years at waist deep level instead of diving in headfirst in the first couple years. I recommend learning a modular because hard-wired architecture is hard to learn unless you know what each piece does.

2) Arrangement - learn music theory and give your tracks proper sonic space (i.e. don't put in clashing <b><u>countermelody</u></b>). Don't ignore sub bass. Learn good transitions and drum fills. Avoid cliches sometimes. A good sounding song is mostly in the arrangement, so don't spend a lot of time mixing unless your arrangement is solid (can be frustrating otherwise).

3) Mixing and Mastering - Learn the finer points of subtractive EQing, Compression, Limiting, Tube Simulation, Color. If you give your productions that "sparkle" of a professional track, it makes a big difference to you and others.

4) Learn an instrument. If you have a keyboard or MPC - learn it. Guitar is probably insanely helpful to know, depending on genre. Learn scales, keys, and modes. Some people write really akward synth lines that really show a lack of keyboard playing. I sequence almost everything, but it still makes a huge difference to be able to play something and then noodle around and flesh it out a little more on the keyboard. Pay very close attention to note length, portamento/glide, and envelopes.

5) Creativity is king. If you're not having fun, if the song doesn't speak to you, you're not being creative enough. It's easier to keep producing when you don't feel like it's work. Once your skill level plateaus (I'd guess at this point you're still improving?), spend more time per song getting the details right, adding drum fills, orchestrating it, etc.

Keep doing what you're doing. If you do all those things, it doesn't matter what genre you write in. In fact, I recommend producing in as many genres as possible because genres can be blended to your liking.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-10-22 12:31:13 xiipaoc<br>Which is more important, the guitar part or the vocals?  You can always turn the amp down on the guitar and turn the amp up on the vocals, if there's a balance issue, but if the issue is more conceptual, pick which one is the actual melody and write the other part around it.  Presumably the vocals win, so write the vocals first and put a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the guitar.

</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2013-10-29 22:39:57 bigblucrayon<br>okay, first thing I have to ask about is your third chord in your 4 bar harmony:

is it set to an open fifth on purpose? because i'd like it better if you gave it some color with a major/minor third as you have done well with your other chords.

two: your octave melody in the right hand. I would suggest adding some harmony with your free fingers inside the octave that match what chord you are playing. also while doing this, analyze what is going on with those added notes and see if you can come up with <b><u>countermelody</u></b> within those octaves. doing so adds depth to your melody and gives more than one thing to pay attention to as a listener.

overall i like your unique harmonic progression: i - vii6 - V5 - V(6/3) and again, about that third chord: give it a third unless you're purposely omitting it; it sounds kinda awkward when put next to three other fully flourished chords. I would recommend a minor V if you're going to go to a first inversion major V - i right after. I upvoted this and thumbed up the YouTube video as I see this piece has good potential.

EDIT: also try experimenting with sevenths, ninths, and diminished chords. they really add movement and flavor to your piece.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-11-06 03:54:41 -fd-<br>Actually there is a rule for 7ths (which of course can be broken). 

1. You can use the 7 if its in the melody (or <b><u>countermelody</u></b> depending on how you're working)

You can use a 7 whenever, except....

2. If the root of the chord is in the melody, don't use a major 7. Eg if you have a C in your melody, don't use a Cmaj7 chord because it clashes. Dom and minor 7 aren't such a problem because there is a whole tone between the 7 and the root note.

3. Generally, keep your 7ths diatonic. I.e naturally occurring from the scale.

As I said, this gets broken with wonderful effect all the time and some genres of music don't follow this rule. But if you start with this then when you break it, it will be intentional and you can start to use it for good effect.

There is a really useful jazz harmony workbook I can recommend if anyone wants it, just   PM me.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-11-26 06:37:57 SocialIssuesAhoy<br>Basically look up examples of polytonal music to hear it, Bartok's a good example. I think practically speaking, polytonality is a similar tool to synthetic scales, pretty much giving you a new set of harmonic combinations to work with.

For some personal commentary: try thinking about it as moving between consonance and dissonance more than anything else. Choose two keys ahead of time, and try to think about what consonant intervals you can get from them, and use those as "key points". It's really a mental exercise at first, until you have a comfortable feel for what consonance a and dissonances you'll have access too, just like you subconsciously do with tonal scales. You know that 1^ and 7^ is a major 7th, you can easily picture the perfect 5th from 1^ to 5^. Do the same thing with your polytonal scale combination.

Once you start writing, first of all I'd suggest writing a dual melody instead of a melody + accompaniment. Write a motif, and find a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that compliments it, keeping in mind your consonant key points that you should have in mind.

I have a good little example for analysis doing exactly this if you'd like.
</p></li><li><p><b>proghouse</b> 2013-11-28 06:52:55 jasonmixed<br>I like the sound you're going for.  

* It needs a lot of EQ work.  You need to space things out more so it's more defined.  As in look at each line and give it its own space.  

* The lines are muddy so it feels kinda sluggish.  Lower around 200hz to give the kick more room to thump.  As well as clean up the sidechain.

* The <b><u>countermelody</u></b> chord line (1:15 is when it first comes in) sounds very out of control it needs to be tamed a bit. EQ it and give it a smaller release. Lower the decay on the reverb.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2013-11-30 13:04:06 -fd-<br>I think it's meant in the same way as people talk about modes in European folk music. There is polyphony and harmony in a general sense but it doesn't play the same role as it plays in western music. Consider even when someone looks up how to play a top 40 pop song. A common answer is to tell you the basic chord progression. But, some types of music just don't have this as a foundation because rhythm, melody, <b><u>countermelody</u></b> and other aspects perform that role instead.

So if say, a guitar was playing a certain part, then maybe I'd think of how it would sound with trumpets instead, or maybe some sort of new <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that would sound interesting contrasting with it. When I was a kid I would kind of "compose" a soundtrack to my life, so like if I was walking to lunch I'd have symphonic James Bond style music or whatever, but I don't do that really anymore. Now it's much more thinking of the same musical idea over and over again until I think it's all I can think about, at which point I can hum it into my iPhone to get it out, and then think of all the different things I could do to go from there. I guess a good analogy would be like trying to navigate without a map: you think of what might happen if you go left or right, but then once you actually head down the road you see it actually wasn't really like what you imagined and then you change what's in your head accordingly.

I don't actually like Kanye's music but a lot of the hype is that because he's pushing hip hop out of predetermined forms that's it has kind of fallen into and stayed in out of laziness. One specific example is how he structures his songs. Instead of the played out Verse/Chorus/Verse/Chorus/Bridge (maybe)/Chorus, Kanye does stuff that's *way* more complicated and intricate like the skeleton of his song Runaway:

I. Intro – 14 bars – 6 bars of a single note repeated, followed by the first appearance of the 8 bar piano theme that will appear over and over. 

II. Interlude 1 – 8 bars, starting at bar 15 – the piano theme with the beat and background instrumentation added. 

III. Pre-chorus 1 – 8 bars, starting at bar 23 – “And I always find… for us to have a toast.” 

IV. Chorus 1 – 8 bars, starting at bar 31 – “Let’s have a toast… run away fast as you can.” 

V. Verse 1 – 8 bars, starting at bar 39, by Kanye – “She found pictures in my email… at least you know that’s what I’m good at.” 

VI. Pre-chorus 2 – 8 bars, starting at bar 47 – “And I always find… for us to have a toast.” 

VII. Chorus 2 – 8 bars, starting at bar 55 – “Let’s have a toast… run away fast as you can.” 

VIII. Post Chorus – 8 bars, starting at bar 63 – “Run away from me baby… run away fast as you can.” 

IX. Post-Chorus Reprise – 8 bars, starting at bar 71 – “Run away from me baby…run away fast as you can.” 

X. Verse 2 – 16 bars, starting at bar 79, by Pusha T – “24/7, 365… I’m just young, rich and tasteless.” – Note that the string theme that appears in the background for the final 8 bars of Pusha T’s verse is repeated later on, in the 2nd interlude. 

XI. Verse 3 – 8 bars, starting at bar 95, by Kanye – “Never was much of a romantic… if one day you just up and leave.” 

XII. Pre-chorus 3 – 8 bars, starting at bar 103 – ““And I always find… for us to have a toast.” 

XIII. Chorus 3 – 8 bars, starting at bar 111 – “Let’s have a toast… run away fast as you can.” 

XIV. Interlude 2 – 8 bars, starting at bar 119, piano theme + string theme from the 2nd 8 bars of Pusha T’s verse 

XV. Solo Piano Theme Reprise – 8 bars, starting at bar 127 

XVI. Distorted, Auto-tuned Voice Solo riff on Chorus Melody – 64 bars, starting at bar 135 –Introduction of a repeating 8 bar string <b><u>countermelody</u></b> theme to the piano theme. (Total of 199 bars.) 

You don't see countermelodies in hip hop much.

There's not like a distinct technique to creating a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. What it really come down is listening and imitating the people who do it well (see major jazz pianist Wynton Kelly and Baroque 4-voice work, which is all counterpoint after a point). 

For the music you probably are looking to perform, there is a tradition that goes back to fieldsong and the call and response there. Check that out--it can't do anything but help you make better informed musical decisions when you do start executing fills.

Already covered and good advice:

- Inversions—know 'em, love 'em, play 'em (I'm hearing inversion exercises in my head right now, lol)
- <b><u>Countermelody</u></b>—learn the scales and use them to fill in between what you sing; it's not necessarily about arpeggios, like you need to practice your scales so that no matter what chord you're on, you know what notes you can use to fill in between the vocal lines

Other tips:

- Don't be afraid to add 9ths, 11ths, 13ths, etc. to your voicings—it adds depth
- Left-hand can be a bit tricky—if I'm by myself (no bass player) then I typically double up on the root, maybe add in the fifth and leave out the root in my right hand voicings
- My favorite way of voicing and adding depth is using [upper structures](http://www.sonic.net/~jazz4/us.html)—you can get some pretty cool sounding stuff from that; start off simple and use the root + fifth in left hand and explore the scale you're in. Like, Db lydian is super fun, so Db + Ab in left, and C + G in the right. Then you can start to think about adding things like b13 or b9 or whatever.

That is: a melodic instrument, a second line that moves *mostly* in parallel thirds or 6ths with the melody, and then your bass line. You can either do this with Vln. 1 &amp; 2 on melody, Vla on <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and continuo on bass line. Or put Vln 1 on melody, Vln 2 on <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and have the viola and continuo do the bass line (viola an octave above the cello, of course). Of course, there's more to orchestration than this, however, these two textures are the basic fallback options. 

For your material, I don't think it's best to think about melody and harmony as being entirely separate, but actually as a unit. Classical music is built up from these stock formulas of melodic/harmonic units (we call them schemata). For instance, a [Romanesca](http://storage.gmth.de/zgmth/images/11719) followed by a [Prinner](http://storage.gmth.de/zgmth/images/11720). Try playing the Romanesca in quarter notes followed by the Prinner in eighth notes (including the 5 bass note!), and you'll have a good opening gesture for a classical piece! You can learn about these schemata here: http://openmusictheory.com/schemataSummary.html (this is a summary chapter, other chapters from the textbook go into more detail).

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2016-01-19 03:36:07 miquelpedro<br>yes that is frequency masking. there's several ways to fix this and i'll mention a couple here for the sake of giving you something concrete.

the easiest thing to do is to decide which (to use your example...) the piano or guitar is more important. mixing isn't about making *everything* sound clear. it's about making sure that the listener pays attention to what's important. so, let's just say the guitar is more important. what do you do now? basically, make sure you can hear the guitar.

the first thing i'd try is simply turning the piano down in the mix. can i hear the guitar better but still "feel" the piano in the background? if so, the great! but maybe that doesn't work. 

next i'd try panning the piano. if i keep the guitar mono (because i want it front and center since it's the important element) does the piano work if i pan it hard left? what about hard right? if that works, then great! lol

if that doesn't work, then i'd pull out an EQ on the piano. i know from experience that the guitar's frequency range cuts through around 2 - 4k, so I'd cut pretty broadly into the piano in that range (probably like 3 - 10dB). if that doesn't quite work, then I'd boost a little in the guitar in the same range.

by this point, i should be getting pretty close. but if it's still not working, the next thing I would do is also put a low pass filter on the piano and start chopping off the high frequencies until I could definitely hear the guitar better.

if i still felt that the guitar was being masked, i might even put a large room reverb on the piano (at about 30%) to push the piano back into the mix (reverb makes things seem further away and therefore, the guitar would seem closer by contrast).

if that *still* doesn't work, i'd then heavily side chain compress the piano using the guitar as a trigger. this way whenever the guitar plays, the piano is ducked in volume.

at least one of the above will do the job. but i'd make all these moves listening at low levels, just to be sure that i really can hear the guitar properly. again, if i can hear it at low levels, then i'll hear it when i turn the mix back up.

finally, if none of the above works, then i know there's a problem with the production/writing. at that point, i'd rewrite the guitar and piano part to make them properly interact. since i chose the guitar as the important element, i'd probably make the piano part simpler or make it enhance the guitar part by giving the guitar a bed (simple chords) or a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> with the piano.

1. Only good intros I've ever heard are GFriend and INFINITE's. And they are GOOD.

2. See MV thread for my mini essay.

3. Generic album filler and safe. Have to fill up an album somehow. At least the girls get to push their vocals a bit. Getting some kind of a weird ethnic feel on that snippet of the chorus. Swear I've heard something similar in a J-pop song or something. Points for doing something very different from their usual style though.

4. Wouldn't be a girl group album without a saccharine pop song. Some fun rhythms; they go into half time on the rhythm and instrumental while the melody stays on the same tempo, kind of like what Dumb Dumb does. Build up to chorus is standard hi-hat riding &amp; bass line movement, but nice sounding nonetheless. I really like the synth strings and the synth electric guitars in the post-chorus. Think it's a good addition to the GFriend sound. Also a truck driver's key change!

5. Niiiice. This is what you want to see from an album track. Can't really promote this on a show, but it's delightfully well composed. Shout out to an awesome rhythm section and a good session guitarist. Delightfully funky. Really like the "You" part in the chorus.. Cool <b><u>countermelody</u></b> on the guitar in the outro.

I don't know exactly what the term for what you're describing would be. However, I do notice that 'Sons and Daughters' has a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, a second melody that is played/sung at the same time as the lead melody. Maybe that's the aspect you like about it. I'm going to list some songs that I think have a great build that leads to an engaging ending.

Another good example would be "She's Got Me High" by Mumm-Ra. Anyway, this is a great list - I really appreciate this. My favorites are "Vito's Ordination Song," which I can't stop playing, "Washed Up," and "God Only Knows."

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-02-02 05:35:15 xiipaoc<br>It's actually really easy.  The most important notes in the melody are in the chord, so you pick a chord that has them.  For example, if your melody goes D B G B D G, you *may* want to play a G major chord!  For relatively simple melodies, this is really obvious.  The other thing to keep in mind is the overall chord progression; if you know what makes sense -- you know, just the basic progressions, what usually goes where, etc. -- you can figure out which chord to play.  Finally, there's some degree of ambiguity as well; there may be many different possibilities, and if you can compose something interesting on the fly, which is *not* really easy, you can do cooler stuff.  For example, with the D B G B D G melody, instead of a G major chord throughout, you can play this <b><u>countermelody</u></b>: D B G G F# E.  For the last three notes, that would imply G major, D major or B minor, E minor.  How does this melody go on?  B A G B C# D.  The simple harmonization would be G major for B A G B, then A major for C#, and D major for D (that's a V - I in D).  You can get a bit more interesting: B7 for B A, then Em for G B, and then A7 for C# and D major for D, which goes to D7 then G in the next bit.  You see how this works?  You have to basically compose a harmonic progression under the melody, but any simple enough melody already gives you most of what you need -- that's why it's a simple melody!
</p></li><li><p><b>tolkienfans</b> 2016-02-03 14:12:04 Vexxt<br>my theory would be that when he sings the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to the evil of melkor, thats the invention of the hobbits. A simple people, a young race, with no great desires who couldnt be corrupted, as to purge evil from the land. So the frodo/sam/gollum deal is actually indirect but specific action from eru. 
</p></li><li><p><b>tolkienfans</b> 2016-02-04 06:45:35 Vexxt<br>I never thought that it included anything but elves and men, in fact its mostly explicit in that. 

When i say <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, i was referring to:
&gt;"In the midst of this strife, whereat the halls of Ilúvatar shook..., Ilúvatar arose a third time, and his face was terrible to behold. Then he raised up both his hands, and in one chord, deeper than the Abyss, higher than the Firmament, piercing as the light of the eye of Ilúvatar, the Music ceased.

&gt;Then Ilúvatar spoke, and he said: 'Mighty are the Ainur, and mightiest among them is Melkor; but that he may know, and all the Ainur, that I am Ilúvatar, those things that ye have sung, I will show them forth, that ye may see what ye have done. And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.'"

Which was a tiny addition to the Ainulindale, an uncorruptable afterthought. 
</p></li><li><p><b>anime</b> 2016-02-05 13:18:04 sladjkf<br>Hello, fellow alto/soprano saxophonist here, and I have some criticism to offer.

**1: Get a better mic.** Your mic quality is not good at all. You can pick up an excellent [Blue Snowball](https://www.google.com/search?q=blue+snowball&amp;rlz=1C1VFKB_enUS625US625&amp;oq=blue+sno&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i59l2j0l3j69i57.2061j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=blue+snowball&amp;tbm=shop) for a relatively cheap price (60-70 usd).

**2: Consider using different software.** I'm gonna assume you're using Audacity. Audacity is by no means bad, but I personally prefer using [Tracktion 4](https://www.tracktion.com/products/t4-daw). You can listen to yourself play in real time through your computer audio (this does however require that you set up [asio4all](http://www.asio4all.com)) and Tracktion has pretty good effects.

Speaking of effects...

**3: Use effects.** The main ones I'd recommend you use are equalizers, reverb, and compression. Equalizers adjust the bass and treble of a track, while reverb adds a concert-hall style echo. I really honestly don't have much of an idea what compression does, but I know it's pretty important...

**4: Spice up your arranging.** Don't just give the tenor and bari  whole notes, give 'em some moving basslines or arpeggios. Don't just have the soprano play the melody the whole time, toss it back and forth between all the saxes. You could even make a quintet or sextet or septette- for example, have 2 sopranos playing the melody, 2 altos alternating between <b><u>countermelody</u></b> and sustained notes, and bari and tenor covering the bassline.

**other things I noticed/want to comment on:**

You make a lot of licking sounds in the recording. Don't do that.

I'd personally recommend recording all parts in one take, as then you avoid having awkward jumps in volume and articulation.

If you can, try to do the split-screen video thing. It really does make your video look a lot more professional.

This isn't specifically related to your music, but... I feel like your username is really boilerplate. There's plenty of anime saxophonists out there on youtube, what makes you different? I don't mean for that to sound too harsh, but for example (this might be a bit of a weird analogy) people don't know well-known let's-players by "that let's play guy". They know them as Markiplier, PewDiePie, etc. Unique usernames really do contribute to your content.

Also, commenting "Please subscribe so you get updated and to support me" on this thread kinda gives me a bad impression- it kinda implies that all you care about is subscriptions. I think help if you add in comments with a little more personality- it kinda makes things feel more human, y'know?

Wow that's a wall of text.

Kudos, though- you can play sax better than I can.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2016-02-06 02:04:27 Zagorath<br>I'll be honest, I'm not very familiar with the bassoon's solo repertoire. Pretty much the only pieces I'm familiar with are the [Mozart Concerto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnqexXheK98) and the [Mozart Sonata for Bassoon and Cello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZFQcanE5uI). I love the concerto, but to be honest I'm not a huge fan of the concerto.

But I do love some of the orchestral moments the bassoon has. The opening to [Le Sacre du Printemps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UJOaGIhG7A) is just amazing, one of my top five openings to any piece, probably.

The opening to [Tchaikovsky's 6th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDqCIcsUtPI) is another great moment.

A slightly weird one, but I am absolutely in love with the bassoon's <b><u>countermelody</u></b> during the recapitulation of the 1st movement of [Beethoven's Symphony No. 5](https://youtu.be/7jh-E5m01wY?t=4m48s) (4:48). It's actually one of the things I look for when deciding how much I like the recording of that piece. EDIT: Another thing I like to listen for is whether the bassoon or horn is used at the start of the second theme in the recapitulation. I think I tend to prefer the bassoon at that moment.

Similarly, there's a really nice bassoon <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the [4th movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9](https://youtu.be/XeT17YeUj5k?t=3m9s).

Back with some more obvious ones, there are some great little solos in [Rimsky-Korsakov's Sheherezade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhV78zLt3KE) and [Stravinsky's Firebird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceIpM_bLSTA).

Much like the flute, I feel this is an instrument that honestly isn't that great in completely solo works like sonatas and concertos, but when it has briefer solos within a greater ensemble, like most of the above examples, it absolutely shines.
</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2016-02-08 11:47:40 DubiousBeak<br>She did a bit of melisma and "riffing" but she did not sing harmony or <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, so I am not sure what you are talking about there.
</p></li><li><p><b>Saxophonics</b> 2016-02-11 22:26:42 mcfluffertits<br>I personally would prefer tenor in this case. The tenor part is usually the connecting instrument between the higher horns and the bari. Sometimes the tenor will lock in with the bari on basslines, provide a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, or harmonize the melody. 

I really like playing harmony parts :P
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2016-02-15 13:56:21 ataleoftwotitties<br>empty moments is pretty damn catchy, nice sample work! gotta say i'm not too big a fan of the snare, doesn't quite seem to fit the vibe - it sounds a bit too generic(?) would try to play with lowpassing it/pitching it down a little and pushing for more of a lofi and less crisp feel, but that's just me. similar for the hats. in terms of adding stuff, maybe find some vocal samples to throw in there and break up the flow? probably room for some higher pitch synths for a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> too
</p></li><li><p><b>RateMyAudio</b> 2016-02-17 12:45:03 leap_music<br>Really professional sound on the intro, I love that tight high hat with the samples. Some of the drums sound a little excessive in the high end, but that's pretty subjective. I also feel like the half note organ-sounding pads are a little intense, they get a bit in the way of the great <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.

Personally, I'm not a super big fan of the brass synth patch, but again that's just subjective. I love the fat bass hits with the little bit of decay, it's really awesome how it doesn't get in the way of any of the other moving parts.

Minute 3:30, I love the sudden switch up!! Totally not expecting it but it's great. At 3:50 when you do the stereo separation, it feels a little jarring to have it suddenly so separated, but I also kind of like it?

Great piece tho!
</p></li><li><p><b>touhou</b> 2016-02-18 06:05:31 sladjkf<br>Well, let's see.

The intro is a bit lacking. In general, before the ZUNpets come in, there's not enough presence from the bell synth thing. Adding "articulations" on the ZUNpets (controlling their attack and release) will make it sound cleaner- holding the note until the next doesn't always work.

You're missing a lot of middle and bass, and the drums are a bit loud IMO. Filling up the bottom registers really makes your composition sound fuller.

Adding in more <b><u>countermelody</u></b> would help.

It's really kind of repetitive. Perhaps you could add in different melodic sections, chord progressions, and more instruments?

Also, musically unrelated, but "Bad Mood Youkai" sounds like such a weird title to me.

It's better than when I first started uploading my music here, though. How long have you been doing this for?
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2016-02-20 12:41:03 Flufflecorns<br>My composition is what makes me unique, which makes it a bit difficult to showcase. But I play heavily jazz/fusion-twinged metal; prog with its roots in 80's thrash, modern stuff like Mastodon, and hard bop and funk and modal jazz and whatnot. Jazz chords, groove, emphasis on melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, etc. I'll edit with links in a minute.

&gt; Tom Hasslan (guitars)
Axel Skalstad (drums)
Jørgen Mathisen (saxophone)

&gt; Review by Thom Jurek

&gt; Norway is home to a number of bands that explore the connections between free jazz and hard, progressive, and avant rock. Shining, Elephant9, Bushman's Revenge, and the Hedvig Mollestad Trio are four of the best examples, yet each has its own sonic approach to composition, rhythm, and improvisation. What's more, all record for Rune Grammofon. Krokofant is the name of the Norse power trio made up of guitarist Tom Hasslan, drummer Axel Skalstad, and saxophonist Jørgen Mathisen. As evidenced by their self-titled debut, their sound is deeply influenced by the forceful jazz-rock of John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra and the early-'70s albums of guitarist Ray Russell, the angular precision of Larks' Tongues through Red-era King Crimson, the vanguard rock explorations of Henry Cow, and the free jazz skronk of Last Exit. But Krokofant add another element too: an unabashed love for prog metal. On album opener "Polyfant," one can hear the physical, mathy attack of Meshuggah. Muscular guitar riffing gives way to a head-to-head guitar and sax duel, yet each player pays heed to the forceful shifts in time and dynamic introduced by Skalstad. The razored twists and turns in the intro to "Bodega" give way to a nearly funky approach as Hasslan's riffs and the double-timed drum attack allow for an extended, imaginative solo by Mathisen and a focused guitar break that weaves jazz chords, arpeggios, and finally six-string metallic histrionics amid a furious rhythmic syncopation. In "Thispair," Mathisen's tenor sax initially offers a dolorous yet lyric melody framed by Hasslan's slow contrapuntal accompaniment, illustrated and developed by Skalstad. The saxophonist and drummer move into free terrain rather quickly, pushing against the margins of the guitarist's consistent <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, creating nearly cinematic drama. The 13-minute closer, "Castaway," commences as an atmospheric jazz exercise with crystalline guitar, shimmering cymbal flecks, and wafting low-register tenor lines that reflect post-Coltrane modalism. It floats along, with some breezy turns and shapes, until hard surfaces are reintroduced and the piece gets freer, more focused on what lies inside the improvisational dialogue. It's a stirring finish. Krokofant's riveting debut offers an exciting aural portrait of a band that already plays like a much more experienced ensemble.

Anyhow, most songs can be done in a dixieland style just by adding polyphony (basically improvised <b><u>countermelody</u></b> above and below the main melody) and relevant instruments (tuba, banjo and clarinet)
</p></li><li><p><b>RateMyAudio</b> 2016-02-23 17:04:45 Invinciblade<br>That opening filter was really nice.  I'm digging these sounds too.  The sax sound was recorded?  Is that you playing?

Normally I find arpeggiated stuff like your <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to be too clunky.  It actually works really well for this piece though.  Maybe it's the chord progression in particular?

You did a good EQ job, keeping each instrument in it's own band as well.

I would maybe bring your kick out a bit.  Your piece has this cool club/jazz feel going for it, and the kick would help it drive even better.

Overall I really like this piece.  The genre is right up my alley.  Well done.

Deacon taught me to find that balance between holding down the rhythm and spelling out a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. He had an inate ability to walk that line like few others have.

Kaye is pretty self explanatory. She is the most recorded bassist in history. None of us would be playing the way we are without her. She completely changed the instrument and is responsible for so many of the great basslines in rock and pop history.

</p></li><li><p><b>WritingPrompts</b> 2016-02-28 08:28:15 CaseH1984<br>It had been weeks since Magic returned to the world. First it was subtle, then... then Musicians learned fast that their melody and song carried threads of power. They tried to rebel against their corporate masters, but as the old stories warn be wary of what oaths you make lest you find your selves in Contracts that bind.

These hateful men and their caged Songs swept the land. Traditional armies were not as ineffective against the elements as one may first think, but when song pulls at hearts and men turn from friend to fiend the Old Countries soon fell. 

Yet these would-be Masters were soon challenged. The Magic was not the only thing to return  to the land. Beasts of all nature and means roamed the land. Some offered wisdom. Some offered Mischief. Others offered only Death and Blood.

***

A stocky muscled teenager surveyed the broken remains of his neighborhood. His band stood together, but to a man they were all exausted. When the Youkai came next they would have no shield. The Metal would not die, but flesh? Flesh could not endure.

"Miri," A kid offered their singer a water bottle. "We've got everyone evaccuated to the park. Kamio told me to tell you the Coilition is holding and you should get moving before the Vocoloids show up."

Miri nodded once and patted the child's shoulder, "Go, we'l be there in a bit." Then she grabbed the child's arm briefly. "No heroics. This isn't like TV. They won't care that you're little. Hell, they'll want to grab you up first to recruit."

Fear lit the child's eyes before he started running. When he was out of earshot Miri started to bundle up her guitar. They were too tired to shlep amps and speakers, but she wasn't going to let Them get her guitar. "Alright you punks. You heard smallfry, We've got Vocoloids inbound."

Junpei managed to get his drum walked back onto a handcart. "The Electronica isn't letting us have much breathing room are they?" He wished the Pop-Alliance hadn't knifed them in the back, but that was the thing... they were Metal and they were so very far from the frozen wastelands of the Brutal Land and its burning gates.

Yet here. This island that had been Japan. It had been his family's home since forever and he would not abandon it. Miri had been cast out of the NOrthlans and had taken in with his band as their Voice. 

The baseline was felt before it could be heard. WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB.

They were out of time. Junpei looked around at his bandmates and saw that they could barely stand much less make Music.

WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB. 

Words were impossible as the screech of artifice shredded the air. He saw them. The Vocoloids all marched in unison. They were a desperate gambit that had drove the Youkai back, and so when the Nations formed the Electronica took hold the lands sundered by the Pop Wars. Ye tthey had been at peace. What changed?

Junpei listened as the beat started. Sound turning from raw overpressure, to music. He could feel it in the air ad earth and even in his blood. The Music called to him. Yet it was not His. His blood ran Metal no matter that his instrument was a traditional drum. He was the only one in his band that could have any make even a token resistance and the Vocoloids knew it. They never faultered or slowed asthey marched in lockstep.

THeir un-natural sound issued from their very bodies as they came at Junpei like a wave seeking to wash away a sandbar. He had no hope of opposing that unfaultering unceasing wall of bodies and sound

Instead he did the insane... and joined its rhythm... caught onto the rhythm and cadence of the beat and added his counter melody into it, weaving and twisting his drumbeat through so the very nature of the song itself changed. The artifice that promised Death and Fire twisted its meaning turning from his neighborhood and the fallen of his Band. The words, their fire, their death, their promise of Doom threaded through, channeled and harnessed by the giant drums he had libbed from the old Taiko club's storage when They came.

It was not the first time he had woven <b><u>countermelody</u></b> of centuries old Drum Song into his enemy's melody. Their song twisted, trying to integrate his melody and turn back to its purpose.

Junpei smiled as the song faultered. That was his opening. The point where his subordinate rythm could become the dominant beat. His arms burned with exaustion but his pace increased. He could not let up, would not, and so played on.

They wer eforced to choose between letting the song die and leave that ambient Magic for him to clame, or ride along and hope he would faulter. The Vocoloids, for all their simulated emotion and false humanity wer beings of logic and weighted calculations.

They played on, hoping to exaust the drummer in their way. Yet even as they played the tidal wave stopped, the sea stilled around the island of sand.

Junpei twisted the magic, took from it in ways that men did before itwas more than simply the primal call of Music to Men. 

Slowly he renewed Slowly his band struggled to their feet. 

Slowly they moved to position.

Then... then they moved with purpose. They moved to take over the beat and turn the Electronica from Primary to a small Backup to their defiant roar. Others joined in. A fusion of Pop and Metal, Synth and Jazz and Traditional in a wall of sound. 

The Vocoloids faultered. Then fell.

Long had Junpei known the value not just in the human heart, but in looking past the borders of Genre and Land. He was not alone in this Fusion, but he was just the Drummer. who ever thought the Drummer was ever important?

He would be forgotten in the singing of this battle. The Bards would note him, if at all, as just another beat that joined in as Miri rallied against the impossible.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-02-29 23:14:19 tcspears<br>I looked on Wikipedia for One Day More, and it is described as Quodlibet:

"It is composed in the key of A major and is set to the tempo of Moderato at 86 bpm. One Day More is a choral piece featuring many solos from the main characters of the stage show, all of whom sing in a counterpoint style known as dramatic quodlibet, featuring parts by the ensemble. The song borrows motifs and themes from several songs from the first act.

Each character sings his/her part to a different melody at the same time (counterpoint), before joining for the final chorus:

Valjean picks up the melody of "Who Am I?" without any changes (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
Marius, Cosette and Éponine sing to the melody of "I Dreamed a Dream" with Éponine's taking the bridge ("But the tigers come at night", sung by Éponine as "One more day all on my own") (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs, modulating to F# minor, G minor for high toned TVs)
Enjolras repeats the bridge melody of "I Dreamed a Dream" but in a major key, with Marius singing a minor <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. (C major, Db major for high toned TVs)
Javert sings to the already often-used theme from "Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven" or "Fantine's Arrest", only slower and in a major key. (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
The Thénardiers sing to a slightly changed melody from "Master of the House" (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
The revolutionaries repeat the bridge melody of "I Dreamed a Dream" in a major key with a counter melody that is only instrumental in Fantine's solo. (A major, Bb major for high toned TVs)
At the end of the song, everyone sings the melody of "Who Am I?" (C major)"

</p></li><li><p><b>MadokaMagica</b> 2016-03-04 10:50:55 sladjkf<br>Ook. I'm going to go ahead and be a bit critical here.

In your introduction, I have a bit of an issue with your choice of the vibraphone as your lead instrument- it's got too much conflicting resonance (sounds a little detuned). You also kind of covered up the piano, which is one of the main driving forces in the original song, and also what makes the original so interesting - how the bells and the piano are perfectly balanced and weave together to make a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. The flutes in the beginning also really need dynamics as they're also covering up some of the lead.

So I'm going to be a bit harsh here - I just absolutely hate the buzzy pad thing you chose as an accompaniment to the loud section. It cuts through way too much and detracts from the main melody while also being really annoying to listen to. In its place, I'd suggest using a double bass. 

The drumset also sounds really robotic and dry to me. Mix the patterns up a little more. It's also way too loud, IMO.

Adding in harmonies to the loud section (woodwinds over strings) will add color.

Did you consider using choirs? It would have been very thematically fitting.

The resolution was nice, though. I have no intention of discouraging you - please continue making these. Aside from these problems, I very much liked the <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. May I ask what your DAW is and what the libraries you are using are?
</p></li><li><p><b>streetlightmanifesto</b> 2016-03-14 22:18:50 -Osteoblaster-<br>Thank you very much! It means a lot coming from someone who puts out some quality arrangements himself.

Yeah, my original intent was to transcribe two songs per day, which I mostly stayed consistent with (even though I had ended up pulling an all-nighter to finish They Broke Him Down). Luckily, I had little else to do, so I was able to put a lot of effort into making the songs accurate. I'm no stranger to transcribing, but this was certainly a challenge. The middle voices are very hard to hear in some places, and sometimes it's even hard to differentiate between them, like when the trombone and tenor sax have some sort of <b><u>countermelody</u></b> going on.

Rehearsal marks and such are definitely things I'm planning to use more often. I was lazy about this from the beginning, but I do plan on changing that. I'm going to put a lot more effort into those things you mentioned and articulations/slurs. I might even revist THTT and add those (and maybe redo some other things as well).

Yeah, I had figured I'd stay away from Somewhere in the Between because I thought you were working on transcribing the whole thing. But I dunno. If you're not necessarily trying to do the whole album and want to like divvy up Keasbey and/or 99 Songs and each take a few songs from SitB, just hit me up whenever. Keep up the good work!

I've only been producing on fl for 9 months now but my stuff has gotten exponentially better once I found my work flow, and you'll find this eventually and know what I mean. Here's what I do

Simple 8 bar melody that establishes the feeling, probably something that would be playing throughout the track or will be the main theme. (Think With That- Young Thug) 

Then from there add in some chords, then a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. This is all done in the same pattern on the channel roll, nothing sent to the mixer yet. So with those 3 patterns working off of each other they're going to cut in and out throughout the beat. 

Then, I do the hi hats first, then snare, second snare (think the high pitched trap snare, and kick then 808. Or you can do the 808 before the kick. Then once you have drums to the 3 patterns you have, start making a second 8 bar pattern off of all of these for variation to keep the flow going and not be repetitive. 

Then to the mixer, then compose it after that/automation clips in the playlist. 

Hope this is an easy starting point for you
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2016-03-21 23:36:15 arktopolis<br>You have a great style, it really sounds like there is a vision behind this! The piano idea is just stunning. It sounds like a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that has taken the role of the main melody. Some things that bugged me:

The chord ending the theme, at for example 1:03... I keep wanting the bass note to be a full tone lower! At the moment it's very unfulfilling.

I think that the sound design is mostly fine, but some instruments are lacking in quality. Like the guitar(?) in the intro, sounds a bit fake if you know what I mean. It could use some variation in velocities. 

Another thing are the string sounds, like the one from 4:06 on. It sounds really thin and unconvincing.

Lots of the elements could use reverb also! Especially the guitar and hihats.
</p></li><li><p><b>touhou</b> 2016-03-25 02:55:37 FallbackMan<br>Yeah, the 5 parts thing is where a lot of songs fall short. I don't think Hartmann's Youkai Girl is actually quite dense enough for 5 parts but its chaotic nature means you could probably add in some extra parts to play without it clashing much.

Some suggestions of my own:

Green-Eyed Jealousy would sound really nice on strings. But the piano part might be a little fast paced and it can get a bit simple at times. No-one wants to be sitting there playing simple chords while one guy plays the melody.

Phantom Ensemble actually has enough parts for 5 people which surprised since, you know, I was expecting it to be a 3 person piece.  It's cheerful, though it might get a little repetitive.

Someone's already mentioned it, but Pure Furies has a rather busy <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. Probably wouldn't be too hard to arrange for five people by just switching around the different countermelodies and you could add in pieces of Sea Where One's Home Planet Reflects if you wanted.

For the complextro section, like..I really have no idea how to do that stuff or even if I remotely pulled it off but I guess it is what it is.. but it was essentially just a number of basic bass-synth patches in Serum that I would resample i.e record the sound to another track as audio and then process with distortion and flangers etc on that track and rerecord that to another audio track and so forth.. then just chop the recorded samples up (this is why I like working with audio more than MIDI), placing them amongst the drums and main lead, and then pitch them here there and everywhere adding some filtery stuff on top. It was really just a matter of getting 8 bars and duplicating it as the section was only 16 bars. I then changed a couple of little things pitch-wise in the second 8 bars but everything was the same in terms of rhythm. All those little samples were eventually compressed to hell in order to sit on top of the mix and not get lost among everything else.

After the complextro section, the main lead stops stuttering and opens up and on top of that I needed something a little more atmospheric to sit behind the main lead slightly but not going as far as a pad sound.. I still needed it to retain a sense of aggression. I used Serum with the Paradigm Shift preset slightly modified, then high-passed at around 400Hz to move it back in the mix but still leave some mid content. It ran through iZotope Trash to give it that aggression and then some sidechaining. [Here's what that track's processing looks like](http://i.imgur.com/VinTpap.png)

There were only really 2 more main synths in the track and both come at the halfway mark when the progression changes in the breakdown. The progressiv-y pluck synth that is introduced is a Serum patch I designed looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/iEusup5.png). It is basically Lfo1 as a saw wave running dotted eighths and modulating the filter cutoff with Lfo2 then also modulating the cutoff but not as much. Gives it a weirder rhythm than normal eighths etc which I though was cool. I also like the MacBeth and Cwejman wavetables as they're more analog sounding saws than the Init one and obviously some unison detune to add width..I tend to turn it down to maybe 60% in the Global area though depending on the mix.

The last main synth is the little topline which comes shortly after the introduction of the previous synth. This is kinda my way of 'telling a story' or setting up a mood which is predicated a lot on <b><u>countermelody</u></b> (not so much here though). I used Strobe2 as I like the internal reverb and delay (and it also has the cool analog function). Channel [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/9hCgEYC.png). Compression was to let all of the sound sit on top of the mix including the really long reverb setting up the atmosphere.

I won't go into too much detail as it's all really the same.. but most of the synths run into their own individual send/return tracks for effects meaning I have control over the original dry synth sound and the effects of that sound separately. They pretty much all do the same thing as it's either a delay or reverb &gt; EQ &gt; sidechaining and are just dialed to taste in terms of decay time or delay time. One thing I will add is that I actually have a return for the kick with just a really short reverb on it so as to add some high-endy overhead space to it. There are also a couple of pads and things like that but all I do is find a cool preset in NI Absynth or Camel Audio's Alchemy (yay I still have it) and EQ it to make it work usually with a bit of high passing.

**FX**

Not that much to say here just your usual reverse crashes into forward crashes and long as hell reverb/delays. I just added some stuff like phasers and flangers on the reverb tail to make it a little more interesting.


So yeah that's about it really. If I've missed anything really obvious (lol. probs have) let me know or if you have questions I'd be happy to try and provide a helpful answer!
</p></li><li><p><b>movies</b> 2016-03-30 20:52:38 LordSepulchrave<br>&gt; I think the answer for you is = "The Williams score is the right score for Superman", and feel free to correct me if i'm wrong. If you were cynical about it you could reduce Williams piece down to three constituent leitmotifs, too, like DAAA DA DA DA DAAAAAA DAAA DAAA DAAA ; p

The thing is, there's way more to Williams' themes than that. Trying to sum his theme down to a couple of bars of melody ignores all the harmony and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that goes into his work, the way that he uses the rhythm section interspersed throughout the melody, rather than as a simple block underneath it. The way he doesn't repeat melodies, but instead reprises them with changes in order to signify a new movement or act. The way he can go from loud to quiet in a heartbeat, as required for the scene. The way he doesn't make ostinato motifs the centrepiece of his themes, but instead layers melodies on top of repeating ostinato as a way to build a more intricate piece, one that is capable of conveying more emotion. Williams is a classically trained musician, and that means he knows how to get use intricate music as a way to generate specific emotional responses.

 I don't get that feeling from Zimmer's Superman work. He isn't a classically trained musician, he doesn't have an in-depth knowledge of music theory, and it means his emotional beats are much less subtle. When a big setpiece happens, its all drums and bass. When a quieter scene happens, it's slow piano with the same theme playing over the top. 

&gt;The rhythmic focus/simplicity is a part of that, and - IMO - should be seen as ... it's not a poor man's symphonic album, rather it sounds like an orchestra playing like a rock band! ; )

Ok, but the problem is when you already have a film thats as loud and chaotic as Man Of Steel, what benefit does treating the orchestra like a rock band bring? In my opinion it makes the film even louder and more chaotic, as even scenes that *should* and *could* have provided ample opportunity for quieter contrast become even more noise to add to the mix. The Flight scene didn't *have* to be a big loud noisy scene. It could have been a quieter, more introspective scene to provide contrast with the rest of the film. It could have focused, musically, on all of Superman's other qualities, in the same way Williams' flight scene did. But instead, the music makes it another action setpiece, in a film that already has too many action setpieces. 

&gt;In the case of the Flight scene, it's a visceral and explosive thing on film, and a light touch ala the Williams piece you linked, while wonderful in and of itself, wouldn't best represent what was going on in the scene ( IMO. )

And this is my point. Man Of Steel was already overloaded with visceral and explosive scenes. It didn't need any more added where they weren't already there. A more subdued but optimistic soundtrack could have provided the audience with a much needed breather moment, a scene that manages to elicit feelings of joy without needing to be loud and brash. 
</p></li><li><p><b>explainlikeimfive</b> 2016-04-02 09:57:18 RacistJudicata<br>I've seen a lot of explanations here but none really mentioning intonation, so I'll throw in my two cents as an orchestral and jazz musician of 15 years. Think of a pyramid. The lower the instrument, the more important it is to drive the sound. Here's very generic example. If EVERY instrument is playing one chord, and at the same dynamic (volume written in music, such as forte), the tuba and contrabass would be the bottom, and the piccolo would be the top. You must use your ability to listen to fit yourelf into the proper spot on your pyramid. Playing music is a constant science, and you must do your own job, remember your own role within the music (do I have the melody, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, etc) 
</p></li><li><p><b>popheads</b> 2016-04-06 10:26:00 raicicle<br>Lots of artists I'd mention, but thought I'd just bring up a few songs.

[Ladies' Code - Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgT1eq3CLM): My exception to the beyond k-pop rule, because they're really not on any of the big labels, and it really is just one of my favourite pop songs (and I think one of the best produced) pop songs of this quarter.

[Zhala - I'm in Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJLdCFGmYGI): Kind of a banger. She's Robyn's protegé, I believe. She's definitely part of the Scandi-pop boom (Sweden is literally omnipresent in the music industry, *everywhere*). The song feels quite unconventional in execution. It doesn't really have a traditional structure, but it's ludicrously catchy. Has a Kylie-style 'la, la, la' bridge', then the verses are repurposed into a coda (although still not a traditional chorus).

[Coeur de pirate - Adieu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7vYo6l06lo): She's relatively well known. She leans more to traditional old school songwriting, soft rock stylings, things like that.

[Yelle - Complèment fou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13o1i-cgTOA): The breakdown in the last third is kinda great. At that point, it's basically a Daft Punk song while everyone in the video just vogues.

[Kyary Pamyu Pamyu - Fashion Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GivkxpAVVC4): It's so ludicrously bonkers, and absurdly catchy, as with all her music. For me though, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu really does showcase some incredibly deep and interesting pop music. The chord progression is atypical and frenetic, the fact that it wavers between major and minor is weird in itself, the whole drone influence in the instrumentation, that kinda OTT modulation near the end, and also that the instrumentation in Kyary Pamyu Pamyu songs features a lot more <b><u>countermelody</u></b> than you'd see in Western pop these days. A lot of it comes from Yasutaka Nakata of course.

The weakest part I felt was the chorus, Aveys kinda apathetic vocals and lack of the strong <b><u>countermelody</u></b> felt the chorus to be a bit empty. But it still jammed hard


</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2016-04-18 11:46:24 The_Original_Gronkie<br>Any worthwhile music will never reveal all of its secrets on the first listening. The best stuff has to be heard again and again, and little melodies and hooks become apparent with each listening. The excitement as a listener comes when we know so many twists and turns, nooks and crannies, of a piece that we are constantly delighted by them as they pass us after dozens of listenings.

When I was a teen I was fairly obsessed with Beethoven's 9th Symphony. I listened to it over and over and many of my favorite parts were cool little countermelodies, especially in the third and fourth movements. Then I listened to a lecture that Leonard Bernstein gave and talked about discovering a small <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in one of the movements that he had never noticed until he was in his 40s. After hearing it once, he could never listen to the 9th again without hearing it and when he conducted it, he always made sure that <b><u>countermelody</u></b> sang out loud enough for the audience to hear. Here I was, a teenager, and that little tune was already one of my favorite moments, but Bernstein didn't hear it until his 40s. On the other hand, there were probably things he discovered as a kid that I still haven't found.

Unless you are a Bach or a Mozart, you will never hear everything on the first listening. All you can do is try to hang in there with the main tunes and then listen again and try to absorb more.
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2016-04-22 05:08:58 deadman001<br>That sidechained reverse crash is a bit too sidechained.
When the kick is playing solo there's a slight distortion maybe a too fast release on a comp?
The pluck synth is nice. Nothing more to say about that.
The bass is a bit too unison'd in my opinion.
In the breakdown the piano could use more reverb and a touch of delay and maybe let it play a little <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to your main melody.
Hihats are pretty piercing so maybe a 808-style closed hat could work better.
These white noise sweeps are also a bit piercing.
Overall it's a pretty good song!
</p></li><li><p><b>bangtan</b> 2016-04-22 08:14:19 arlenieeweenie<br>I liked it a lot! I did feel the bass chords in the intro into the first pre-chorus sounded a little off - maybe it was the bass line progression. The chorus is well balanced though and I was really impressed by the way it sounded! I think the bridge would sound better with having the violin sections play the melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> because the piccolo's harmony is a little overpowering IMO (it could be the fault of midi haha). I think I'd like to see a tutti of the upper voices or maybe strings (violin+viola+flute perhaps) at the very end of the bridge (the buildup to the high notes, can't quite decipher measure numbers but it starts the measure before the drums start doing the 32nd notes) since it's almost a climax there (and violins can play more! Can you tell I'm a strings person? haha). I like the inclusion of the glockenspiel though, good instrumentation. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the cowbell ending the entire arrangement (is that a cowbell or is it a midi thing haha), maybe a snare would be a little truer to original. Then again, it's your creative vision!

Thanks for sharing!
</p></li><li><p><b>bangtan</b> 2016-04-22 09:14:24 dentedwing<br>Thanks, I really appreciate your feedback! About the percussion, honestly I'm really not sure how to write for the drumset so I'm just trying to imitate the original. The cowbell does sound a bit strange throughout but I couldn't find the right 'sound'😅.

I'll definitely include more strings in future arrangements and watch out for the <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.
Thanks again for your feedback!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-04-25 00:21:14 xiipaoc<br>That makes no sense.  "A2" and "A3" can be chord names, probably meaning two-note chords -- A2 would be A B, A3 would be A C#, A4 would be A D, A5 would be A E, A6 would be A C# E F# because fuck patterns -- or perhaps A2 and A4 can mean sus2 and sus4, respectively -- but that's totally not what's going on here.

So my guess is that they needed names for the second and third chords and picked "A2" and "A3" for some reason.  If you use them, nobody will know what you're talking about.

What's going on here, musically, is there's a chromatic line going E F F# G over the A major chord.  The chord with the F and with the F# aren't really separate chords; they're still A major, but there's a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the guitar part.  If the music were written in normal notation, this would be really easy to write, but since only chord symbols are being used, they needed to get creative.
</p></li><li><p><b>fireemblem</b> 2016-04-25 12:08:01 cuddles_the_destroye<br>It sounds like a sound balance issue. At least I can easily hear the <b><u>countermelody</u></b>/rhythm. 
</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2016-04-27 14:21:11 Stereotypy<br>unless there's an unedited version or a director's cut out there, from what i've seen the video cuts out like two minutes from the bridge and from the end and even a little from the beginning iirc. to be fair a lot of it is, obviously, intro, outro, and bridge that can be cut without harming the intent or overall feel of the original, but still.

this was probably the first "tough" song I learned on the guitar growing up, basically teaching myself the entire metallica library up to that point (garage, inc-ish) by a combination of tabulature and by ear (tabs were sooo widely differing in quality depending on who attempted to tab it out which made learning it by ear a necessity, even on some of the semi-official cherry lane music brand tab books out there) and i could never get the intro clean/acoustic flourish-y part right (in between chorus and verses and between the intro and the first verse, etc). tabs never had it right. it took finding a random bootleg with a demo of "one" on it with minimal vocals and no added production nonsense for me to actually GET IT get it since their typical recording technique is to pan James slightly over to one side and Kirk to the other so you can pick apart both guitar parts much easier. still was a *little* off on a couple of elements but then about 4 or 5 years ago i saw a youtube vid of them performing it on a radio show and the cameraman did guitarists everywhere a solid by really focusing on the fretboard and fingerwork of both hetfield and hammett, enabling me to get it right, at least as far as how they play it live. good stuff. EDIT- PERFECT example of how NO ONE EVER gets it right when covering or transcribing that particular line i was describing- [the abysmal cover KoRn did for MTV Icons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oeVibY-ZeQ) didn't even BOTHER attempting it- pathetic. lol they didn't bother attempting the final solo either apparently because Munkey or Head or whoever the guitarist(s) are for KoRn can't fuckin' shred lol

EDIT 1.5- the radio show example was a [2003 Howard Stern Performance of "One"](https://youtu.be/2z0I8CblPgo?t=1m10s) which, since it's played live, in a sound room environment with no added production bells and whistles or crowds screaming, detuned a step if my ears serve me correctly, and is played a little slower- is very easy to pull apart as Hetfield's ESP explorer + setup sounds much fatter than Hammett's ESP KH-whatever custom + setup which is much brighter and you can physically see them both playing their individual lines and can see that a) it's not nearly as complicated as it sounds on [the studio version](https://youtu.be/sXPkmIwwobA?t=1m29s) and b) it's not nearly as impressive-sounding live either due to said lack of production bells and whistles, overdubbing, etc; for example on the live version Hammett plays a lower and then higher guitar lead line which in the studio version was dubbed over the top of each other to make it sound like a dual-guitar melody/<b><u>countermelody</u></b>, which to be picky and nerdy i'm surprised he didn't attempt to play both lines at once as you can sort of get away with emulating it by playing both melody and secondary melody together as a series of dyads instead of separate leads, but i digress.

EDIT 2- speaking of effortless shredding, after following random suggested videos after the MTV Icon covers I ended up on a ['97 performance of Pantera performing Cemetery Gates](https://youtu.be/oAqWXd0sXqo?t=4m35s)- initially i clicked it just to awe at how easily Dimebag Darrell is able to pull off those outrageously screaming pinch harmonics (the previous video was a Dream Theater cover of Cemetery Gates and he just couldn't get the pinch harmonics to wail like Dimebag did) but man watch how effortlessly he shreds through the solo. doesn't fuckin' miss a NOTE, each one sounding perfectly and without extra sound artifacts or other garbage coming through from sloppy finger and/or pickwork, and the physical action of his fingerings are so goddamned smooth. we lost a talent with that one.

the intro and middle solos are so much fun to play and they're not ridiculously difficult to learn and don't incorporate too much virtuosity so they're easy to learn, easy to play, and always sounds more impressive than they are.

i remember thinking "when i'm able to pick as fast as they do during the 'One' heavily distorted section, i'll know I'm competent at playing speed metal." boy was i wrong there, sheesh. i mean, plugging in the previous album "Master of Puppets" basically put me in my place on the first listen through. and James is notoriously known for downpicking many of those groove lines, which just seems goddamn inhuman. makes for a nice, uniform, percussive, striking "punch" though.
</p></li><li><p><b>mellophone</b> 2016-04-30 11:59:59 Mathemuse<br>It really depends.

Some marching bands march actual concert horns (very few).  If this is you, play loud, play proud, and try not to crack.

Marching horns are strange.  Same part in F, but pitched to a Bb.  You use Bb fingerings for every note.  Some say it is more difficult, but definitely easier than a concert horn on the field.  You use a horn mouthpiece, so biggest difference would be right handedness and marching.

Mellophones are like low trumpets with a horn bell.  Using a horn embouchure can be good for sound, but I'd use a non-horn mouthpiece (trumpet, cornet, or if possible, true mello) to get a better range.  (Lip placement either 50/50 or as horn, whatever is most comfortable with a good sound.  I've used both and they both work well in different places.)  Fingerings are "an octave down" because of a higher fundamental.  It's the same as a trumpet for fingerings, if that helps at all.  These are more preferred as a marching instrument, fitting well into the ensemble for both brassy and warm.  Right handed also.

Get ready for a bit of part doubling.  Horns/mellos tend to double around all over, especially with Hal Leonard.  Some things may be trickier than concert arrangements as the horn/mello is not the same as an alto sax (Hal Leonard), but all in all expect a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> role and harmony over melody.

Marching is more projecting, so try to get your tone centers solid so projection is easier.  Also, try out new mouthpieces if possible.  It can change a lot for a mello/horn.

Most freshmen come in not knowing how to play mello/horn at most schools, so just practice and you will be fine, no matter how hard it sounds.  You'll love it.  Trust me.
</p></li><li><p><b>homestuck</b> 2016-05-02 13:04:47 euniversecat<br>Nothing specific this time but I have a couple suggestions:

I think you should just remove the triangle part altogether. It sounds really awkward with your instrumentation.

The cymbal gets kinda repetitive and makes the parts with it sound the same. Maybe you could put the cymbal and bass drum on a drum set and switch between cymbals? Just a thought.

Don't bother with the key changes.

You should probably keep the first bit of F off of xylophone and marimba, just due to the style of the song. Maybe bass line on piano and bass, melody on piano, and high harmony on glockenspiel.

The chords at 1:14 are definitely off, as cookiefonster said, but I really like them this way.

H is the only section of the arrangement I don't like, ~~but I don't know the section well enough to have any suggestions~~. Maybe quieter xylophone and vibes? Also the cymbal is weird there. I think they're on beat 1 in the original. The melody also completely disappears there for some reason.

I should be a whole step higher. Also the chords there are wrong. Don't feel like figuring them out, but it sounds like the first note should be continued while the chords are played over it.

In the second and third to last measures, the melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> disappear, and I prefer the original to what you have. It just sounds kind of awkward leading up to the last chord.

The last chord should end on the third, and should probably only be played by one instrument.

One thing I've noticed in your arrangements is that you have a bit of trouble with chords. I would recommend the intervals and major/minor triads on this site: https://www.iwasdoingallright.com/tools/ear_training/online/

You could listen to it, try to copy it on your instrument, and see if you're right. It would help a lot, as most homestuck songs don't have particularly complex chords.

Anyway, great arrangement. I really like it, at least up to H. Keep it coming!
</p></li><li><p><b>Vaporwave</b> 2016-05-04 02:09:23 LeonStratos<br>This is a track I made soon after discovering Vaporwave. I took an SWV sample, stretched it, layered it and manipulated it with some effects and EQing. Traditional Vaporwave approach. Then I decided to reverse the sample and add some soft pad notes for texture. I added the dance style drums afterwards. 
https://soundcloud.com/leon-stratos/dimensions 

This is a completely original song I made. This beat was made during those 6-8 months before I discovered Vaporwave and was learning how to compose songs. I didn't learn how to mix until around the same time I discovered Vaporwave. So I took the original beat that wasn't mixed and didn't sound Vaporwave related at all, and I modified and mixed the sounds to give the track a dreamy Vaporwave feel. Since you've been producing for 10 years I'm sure there are some old tracks you made that could be manipulated and given a Vaporwave feel.
https://soundcloud.com/leon-stratos/indigo

This is an example of a short song I made with no original music and only the sample. This is sampled from an Erykah Badu song. I used the reverse technique again and manipulated it into a loop of a Vaporwave/futuristic inspired melody.
https://soundcloud.com/leon-stratos/moonside

So two examples of how Vaporwave sampling techniques inspired how I used the samples in those songs. And 1 completely original track made with a foundation that wasn't Vaporwave like at all and originally was a simple hip hop beat style. Mixed it and added effects to all those sounds and created the Vaporwave futuristic atmosphere months later. When I look for samples I don't think of how I can use this sample's sound and vibe in my song, but how can I manipulate it and change it. What could it be turned into. Its easy to sample 80s songs and a create a Vaporwave vibe but I enjoy   trying to create a Vaporwave vibe from non-traditional samples. I don't call my music Vaporwave because I don't really use a traditional vaporwave approach. I don't care too much to use samples from 80s songs because I didn't discover Vaporwave until the end of 2015 and I'm sure most of the good songs from that decade have already been sampled. I just say its Vaporwave inspired experimental music so I don't get attacked by the genre police. Wanting to use samples in my songs while giving them a unique sound I started experimenting with reverse sampling. I've been doing this a lot this year and a lot of the tracks on the three projects I've released so far contain reverse sampling. I find that putting the notes and chords of an already existing melody in reverse creates a new <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that wasn't meant to exist. This helps make the sample unrecognizable and turns it into something unique. I don't do this all the time because not every sample sounds good in reverse, but I have a habit of always testing it out every time I sample something. 

This is a track I made recently from taking a Jazz sample, adding some effects, pitch shifting it, reversing it, and manipulating it In a way that gives it a broken melody.

Sorry for the long response. Was just trying to explain where my head was at creatively when making these tracks and how Vaporwave influenced them even though they may not fit into a strict Vaporwave category. Just some stuff I've learned from experimentation and trial and error during the last few months.

The main difference in this one and the WIP I originally posted is that the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> and basslines are present in the entire song.
</p></li><li><p><b>radiohead</b> 2016-05-09 10:14:14 nshady<br>Yeah it's definitely a headphones thing.

In Rainbows is the vocal <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in Reckoner when Thom sings "because we separate like..." They sing "in rain... In rain... In rainbows".

They certainly put a lot more thought into subtle arrangements and <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, as opposed to developing songs with strong core melodies, or pushing grooves to the brink of chaos or destruction. This album is very much a beautiful tease. You've been pleased by these gorgeous sounds, yet leave partly dissatisfied because you were never given an opportunity to feel truly angry... or happy. And that leaves you with a sense of empty enjoyment? 

'I'm not living, I'm just killing time.' -- killing time REALLY well, though.

Some of the sounds you chose personally sound to me like they're like "knockoff trap" sounds. The main one isn't as bad but the choir and that other synth that has the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> seem eh to me. I like the actual pattern of the drums but like the main kick you used could be stronger. 

Also personally I would pick a clearer melody/scale. You have kind of an atonal thing going on here which isn't necessarily bad but it's a little ambitious for your first trap beat. Maybe stick to just a minor scale?

Those were my main critiques, hope they were helpful in some way.
</p></li><li><p><b>Music</b> 2016-05-15 17:13:37 IntransigentAsh<br>Ah right, that makes sense!

First movement in the vivace section the horns burst in gloriously with the melody - and because of the key they're written in, it's high, very bright and heroic.

Second movement in the assai meno presto sections the horns have the melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> again, bringing a richness to the texture.

Final movement the motif b26-9 (and where it appears later after K) is again up high in the reigster so it's bright and zings over the top of the ensemble.

Not as interesting to play as the Eroica parts (3rd movement horn trio ftw!!) but still some good stuff in there.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2016-05-17 06:25:12 xiipaoc<br>Step 1: noodle around with ideas.  In my head, or on the keyboard, or something like that.

Step 2: keep noodling around with those ideas until one of them is ready to be developed and you *have* to write the piece using it.

Step 3: write the piece and develop the idea.

That idea should presumably have both melodic and harmonic components as befits the piece.  The development should presumably also have both melodic and harmonic components as befits the piece.  You should imagine the piece's sound as a whole at any given point, unless of course you're writing a variation on an existing theme.  In that case, you may want to keep the theme as is but reharmonize it, or keep the harmony and write some <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.

That's just my procedure.  Of course, you can do it however you want.  I think having something to start with is an enormous boost in developing ideas, and finding that thing is one of the hardest parts of composition.  If you're constantly thinking of ideas, maybe one will come to you.  Maybe not.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2016-05-17 09:52:26 HeviHappy<br>I will make a basic patch with a square or synth wave. Then loop 4 bars and pick a root note I like. 

Then I press play with metronome on and make a rhythm with midi only using the root note. 

Once I find the rhythm I like I move the notes individually around the scale to make a baseline or melody. 

Following this I build the other elements around it; chords, melody, bassline, pad, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. Again, all using simple sounds. 

Once I am fairly happy with it I will replace the sounds with patches that fit, tweaking them to work with the midi and what I imagined each would sound like up until now. 

After this comes the layering and partial mixing of everything. Of course leaving room for drums. 

After this point I usually go on a roll and begin the hectic production process until the track is finished.

</p></li><li><p><b>m83</b> 2016-05-25 06:38:28 Iopia<br>I don't think that's really fair to say, as with you, I love both. I genuinely believe that Junk has some of Anthony's best songwriting yet (especially Solitude &lt;3), it's just very very different to his previous output. Definitely excited to hear what he's going to put out next.

EDIT (because I feel like writing more): Junk is a really good album. I understand why people don't like it, but after being warned time and time again about how much "cheese" there would be on the album, there's surprisingly little on there. Maybe I'm just immune to it (or maybe I just really like saxes) but aside from Moon Crystal, there's only bits and pieces occasionally thrown into each song. For me, the album shines in its softer moments. For the Kids is heartwrenchingly beautiful, and Susanne Sundfør knocks it out of the park with possibly the most emotional lyrics to feature on an M83 record yet. Solitude is classic M83, just with strings instead of synths, certainly my favourite track on the album and a contender for my favourite M83 song of all time. The last five songs are a highlight. Tension and Ludivine are two great interludes to add to the collection, and Atlantique Sud makes me smile every time I hear it. Time Wind is a really solid song, even if it's more Beck with Synths than M83, and Sunday Night 1987 is a beautiful way to end the album, even if it strays from the M83 formula of ending dramatically.

Again, I understand why people don't like it, but that doesn't mean it's not really good. It's poppy, even cheesy at times (although I feel it's less cheesy than it was made out to be), but it's M83 at its rawest. I think it's abundantly clear that this was the record that Anthony needed to make after HUWD. As he said in countless interviews, it's his most personal record, and that shines through in the music. Like all good records, you need to give it at least five or six records before you judge it, I'm still hearing new things almost every time I listen: a little <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in woodwind here, or a little synth bit there. While there are certainly parts I don't like (I'm *really* dissapointed with Mai Lan's parts on Bibi the Dog and Laser Gun), there's so much beneath the surface, hidden in plain sight in simple pop songs. Anthony explores so much across the fifteen tracks, and while I don't enjoy the album nearly as much as I did HUWD, I have mad respect for the man for putting this out there. I certainly don't think it's fair to the guy or his music to give it one or two listens and decide that you don't like it, never giving it another chance.

He sings of ports and of islands, of pirates and storms, and of the beauty of the world he has now*
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2016-05-30 12:15:40 AsSeenOnPurpose<br>I think the drums don't really fit that well in the song, they're too busy. It'd be cool if there was a bit less going on in the drum patterns so that there was a bit more space for a groove to exist. The snare fill is also kinda messy.
 
There are too many elements going on in the chorus and they're all kind of in the background. It'd be cool to hear one definitive <b><u>countermelody</u></b> against the vocal there in the chorus, maybe played on the flute instrument.

I think the mix is a combination of being too bright and lacking in low end. The bass tends to disappear at some points, could be a sign that the key needs to be lower so that the sub part of the bass is present across all notes.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-06-02 08:26:15 phalp<br>IMO:

* The rhythmic interaction between the bass other voices is key. 
* Make the bass melodically strong or it's wasted.
* But it's good to disregard both of these things temporarily in intros and stuff.
* Because rhythm is so key, it's usually helpful if at least one voice plays short, rhythmic notes, and it's always in your interest to consider the rhythm made by where notes *end*.
* You've actually got more resources than you need, not fewer. A single bass voice and higher melody is plenty for great music. 90% of the time noise channel and the other melodic voice could be used only for decoration.
* Techniques like simulated echo and tracker arpeggios are a great way to make a tune pop after you've got it working on a basic level. Likewise volume automation.

It really boils down to laying down a good melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> (in whichever order you like), then using your knowledge of synthesis tricks to make the track more expressive.

</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2016-06-07 00:10:01 ZoeBlade<br>That's pretty interesting.  I'd say this already has quite a lot of character, so if you think it doesn't, it makes me wonder just how unique your music could get!

I like the eclectic choice of sounds... we've got, what, bright sawtooth melodies, slow dubstep style drums, acoustic percussion samples, a piano, and a few other assorted bits too.

I also like the arrangement, you've got a good ear for for when to add a new part and when to switch to another section.  Adding a rising sound just before a new section is always a good way of anticipating it too, very Xenomania.  Nicely done.

Your main melody starts at 1:07 as far as I can tell.  In my opinion, it's taking too long to get to a hook.  Your best bet is to add a second melodic hook, played on a different patch, and feature that before the main one.  Then you can even play them off each other, have that instrument play a short <b><u>countermelody</u></b> filling in the bits between the main melody at 1:14 - 1:15 etc (like, literally three notes would be sufficient to do this).

The piano at 1:57 might fulfil this role nicely, just adding it to the very beginning and as a sparse <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to the main melody, or a new part entirely could do it.

That's more for catchiness and interest, though.  As far as *character* goes, you already have it in spades.

And that breakdown with the extreme filtering before it all comes back... and that extreme gating...  and then the stuttering...  I really like all this.  Putting in lots of effort for things that only happen once is, I think, a big secret for making really good music.  All these little flourishes really add up.  It's one of the reasons I like BT's music so much, and yours seems to be headed in that direction, in a very good way.  You just need to take it a bit further.

You're definitely headed in a good, original direction, developing your own unique style.  Remember to keep it catchy throughout, keep pushing yourself further, and keep at it!
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2016-06-07 07:18:46 Bakkster<br>Really, that's the answer for *every* instrument. You ask yourself (and the band decides) what each instrument needs to be doing to make the group as a whole sound the best it can. Sometimes that means laying back, sometimes it means taking the lead, but it should always be in pursuit of the band as a whole rather than yourself.

I've played with drummers who just want to play triplet fills every other measure, I've played with guitarists who do nothing but noodle, and I've known bassists who just want to play <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. About the only instrument I've not directly witnessed being a note hog is a keys player (but I'm sure they exist). I think a lot of it is thinking that flexing your chops is the shortcut to music that sounds good, but when you're in a well functioning group who isn't overplaying you'll find that not only does your music sound better it's a lot more fun to play.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-06-17 07:13:15 ActualNameIsLana<br>I love Fiona Apple.  Her music often takes its cues from jazz progressions that are uncommon in most modern pop.  

#Regret 

The first four chords are 

    Cmaj - Fmaj - Gaug - Cmaj

Or

    I - IV - V+ - I

The melody leads the way into this unusual progression including an augmented chord.  The melodic line is

    E - F - D# - E

Here, the "dark" sound is coming from the augmented chord, which is a chord made up of two major third intervals, and the unusual chromatic motion of the melody.

#Valentine

The first two chords are

    Gmaj - Emaj+6

Or

    I - vi(add6)

This time the "dark" sound is coming from a simple minor chord with an added major seventh scale degree on top.  The movement in the left hand fools your ear a bit though, since the bass note is E and the piano chord on top is made up of the notes G B C#, which is enharmonically a Gdim chord.  Still not the same method as the one in Regret, not also a chord not often heard in modern pop music.   This is again accomplished through unusual chromatic movement in the melody.  The melodic line is moving in this case from D-natural down chromatically to C-sharp.

Chromatic movement in the melodic line above unusual diminished or augmented chords appears to be the key to the sound you enjoy in her music.  

Check out the way the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> line moves down chromatically in "Limp" for a similar, typically Fiona Apple sound.

* [1:43](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=1m43s) Theme 2 (*Gesangsthema*), A-flat
* [4:07](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=4m7s) Theme 3, E-flat minor, string accompaniment implying heavy contrapuntal potential.
* [5:46](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=5m46s) Theme 1 in B-flat, with main theme of the first movement in Horns I-IV
* [7:08](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=7m8s) Main theme of the third movement in the horns over the contrapuntal string accompaniment
* [7:36](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=7m36s) Third theme of this movement, with solo Horn playing a minor version of the Scherzo theme.
* [8:03](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=8m3s) Exposition closes with the first theme in the flutes, with Clarinet playing an arpeggiated <b><u>countermelody</u></b> implying the third movement's climax.

* [8:30](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=8m30s) Development begins with the third theme being passed from strings, to woodwinds, to Brass, etc.
* [9:35](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=9m35s) Theme 3 in inversion with new <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in Clarinet
* [10:04](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=10m4s) Theme 1 in Brass against contrapuntal accompaniment in Woodwinds.
* [11:23](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=11m23s) Theme 1 reharmonised against a triplet figure in the Clarinets
* [12:02](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=12m2s) Fugato section on theme 1. Note how, the more it is played, the more theme 1 starts to sound like the opening theme of the Adagio, especially in this version when taken by the Horns.
* [12:36](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=12m36s) Theme 1 now in counterpoint with the accompaniment to theme 3.
* [13:49](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=13m49s) Dominant pedal on D

* [14:01](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=14m1s) Recapitulation, now travelling via the same route from D, but not reaching C until...
* [15:05](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=15m5s) Arrival at C, followed by further development (This, and the opening movement of the 9th Symphony, are perfect examples of how Bruckner's recapitulations are essentially another development section).
* [15:35](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=15m35s) Amidst this new development, the Trumpet plays the Scherzo theme transformed into the Rhythm of the 1st Theme.
* [17:03](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=17m3s) Theme 2 in A-flat
* [19:01](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=19m1s) Theme 3 is recapitulated only with the accompaniment, fugally, in C minor but over a constant dominant pedal in Timpani and Contrabassi.
* [20:06](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=20m6s) The first theme of the first movement, in Trumpets, Trombones and Tuba, is heard in the key of C Minor for the first time in the whole Symphony, but the pedal does not drop, the Basses and Timpani still enforcing that C Pedal. This is not to be the end just yet.
* [20:29](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=20m29s) ...and the fugue continues, winding gently down, with still that dominant pedal insistently refusing to drop to I.

* [21:24](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=21m24s) Finally the bass drops, and a chorale on the first theme begins.
* [22:43](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=22m43s) At a tutti explosion of sound, the Horns suddenly burst through with the Scherzo theme.
* [23:21](https://youtu.be/vSMC26fx8zc?t=23m21s) The "Coda of the Coda" now features all 4 primary themes at once. The most obvious is the 1st Movement's primary theme, in low Horns, Trombones and Contrabassi. The Scherzo theme is also prominent in Flutes, Clarinets 2 and 3, and 1st Trumpet. The theme of the third movement is hard to make out unless you really listen for it, but its there in the high Horns, whilst the fourth movement theme is in Oboes, Clarinet 1, Wagner Tubas and Trumpets 2 and 3.

It starts off discordant and folky, then all of a sudden it could almost be a Black Sabbath track, and theeeen there's a fully a cappella bridge that's full of complex harmony, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, syncopation, and then, when it comes back in to the rockin section........

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-06-25 00:27:45 Phrygiaddicted<br>&gt; There are songs that go from, for example, IV to V. In CMaj, just back and forth between FMaj and GMaj with the melody clearly in CMaj.

Seems pretty indicative of mode to me, not always though, of course.

But a major *melody* is not on it's own indicative of the key neccesarily: you can write a major melody at the 10th harmonised over "vi" in an otherwise minor harmony, you can do the same over IV at the 12th. Ionian melodies at the 10th over an aeolian harmony is pretty common. A melody starting and ending on C, can be harmonised to start and end on I, vi or IV, no problem. This gets more restrictive the more individual melodies you have, for example a melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> starting and ending on A and C respectively could be harmonised as vi or IV...

By the way, V-IV, and iii-IV are pretty *lydian* movements.

Maybe i should have phrased that slightly differently: "if you have a progression in C major, that never uses the I chord, then it is *probably* not *particularily helpful to view it as* C major.

Nice work by him so far. No phasing to my ear, nice and clear with a full stereo soundstage. Phil is light right now but it's set 1

Adding thoughts as I have em. More edits forthcoming:

Don't Ease makes as fun a set opener as it makes a lame closer, so that's nice. BIODTL a sloppy hoot as it should be. Jack in the 3 spot is nice; a good version with bouncy tempo and a nice second solo. Guitar sounds good in this mix.

Rooster. Whatever, Bobby. I'm skipping to the Brent solo &amp; then over Bobby's predictably horrible slide felony to Jerry because otherwise this song annoys the fuck out of me. B3 sounds killer in this mix, nice and wet, hopefully we get to hear it on a real song. Pretty basic Jerry solo without the real fiery shred the song sometimes gets, and Bobby just sliding around underneath. Shitty song, standard crap version.

Cold Rain...nice. I don't even really love this song but I def believe it always meant Garcia was in a good mood &amp; it did light up the crowd. Will it have the big ending that makes it really fun? Would be nice to have more Phil if so...yep, nice ending with little runs

I always like Mama Tried, but I have nothing to say about Bobby's underage creeper polka

Very good Althea - really nice - but not one of the ones like from March where Jerry goes ape at the end

In fact he goes a little wiggier on LLR. There's a nice bit of Django-esque trilling early in his ending solo that's not typical at all, before he starts the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> theme. Very very nice version though the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> part doesn't go huge. I love the metallic-edged tones he got in LLRs of this era and the recording captures it.

Really fun Bertha in the "test me test me" arrangement with the hits dropping on different beats. Unfortunately they don't *really* nail the movement on the Test Me verse but it's still great.

Greatest Story as set closer. Baller as fuck move honestly. Phil a little more present now. Garcia actually remembers his part. Just a basic run through the changes (is there an even slightly jammed version of this song post Fall '79?!?!?) but I like it.

Good/above average set 1 without any real big highlights for me. I enjoyed it though.

Starting set 2, Phil sounds much more prominent now. 

Nice strutting China Cat. This is an era where Jerry seemed pretty interested in playing elaborate solos in the transition here and this one is cool, with lots of the stairstepping zigzag movements that build tension by making it sound like the change is always about to happen. Bob flirts with some slide in there, LOL. Real fleet leads briefly and then into a cool repeating figure to trigger the "checkpoint" (around 6:40) in the jam. Riders of this era are neat, to me they're all about Garcia playing (hopefully) intricate runs over the changes in the jams as the band peaks under him, such that his solo line converges with the rest of the band at the end of each run...first solo pretty good, nice energy in the Headlight verse...here we go...fuck, yeah. Pretty great. I like it when he really shreds those last few bars but that was hot.

Drummers make their vote known immediately LOL. Rolling drum intro with unison entry by the rest of the band is where it's at. Has the fast hummingbird leads I prefer in the first solo over the slide/bend approach of the second. Maybe he's just making Bobby feel better about his "contribution"? I think Samson is better just a touch slower than this so it has a little more pulse to it, this one has a really breathless feel...a nice blast of energy though.

To Lay Me Down. If you read some show reviews you'll see that one tour family was mourning the loss of a sister at this show. Lends the whole proceeding from here on out a bit of weight. This song becomes the emotional centerpiece of any show it's in, at least in these post-1980 versions &amp; even more so in set 2 placements. This one has one of those triumphant endings that elevates it to another level. Superb, sublime.

Fiery start to Playin'. Everyone but the drums are on point for the changes at the bridge, just something I like to listen for. Prototypical free flying hummingbird leads from Garcia. He's pretty much just doing whatever comes to mind and hoping the band stays with him. Downshift by 9:30, really a pretty short first lead segment &amp; not that atypical for this time...very nice but kinda underwhelming to me.

drums sounds like it's headed for NFA so Nobody's Fault, what a trip! Sung versions are a true rarity. Real weird version, sparse and lurching, but in an intentional way. I bet this was cool as fuck in person. It doesn't sound "right" but it's right. If you look for unique moments this def counts!

Lost Sailor...ok now we know the drummers don't like this tune, which is funny cause the drum parts are critical to the waves-slapping-on-the-hull ebb and flow of it and a lot of the time it's real nice...I liked this one, but then I usually like it. Saint peaks hard and well with nice Jerry leads and the band all thundering together like they should. Good versions but these post-drums placements always seem off to me.

EDIT: picking up the end of the show

Black Peter...this is certainly a great song, one of the heavyweights even when overplayed. This isn't an exceptional version on tape, but it's good, and the recording captures the searing tone in the guitar outro I always love. A good BP is a pleasure without needing to be the Best Evar. Kind of an abrupt ending lol

Sugar Mags is a tune that's very rarely standout on tape but was usually a hoot live. The exceptional versions have the big staggered hits with Phil bombs, Jerry shred and Weir chords all crossing each other up. This one verges into that territory a few times with most of the effort coming from Phil but doesn't really explode. Fun, cleanly energetic version.

Brokedown - the best "standard" encore obv. Love the B3 on this tune, gives it that churchy vibe...check out Nassau '80, sadly left off the official release...like Black Peter, a "standard" version will usually do it nicely for me...a beautifully phrased but standard solo drives that point home

~~~~~~~~~~

My overall take is that this would've been a great show to attend but lacks anything truly outstanding on playback. The first set is fine, but the best played tune is probably the LLR, maybe Bertha. Predrums set 2 is fiery and has that TLMD highlight, but I think the Playin' is wildly overrated based on a few minutes of fast Garcia leads in a standard mode for the song - it's good, though. The thing is, live, the combination of To Lay Me Down, Nobody's Fault, Black Peter and Brokedown would lend this set a lot of immersive emotional weight that's hard to appreciate through the distance of time.

Live in person I would have loved this set 2. Listening in 2016 it's nothing to write home about IMO, but at the same time, as an official Picky Deadhead I never found myself bored or annoyed aside from a couple of set 1 Bobby things I never like. 

I enjoyed the listen but probably won't spin it again.

I think Ed does something similar on Idioteque. There are several videos where you can see him in the beginning of the song playing something on the guitar without producing a sound. And in the final part he is playing that prerecorded thing, distorted and with all these weird effects going on.

There's also Noisestorm's signature sound (think of the lead synth from Leaving Now and Heist) as a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. The song sounds really pleasant in a weird way.

However the composer didn't take advantage of the wonderful diversity of the piano, and so always had the piano playing the melody and other instruments playing the bass line. This doesn't work very well, because only playing om the treble clef on the piano sounds very flat. Bringing in the bass clef, as a bass line, a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, or a series of complementary chords makes the piano sound rich and full. The other instruments can provide accompaniment and at times be featured (so the piano isn't always playing the melody).

With this framework, and depending on how it is being used, you could refer to this as <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, dueling, and/or trading bars.

Probably my favorite type is where it will start out as trading bars, the other voice thoroughly muting during the off turn. Then gradually one voice cuts in earlier, as does the other, and again and again becoming more and more frantic until they're both essentially doing simultaneous, different solos. It's especially nice when that leads immediately and flawlessly back into a badass refrain.

You can see similar things in other types of music, like classical, early 1900s style New Orleans jazz, and bebop. Dizzie Gillespie and Charlie Parker particularly come to mind.

In addition to the obvious stuff, I really like his orchestration and harmony. My favourite examples to point to are the bassoon <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the recapitulation of the A theme in the 1st movement of his 5th symphony, and the oboe's long notes that it plays just *after* its little solo. Beautiful subtle moments that Beethoven is just so great at doing.

More or less. There's infinite variation on it, but that's the basic framework.

&gt;would you say that quartets usually don't have chords in the traditional sense?

In the sense that there's not big fat block chords, no chords. But they are readily apparent, they're just played as some kind of pattern, more often than not.


&gt;Also, is the Viola generally playing in unison with Violin II, or are they playing different countermelodies?

Often parallel motion, rarely unison.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-07-26 18:02:32 xiipaoc<br>&gt; it seems like you would either do four voice counterpoint or have the first violin play the melody and the rest act as harmonic accompanyment

But that would be *boring*!  Why would they do that?  I mean, yes, Mozart was boring as all hell, but not *that* boring.  Remember the Classical period was a (fairly) long time ago, but people weren't actually stupid back then.  (Well, maybe some were, but whatever.)  There's no reason to be so limited.

The best way to think about a quartet, in my opinion, is as a large ensemble, not a small one.  You can write basically orchestral music, so long as it fits in those four voices.  The four players don't have assigned roles, like the basso continuo did in the Baroque period; there's no reason to do that.  You can easily fit a melody, a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and accompaniment into those four voices, and if you look, that's pretty much what they did.  They didn't do full four-voice counterpoint because that was not a texture they were particularly interested in developing, but they did plenty of two-voice counterpoint with accompaniment, for example.  And you can do even more.  You can take the essence of imitative counterpoint -- different voices playing the same thing -- and take out the actual counterpoint.  Just state a theme in the second violin, restate it in the viola while the second violin goes back to playing eighth notes or something, then restate it in the first violin, and finally in the cello.  Or you could have some other scheme.  In that era, composers were quite fond of actually giving the first violin all the good parts.  I try to never do something that crazy when I write music; I write for a cappella, and if I have SATB with no solo, that melody gets fucking *shared*.  Not yours, sopranos!  DEFINITELY not yours, first violins!  On the other hand, I sing tenor, so... by "shared" I mean "the tenors have it most of the time".  I didn't say I share *equitably*!

You may think of the Classical period as rigid and unimaginative, but it really wasn't so rigid.  (Ba dum tsh.  MOZART BURRRRN!)  I recommend looking at some scores and doing a motivic analysis.  At each point, figure out what each instrument is playing.  Is it just background 8th notes, the harmonic accompaniment you mentioned?  Is it a melody or counter melody?  How does that get passed from part to part?  What the fuck is that weird symbol on the viola staff, and why do the notes not make any sense?  (I still haven't figured that last one out.)
</p></li><li><p><b>singing</b> 2016-07-27 03:44:43 keakealani<br>It would be helpful to know what your background is and what you've already tried. Also, what style and harmonic language you're talking about. 

The tips so far are good, but a little generic. Ultimately, each style has its own harmonic language and harmony traditions, so you need to study the specifics of your style to get outside of very basic harmonizing. 

That said, here are some other ways to think about it. 

One is to sing the harmony as a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, rather than as "the harmony part". In function, not much changes. But when you start thinking about harmony as just another melody, you enable yourself to use more complex melodic structures and in turn, create fuller, more interesting harmony. 

Even if you're not a classical musician, I really recommend learning the basics of species counterpoint. The basic gist is following certain voice leading rules in order to develop the most singable <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, which applies to nearly every genre. You just might need to fudge with the exact definition of consonance and dissonance. :)

Another outlook is to think about each melodic pitch in terms of its resultant triads, and then tetrads and other extended chords. This is more analytical so it's difficult to do on the fly, but essentially, every note has three diatonic triads for which it is a chord tone. If you add the 7th, you get four, and so forth. If you sing any chord tone in one of those other chords, you can essentially imply the harmony, and from there, you should be able to narrow the harmonies down by function. 

Finally, don't be afraid to ornament. As one jazz improv friend once told me, there are no wrong notes, just notes you have to resolve. Even if you sing something that "clashes", you can almost always turn it into a suspension or run or turn. Be willing to use those ornaments to add color rather than letting them stick out. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2016-08-03 07:20:22 qwertyzxcvbnm<br>The piece is an excellent start, especially considering how you say this is your first real piece. I enjoy your mature use of chromaticism and modulation. It is evident you have a strong fundamental understanding of harmony and composition. 

I have a few criticisms that I feel you should address in your next work. 

* The chord voicings are unbalanced.

You put a lot of weight in the left hand and this creates muddiness. Look at measures 20-28. You voice your left hand to alternate between two very dense intervals in the lower register: a third and a fourth. Having dense intervals in the lower register should be avoided because it makes the sound very dry and thick. Listen to the dead space that is created in measures 21 and 22 between the dotted quarter and the upper notes. A way to fix this is to either remove the dense intervals, or address the next criticism.

* The left hand is not engaged enough. 

The majority of the time the left hand plays single notes or a trill between chords. This is not a very pianistic way of writing things. Writing more like 30-31 and 33-34 is excellent as it breaks up the monotony. Right now the left hand makes the piece very unidimensional. If you were to simply mix up how the left hand articulates and voices chords the piece would become a million times more expressive. Consider even having the left hand play simple counterpoint by making a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or simply imitate the right hand in the negative space. Writing with both hands in mind will make the piece more mature.

I hope this helps. You have a lot of talent and I hope to hear more from you in the future.

*Now the feedback you were asking for:*

There are few moments where the same melody is played by at least 2 instruments. Maybe you could try with a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> instead of duplicating it. It might make the track sturdier.

I don't know, see how it works. Compare how those 2 things sound. In the end, what matters is if you like it. If theory doesn't do the job, then you don't use it on the song.
</p></li><li><p><b>BeachCity</b> 2016-08-04 10:03:57 Chrisewoi<br>&gt; There are few moments where the same melody is played by at least 2 instruments.

You're right, and in fact.. there's 4 instruments playing the melody. Guitar playing it in 2 octaves, violin, synth, and ukulele sample. It might sound a bit weird cos the uke sample I just quickly recorded with my headset and trimmed in audacity and dropped it in so the timing is a little off. 

&gt; Maybe you could try with a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> instead of duplicating it. It might make the track sturdier.

What I was going for I guess - the closest I can compare it to is probably [this](https://youtu.be/siW-wd3HeIs?t=136) from a Bioshock Infinite DLC. You walk through this town and the instruments change as you pass through it and they are all playing this lovely melody. Listen to a minute of that and you'll get the idea. I was just trying to get a specific sound and I was going for a more melody driven song with this song so I thought it would work. I don't know if it works or not but I like how it sounds. I thought adding a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> might've just made it too complicated. If I keep working on it I'll have a play with it though and see what I can get to work. 

I really just start with an idea or none and throw shit at the wall until something sticks. With this though it did pretty much all come together in my head so I just pieced it together. I like starting with one layer and adding more layers as the song goes on so I might extend it out and add some other bits to it. Thanks again for the feedback!
</p></li><li><p><b>BeachCity</b> 2016-08-04 10:46:32 Ezk_R<br>Most of the time I also work that way, adding stuff and see what happens.

The truth is, if it ain't broken, don't fix it haha. I just suggested to try a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> because I thought it might give you an extra layer of possibilities to explore. But more complicated doesn't mean necessarily better. Sometimes complexity ends up f-ing things.

But it just seems kinda empty for a 3min track, i was waiting for like a sequenced vocal <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, like you did add the piano and the "peeeow" which were cool but i wanted some crazy synth sound to come and fuck me in the ear with a wonky reverb soaked future, G Jones melody.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2016-08-13 11:47:32 jigga19<br>Maybe not directly what you're looking for - and it will take you a LOT of time - but try and copy actual manuscripts as practice.  

When I was sixteen, I was given notation software because I was really in to music and my parents thought it would be a fun distraction for me.  I had no idea how to use it (at first).  During that time I saw "A Clockwork Orange" and fell in love with Walter Carlos' moog performance of Beethoven's 9th.  So I went and got the manuscript and copied the ENTIRE thing, note for note.  As I went along I got faster, learned shortcuts (this is where I learned the magic of CTRL+C and CTRL+V), and it didn't help that I lost the entire thing and had to start from scratch.  But I finished the entire damn thing, and it took me probably six months from beginning to end, but the amount I learned from layering, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, structure, and so on, is something I could never have learned from a book.  

Since then, I'm constantly listening for the structure, key-changes, how the bass sits with the guitars, what synthesizers are playing (square, saw, etc.) and it's really neat for me, although people always think I look annoyed when I go to shows because that's what I'm processing in my head.  

As with all things music, it takes time and practice.  Yeah, those scales suck, but they pay off in the end. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2016-08-16 11:01:01 TheGreatEscaper<br>Nice! I really like how this piece has a clear tonality but isn't restricted by typical classical/romantic harmonies.

It's a very nice piece to listen to, here are some things I noticed: in the score you have quite a few G flats, which really should be written as F sharps. Harmonically they function as the third in a dominant/diminished chord in your piece, so they should be written as an F sharp. It's easier for the performers to read, and it makes it clearer what the purpose of the note is.

Another nitpicky writing thing is the way the piano part is formatted in the main theme. It's quite oddly placed in the score, with the E flat positioned to the left of all the other notes. Listening carefully to your audio it appears the purpose of this is to have the E flat played before the other notes (that technically should be played at the same time). This is a kind of odd way to show this to the player, it's not particularly easy to read either. I'd recommend having it and the A as grace notes (that go E flat A) and having the E flat grace note tie over to the normal note. This would remove the odd formatting and make it a lot clearer to the player how you want it to be played.

For a Violin Sonata with Piano Accompaniment, the piano part is surprisingly more difficult than the violin part! As a violin and piano player I can say that you can definitely utilize a lot more of the violin. Especially in a layered piece like this, the violin part could benefit from double-stopped sections - where the violin plays on multiple strings at once. If you're not a string player yourself you'll have to do a bit of research as to what is and isn't possible, but the violin can play multiple voices that don't have to move at the same time. This could help make the piano part less dense in some points and make the piece more soloistic for the violin. If you plan on writing other movements, or more pieces involving strings, I'd recommend that you listen to a few concertos to see what the instrument is capable of. Tremolos, chords, spiccato, pizzicato, there are a lot of textures that a violin can produce. Right now the violin part is a little bit flat.

I know that this piece is supposed to have classical influences (made clear by your 'write like Mozart' description on the Soundcloud track) but the restatement of the main melody could do with some more development. Right now it's note for note a repeat of the beginning with a different cadence. For example, a new <b><u>countermelody</u></b> could run in doublestops on the violin part. Or even just a bit of embellishment could make it a bit more interesting. Otherwise the listener is hearing something they've heard before, exactly the same.

On the topic of sameness can I ask why you chose to write the final repeat as a second time bar? The only difference appears to be a rit., which stylistically is something the players would do naturally at the end of a piece like this. If you really want to make sure that the players will do it anyway, you could simply have a (rit. second time) marking. It might just be me but I usually don't like seeing first/second time bars that are very similar. 

Another thing I just noticed is that after every rit/accel you mark 'moderato'. Typically it's easier to just mark 'A Tempo' or 'Tempo Primo', which is more recognizable to players as 'return to the original tempo'. Putting moderato everywhere just looks a bit odd on a score, especially when there is a more widely accepted and easier to understand at a glance method of marking a return to an old tempo.

The middle section after the first repeat is a little dry. Dynamically it has drama but for me it lacks a bit of something. I can't put my finger on it, but it sounds a little bit hollow to me.

That's about it; I know everything I've written here is a suggestion for improvement, but don't get me wrong, the piece is great! I myself prefer comments with a lot of suggestions for improvement rather than general 'It's nice' comments, so that's typically what I post in respond to others, especially a post like yours which specifically asks for a lot of feedback. Welcome to Reddit, welcome to the composers subreddit, hope I could help a little :)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-08-27 19:45:41 xiipaoc<br>&gt; V7/IV, which means the D7 chord with the fourth in the bass, or does that mean either the V7 or the IV can be played?

It means the V7 *of* the IV chord.  The IV chord is C, so its V7 is G7.  This is known as a secondary dominant.

&gt; What is the difference between IV and iv. I thought that upper case for used to denote major chords and lower case for minor chords?

That is correct.  IV is C and iv is Cm.

&gt; but those notes don't HAVE to be the highest note in the chord to denote a melody?

That's right, they certainly don't!  In this case, you have something called a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, which is a melody secondary to the main melody.  Actually, I'm not sure that the descending line even makes it that far -- it's just a descending line.  It's just that lines like this are really prominent.  If you were playing this with a band, you can bet that the trombone player or someone would play it, scooping into each note.  By the way listen to this, specifically the second time through the melody, when the muted trumpet does it:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q0zZ0VdlUM

Third time the banjo plays it, but it's kind of left out during the other solos (clarinet, trombone).  Then there's a sung chorus, and the singer himself does it!  There's a *different* chromatic line in the piano during the second time through the trumpet solo later on.  (By the way, I'm enjoying the hell out of this clarinetist!)  Last time through the trumpet does it again.

Did you notice that the very first time through -- but not the other times -- the chords at the end of the second phrase were ii - V instead of just V - V?  It's a very valid option!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-08-28 03:25:34 PaapiPet<br>thanks again. I think I got a little of what you said but I can't really follow your analysis of the link. My ears aren't practiced enough I guess.

&gt;By the way listen to this, specifically the second time through the melody, when the muted trumpet does it

By does 'it', do you mean play the <b><u>countermelody</u></b>? Because what I hear is many many different melodies throughout the song all based on the original structure set by the main melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>drumline</b> 2016-08-29 09:56:08 jthurman<br>Drummers (especially rudimental drummers who are snare-centric) often have a hard time writing "melodies." Each phrase needs some "melody" - a line that is the most interesting, which provides the motivating material musically. Then, we add to that either harmony, accompaniment, or <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.

In this cadence, I can rarely pick out which part is the melody. Melody doesn't have to come from playing different notes. It can come from playing accents, shots, etc... But it needs to go beyond just the rhythm.

My advice to you is to go back and consider what the "melodies" are that you want to use, and then ask yourself 1. Does each part contribute to the melody, either as support or <b><u>countermelody</u></b>? and 2. Does each melodic line either lead to the next melody naturally, or does the next melody come as a complete (and pleasant) surprise. Both of those approaches are good. Use them both to create an interesting piece of music.

Finally, a couple notation things:

* Someone already mentioned putting the notes for tenors and basses in the correct spaces. I'll also point out that they should not be in bass clef, but in a percussion clef (unless you're telling us to use those actual pitches, in which case you're writing for the wrong instruments. :) )

* I don't like using the "big slash" notation for bass unisons in the same bar as splits. If the whole bar is unison, then the big slashes are OK, but if any of the bar is split, I include all the notes of the unison. Many will disagree with me, and that's OK, but my experience with lines I've written for has been that it's easier to read that way.

* Look at your snare part in m. 5. Beats 3 and 4 are awkwardly written. This is a poor way of saying this, but try to keep each beat "self-contained." What I mean is, the quarter note that's on the A of 3 should really be a second 16th note. I would have written this figure as an 8th and 2 16ths, with either a quarter rest or a tied quarter note for 4 (I would have gone for the quarter rest, but I can see it both ways). As it is, it's awkward, and will be almost a guaranteed sight-reading fail for a player.
* In m. 14, beat 3. The 16th rest in the snare part doesn't really convey anything useful. Use an eighth note instead of the 16th note/16th rest. For an instrument with no active release, this will sound exactly the same, and be easier to read.

* Other places, this same thing appears - a 16th note/16th rest where an 8th note would convey the same rhythm more easily. For example, final bar, quad part, beat 3. A dotted 8th/16h would be a better choice here, and easier to read.

You can alternate two different synths after the beat drop to give a question-answer sense without adding any note and but making one of them playing the notes sightly faster with a little more ornament... Idk I'm just starting and I do something more organic but I think that might work on electronic music as well.
Also you should try add a bridge, try change the chords, or making other kind of changes to give it the sense of a bridge.

This is one of my first compositions. I don't have any experience with arranging or orchestration, but I'm taking a 300 level course in the fall, so I thought I'd try my hand at something. I used Muscore, and the instruments are Vibraphone, cello, tambourine, oboe, and French Horn. I didn't do anything with the dynamics, and the tambourine is too loud, so just bear that in mind.

My concept for the song was to only use the IV and V chord for the entire first section of the song, and create anticipation for the I chord. I tried to create a texture of gradually overlapping ostinatti. Eventually it does go to the I chord, and I wanted the overall texture of the piece to shift into a higher register at this point. The French Horn provides a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to the Oboe, and rather than writing a new <b><u>countermelody</u></b> for the I section, I kept it the same, in an attempt to recontextualize it in a new harmony.

Let me know what you think.

Very abstract, but has good elements to it, I think it sounds good and you could either keep this fragmented feel, or with maybe a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or something make it feel more refined. totally up to you though, keep it up. https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/50le7w/official_daily_feedback_thread_september_01_2016/d754ztu

Then at Bar 4 paste the Movement up at fifth. Make sure to edit the dissonances that were created in the transposition process but essentially keep the rhythmic elements the same. Another very good tip I have is to use inverted 3rds to create a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, have it running with your melody, maybe at a softer velocity . So for example if I have a melody that goes,( in C major)  C, G, E, A, A, F, G - My counter melody would be A, D, C, F, F, D, F(The f could the become a D, to enhance and create tension leading into a perfect cadence in Cmaj (Gmaj chord to Cmaj)

One day, Yeezy probably spends a few hours listening to and working on beats, signs off on a new YZY piece, reviews fabric choices for Season 4. Another day, he might be sketching out clothing designs for several hours, and only give a new beat from 40 a quick listen, suggesting a different <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. 

Basically, he drifts in and out of projects as needed, because he's drawn in such a strong network of talent. He doesn't have to be hands on 24/7, just enough to plant the seed, guide the project, put in his influence when needed.

Some Love is 100 BPM. Justin Bieber's Sorry is also exactly 100 BPM. They even use the exact same IV-VI-V lead-in with the same rhythm (at exactly 0:48 in Some Love *and* Sorry). They both use synth pads with the same habanera rhythm (3-3-2). The flute synth in Some Love is playing almost the same melody as the chopped up vocal in Sorry, and the slightly more percussive synth afterwards plays a very similar <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to the trumpet synth in Sorry. The beat itself is also basically identical.

Nothing wrong with either song, and Some Love obviously has its own quirks, but it's no secret that big k-pop companies pretty much ask songwriting camps to give in their own versions of particular songs, and I'd bet a lot of money that they referenced Sorry to make Some Love.

For such a thumping dance track, it has a surprisingly minimal beat. Almost all of the momentum of the track instead relies on those chugging layers of synths, which is a clever trick. It's not until the very end where the beat absolutely kicks up a notch by adding all that metallic, organic percussion. It's also probably one of the few pop songs where vocal 'ahs' are used as an element to total perfection (particularly obvious starting at 3:03), without ever sounding cheap and make for good lead-in into the vocal swell <b><u>countermelody</u></b> they add at 3:39 until the end.

It's absolute top-tier Max Martin writing.

With another long groan accompanying a particularly shrill note from both cat and phone, Lark rolls over, getting a sideful of squirming cactus in the process (Complete with indignant hissing) and reaches for his metalink, all but immune to the dozens of tiny stab wounds that Finch was currently inflicting upon him. Bleary, sleep-deprived eyes focused in on the screen and after a few seconds of staring, Lark sits up.

Rubbing his messy hair, he examines the unsigned advertisement, his golden eyes rather predictably drawn to the Nuyen amount rather prominantly displayed in the middle of the message... The adept absently slips off the bed, pointedly ignoring the triumphant little hiss from Finch, and wanders over to the window, absently filling out the personal detail boxes with obviously falsified infomation.

</p></li><li><p><b>ableton</b> 2016-09-17 02:24:29 ZenoGrigio<br>Hello! I'm working on this at the moment as well

Some of my thoughts so far (on which I wouldn't mind a bit of feedback on from some more experienced drum programmers):

1) Programming: two ways of creating 'flow' are timing and articulation 

- Articulation: in short you need to vary the velocity of the midi info (or level if you're working in audio) so that each sound has phrasing within the bar, across the whole the and within 4/8/16 bar loop etc - these phrases should interact with the other drums and the rest of the music the same way a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or harmony part would interact with the melody

- Timing: drummers don't hit every beat in time so if you want a human feel one tip is to input the midi by hand and *not* quantize it or perhaps play with your quantization settings to "improve timing" but not completely "fix" it; this characteristic of human drummers also allows them to play strong beats in time but play with the timings *between* those main beats - this is called "swing" and can really help the drums flow (you can guarantee any decent break beat will have very subtle and sometimes varied swing); you can "groove" a midi or warped audio track on ableton in the clip editer - this just applies various forms of swing to your track

2) Sampler: 

- Layering your samples with a group of Simplers on each drum rack pad really helped me; on Simpler there's a selectable low-pass/high-pass filter so you can quickly EQ out the top end of one sample and the low end of another so they sit nicely on top of each other (perhaps you have a great hefty snare sound but it needs more fizz to groove better with a funky hi hat part - with simpler you can take the heft out of your second snare so it doesn't get too muddy and the top out of the original snare so it doesn't clash)

- The decay times; you might start with a great sounding kit that doesn't flow at your tempo - you may need to make the samples shorter or longer so the hits flow into each other nicely 

- Varying your samples (four different ride samples for example would work) so it sounds like the imaginary drummer isn't quite hitting the same spot every time - this also helps with the *articulation* we discussed above - again you can do this with a group of simplers on your drum rack and you use a velocity sensitive chain selector (100% velocity for example might play your ride "bell" sample)

3) Effects: EQ/side-chaining/gated reverb/ reverb/ transient shaping/parallel compression - speak for themselves if you know what I'm talking about but are too much to explain right now if you don't; its all about getting the kit to "breath"; sidechaining is making room for the important hits while also allowing some parts to wash or splash over the top; reverb also locates the drums in an imagined space and allows the volume to pump up and down a little in a manner that fits the groove; good EQing should clear out all the mud and with transient shaping you can tweak the punch of the hits; gated reverb lays emphasis on the snare but keeps it out of the way of the kick; parallel compression glues everything together and adds 'in-your-face'-ness

4) Mixer: Pan the elements of a super compressed drumkit as if you're sitting behind the kit (hats on the left etc) but pan a reverby kit as if you're looking at it from the front (hats on the right etc)
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2016-09-17 13:53:27 inmyshoes47<br>yo I can see this turning into a really dope song.  I agree about the vocals being rough, but just focusing on the instrumental for a moment: I feel like this needs a big pad to give it some atmosphere, and I feel like you could get a really killer <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to come in at some point to work in tandem w/ that bass (which is sweet, btw).  All in all, good shit bro
</p></li><li><p><b>DestinyTheGame</b> 2016-09-24 04:02:56 ike_the_strangetamer<br>I think the new soundtrack is mediocre. Destiny's original music had a lot of thought &amp; polish. So many distinct elements that fit together. You could hear the love put into it. 

RoI's soundtrack doesn't live up. It's good, but it sounds like every other game soundtrack. The chanting voices are a bit cliché. There's one main theme, but it's used over and over again and without any interesting <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. Overall I think it's lacking depth.
</p></li><li><p><b>gamedev</b> 2016-09-25 14:51:44 SickAcorn<br>Cool stuff! Very professional-sounding overall, nice chord structure (the intro reminded me of Undertale in a good way), and the melody is strong enough while still being fitting as game music. There were a couple spots in the melody that you could clean up a bit possibly, but overall it sounded great.

One thing you could try: maybe play with the instrumentation a bit? For example, given the setting you mentioned, I feel like a flute or glockenspiel <b><u>countermelody</u></b> would fit in very well. The bell-like synth you had towards the end was fantastic, and I'd love to have heard more of it!

Once again, good work.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-09-25 16:38:06 MiskyWilkshake<br>Thing is, he's not actually playing chords so much as a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> which is (generally) doubled at the octave. Now, this might imply full chords when paired with the original melody, but at each point in the song, there's usually only 1 or 2 distinct pitches being sounded.

Bar 2 forms an A5 chord, which implies Am, given the other notes in the song, and that sounds to me like the tonic. Bar 4 forms an Fomit5 chord, which implies Fmaj (the bVI chord), and then we're back to the tonic in bar 6. The rest is kind of vague, and could be interpreted differently depending on how you look at it.

Hope that helps.

[Sarah Hawke](http://i.imgur.com/7F8ihBu.jpg) died in the fade to make sure the Inquisitor and the others escaped to safety. She made this decision in the Inquisitor’s stead, and passed away mid-battle with the giant demon. After coming to terms with his grief, Varric slightly rewrote “The Tale of the Champion” to put Hawke in a somewhat better light instead of the romanticized-yet-true account he originally put down. The literary world would ultimately remember the funny yet caring woman rather than the broken apostate. 

*(The two following are subject to change based on what happens in DA4.)*

[Keeran Trevelyan](http://imgur.com/a/SllMI) will die many decades in the future, old and grey, but still with that glint of mirth and rashness he had in his youth. Unfortunately, the influence of the mark, even though decades gone, shortened his life by several years. So he has to endure a slightly less-grey Dorian losing his composure in private moments. Keeran will peacefully pass in his sleep, resting in bed in a house full of loved ones and dear friends. His funeral will be so extravagant that it will somewhat overshadow the legend of the man himself. 

***

After a long and lonesome search, [Kallian](http://imgur.com/a/qdlYU) will fail to find a cure for the taint in her blood. 

After the events of DA4, (since Leliana is going to be part of it in some way, probably as a cameo), Kallian and Leliana basically retire from their respective services. Cassandra as Divine Victoria understands the decision, though it makes her a little grumpy, and the wardens just have to deal with Kallian walking away. The two of them spent the better part of the previous ten years very far apart, and their relationship suffered for it. Never again. 

Vowing to spend the remaining two decades of Kallian’s life in peace, they retire to Orlais and live in the large house Leliana grew up in. For many years, they live a quiet and happy domestic life, but do keep in contact with their friends and SOMETIMES lend a hand if they’re sorely needed. Nothing world-shattering though. (basically leaving the door open for future cameo appearances) For a long time, the threat of Kallian’s shortened life completely exits both of their minds and they just… live. Money is not a problem, neither are they hampered by any social pressures. Such highlights include the very first time they receive a letter from Cyrion, who they taught to read and write following the blight. Also, Kallian will learn to speak Orlesian behind Leliana’s back, though she will never get rid of her horrible Denerim accent. Leliana will cook simple Ferelden pottage for Kallian now and then, to remind her of home. Though the ingredients would be much higher quality.

And then one day, twenty years after their proclamation that they would never be apart again… Kallian disappears. Over the previous few months, she had grown noticeably weaker and paler, and prone to coughing fits, but she never let it slow her down. She even resorted to using cosmetics on her face to hide the black veins in her neck and dark circles under her eyes. In fact, she resisted the calling much longer than most wardens, and extended her time with Leliana for many months, possibly a year. But eventually, she could no longer resist the song and decided to end her life as all wardens do, before she became a gibbering invalid. Kallian journeys alone to Orzammar, wearing her many-decades-old uniform, with her mother’s dagger at her side. She faces her worst fear alone and in darkness, but she slaughters more darkspawn than she can count before it’s all over. 

Leliana never gets to say goodbye, nor did she get any warning. Instead, she just wakes up one day to an empty bed, with a handwritten letter on Kallian’s pillow. The words on the paper boil down to “I’m sorry”, which leaves Leliana devastated. In her grief, Leliana abandons her home and everything inside, and walks north. She spends a very long time on the road, watching the world pass before her eyes. Eventually, she finds a small town near the Tevinter border, where few people know about the dramas of the recent past, and fewer care. The town has a small chantry, a quaint little place that reminds her very much of Lothering. The first thing she does is take a small and withered rose, found on the side of the road somewhere, and plants it near the edge of the chantry’s garden. Then she walks in.

Over the next few decades, the newest lay sister becomes as much a leader of the community as the revered mother. In fact, Leliana refuses to be elevated in rank, no matter how many people in the sleepy town beg her to accept more responsibility. As she grows older and her red hair turns grey, people even whisper how natural she would be as Divine, but she refuses that even harder. Instead, Leliana busies herself with keeping the chantry garden tended, the building clean, and prayers seen to every day. She also becomes and invaluable source of advice and support for the townsfolk, ingratiating herself in their lives and becoming a staple figure for support. Although, her faith in the Maker isn’t quite what it used to be. Instead of blindly quoting scripture at people’s problems, she gives advice based on her long life and her terrible experiences. In many ways, older Leliana acts like [Brother Ray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Med_pNazwEY) from Game of Thrones.  (Don't even think about clicking that link if you're a fan of the show and haven't caught up with the latest season. Spoilers within the first half second.)

One thing Leliana does, no matter how old she gets and how feeble her joints become, is set aside a little bit of time every day near sunset, to sit near a small pile of rocks at the corner of the chantry garden and talk. The little rose she planted on her first day blossomed into a gigantic and beautiful bush that covers a huge area, except for the pile of stones she keeps meticulously clean. Most people assumed she took that time and that spot to pray in private, so they never bothered her about it. No one in the sleepy town ever knew who she was [really speaking to.](https://youtu.be/ZxYoJCvfgBk?t=14m44s)

And then, one day many decades after Kallian disappeared in the deep roads, Sister Leliana passes in her sleep. The townsfolk bury her next to her roses, under the small cairn she already set up. So far in the future, the legacy of the Hero of Ferelden is lost except in a few local stories and legends down south. But in the combined mourning for Leliana, the town gives Kallian a sendoff as well. Each rose taken from the bush is an inadvertent reminder of what had been lost, and what had been gained because of her.

**Prompt 2**

**Kallian** can’t dance, nor does she sound right when she tries to hum, much less sing. And she doesn’t do very well in front of crowds. Like when Alistair gave his climactic speech before the battle of Denerim, Kallian remained totally silent due to her nerves. However, she’s in a very close relationship with someone who is a natural performer and has no problem getting in front of crowds. Kallian would most likely play the “lovely elven assistant” to whatever act Leliana deems would have the biggest impact. Singing a song is likely out of the question because Leliana would have to teach Kallian how to provide backup chords with a lute, and that probably wouldn’t go over very well. Most likely, they would astound the crowd with a display of rogue/bardic skills. Maybe something like restraining the lovely elf to a wall and precision throwing knives around her. Or maybe some stage magic performed through Leliana’s knowledge of trickery and sleight of hand. The “cut someone in half” trick would be pretty easy considering how small and thin Kallian is. 

For some reason (pretty much why I came up with this question), I have this uncontrollable image in my head of a very drunk postgame **Sarah Hawke** walking up on stage with an anachronistic modern setup, her friends behind her. And then she sings “[Fall to Pieces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JhsUFuqbCM)” by Velvet revolver. Also this is also motivated by an equally strong mental image of Fenris wearing Slash’s leather jacket, hat and sunglasses, totally killing it on lead guitar. (Isabela on bass, Carver on rhythm guitar and very salty about not being lead, Varric on drums. Merrill stands on the side providing a lovely <b><u>countermelody</u></b> on a keyboard, but it’s not plugged in.)

We decided the first 4 Gems' instruments by their personalities and how they fit together as an ensemble (bass as foundation; drums for momentum/energy; piano as harmony or melody depending on the situation; chiptune as melody or supporting <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.) As we established the musical style for the show, the rules got a bit more complex and newer characters' instruments had to fit into that style, while also reflecting who they are and where they come from! --A

I know J. cole did this a lot in 2014 FHD so check that out for some examples

* 0:08 - Re-listen to the bass rhythm. Particularly to the last beat of the pattern.
* Nice job on all the little detail notes! 
* 0:44 - Careful of the notes in the <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. Slowing down the track is crucial to hearing this one.
* 0:49 - Check the melody here, I think the second note is incorrect. 
* 1:33 - The pitch bend in the melody here is imprtant. I'd put it in somehow.
* 1:43 - Missed an important bit here. Give another listen!
* You left out the ending, which I think is pretty important. It connects the end to the beginning and transitions perfectly out of the world of guitars back into chiptune land. But up to you.

Great work!

Lots of subtle effects, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and bass notes color the region much nicer with headphones in.
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2016-10-10 01:30:25 Renal_Toothpaste<br>dark ass melody, I love it. You went in on those hats, sounds dope. I really liked the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that comes in at 1:45, wish it was a bit louder though. I'm a fan of 808 slides too, you pulled them off well. Clean mix, overall, good beat.
</p></li><li><p><b>MonsterHunter</b> 2016-10-12 10:59:57 resquall<br>The Pokemon style definitely works a lot better, but even then it would be fairly bland as a song from RBY. Even with the tastefully added Pokemon-esque arpeggios, the melody really isn't much to listen to. Perhaps that strays too far into my own opinions about the Zinogre theme as a whole, though. Player 3 did a great job. 

This remix, however, doesn't add that much to make it like Final Fantasy music. Beyond the classic battle theme bassline, nothing else is reminiscent of Nobuo Uematsu's work; neither the added <b><u>countermelody</u></b> nor the percussion is done in his style.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2016-10-13 15:51:16 Singdancetypethings<br>I like it.

Very somber and stately beginning, a bit more formal than generally seen. Were you thinking about *Titanic* when you wrote this? Because I hear definite similarities between the two.

Vis-a-vis the repetitive thing: yes, it's too repetitive (though still miles better than my efforts). If I were looking to improve on this score, I'd put in a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> and alternate them, building to the counterpoint between the two.

Still, great job!

I love, on Burnin' from Homework, the background sound that is remotely like a cross between a siren and bubbles. On Motherboard from RAM, I love the really airy sidechained kick in the second half. In Revolution 909, the "wow" sound that plays almost through the entire song puts me in a trance. In Discovery, I love every last detail, in every last song. The aforementioned bongos in Crescendolls have always been a favorite, but I also love the higher pitched, quick vocal sample in High Life and the little sparkles at the end of the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in Face to Face. As a final thought, the chants that begin around 5 minutes in Too Long are one of the most dance worthy sounds from the album. My favorite album of all time.
</p></li><li><p><b>radiohead</b> 2016-10-15 03:04:24 hhistory<br>The guitar <b><u>countermelody</u></b> doesn't compliment the opening verse melody.  I think I'm hearing two related but different keys at 38 seconds (really, same at beginning, too)

The original vocal melody is built with harmonic implications in the original key.  While most of the notes are the same as in the Creep key (for example C and F share all but Bb and B), a melody sung over a I--IV-V-I progression in C just won't quite sound right over another progression in F.  Melodies move where harmonies want to go.  Change the harmonies and the game you set up in your melody just won't work in the new context.  

Not doing it for me.

But I do like the pic.  
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2016-10-19 21:20:06 hystericaldominolego<br>Really, just mess around and write it down somewhere, either by hand or digitally.

Composition starts with an idea that gets built upon in other parts. One technique you can use is to have a variation on the same melody, like putting it in a different time signature or with a different rhythm or something. Maybe you could try using it as a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to something else.

Seriously, just start experimenting with it. Your first stuff won't be that great - mine was absolutely awful - but if you keep at it, you'll quickly see your improvement piece to piece.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2016-10-21 03:52:24 Scrapheaper<br>1. Decide which category of part I want- melody/<b><u>countermelody</u></b>, harmonic definition (chords) or rhythmic part. Sometimes the lines between the different categories blur slightly. If it's harmonic definition or rhythmic part, I need to decide how long the loop of the note rhythms is.
Do I want it to 'follow' another existing element, or contrast with it? It has to be one or the other, going halfway is no good.

2. Write the chords, then decide how to fit the loop into the chords so that no notes clash (I rarely use only one key/'scale', I find it makes for harmonically boring music)

3. Add fills and variations.

4. I normally start with large scale structure (build/drop or verse/chorus or minimal or whatever) so lastly I need to work out how to transition into the next section. This is often the hardest part to do neatly

</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2016-10-21 12:23:28 Ruinscaper<br>The beat is quite repetitive, I assumed I could get away with that since it was so short but I'll definitely avoid that next time around! 
Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it!

In regards to Bottle Opener; I thoroughly enjoy this.
I really enjoy the melody on it, I think adding a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> on top of that would help add to the complexity of the beat but even without it's still fantastic. I love how almost, if not all, of the bars were different. That really allowed for it to keep my attention throughout! Keep creating man, and thanks again!

You can if you want to.  The formula for a Triad is 1,3,5 - D, F#, A in the D Major Scale.  Two *inversions* can be created by rearranging the Intervals:

1,3,5 = D, F#, A; root position

3,5,1 = F#, A, D; first inversion

5,1,3 = A, D, F#; second inversion

These are all legitimate D Major Triads.  

The reason why you would not want D in the bass position on a regular basis is to do with tonality.  The Root (1) is the most powerful Interval in the Triad; if you emphasise another Interval then it can weaken the sound of the Triad.

You may want to use inversions if you are in other areas of the neck aside from the Open position, or perhaps to create a smooth bass note melody/<b><u>countermelody</u></b> if you are fingerpicking/arpeggiating chords, or creating a counterpoint part.

**1. SwigglesRP &amp; Tera C - One Winged Angel - FFVII**

You’ve developed the intro section to a point where it sounds totally different but you can still recognize it which I really like. You’ve also went all the way with the vocals especially since there’s a good bit of latin.

**2. Toxodentrail - Rising Sun - Okami**

I do think that you definitely play to your strengths and you made a cover that demonstrates that but is also different at the same time.

**3. Dacian Grada - The Vengeful Spartan - God of War**

What I liked about it was that you made it a metal cover whilst keeping it in the same spirit of the original, such as keeping a orchestral instrumentation including the choir that make up the motif.

**4. Sharp Rain Music - Kefka’s Theme - FFVI**

I was really surprised with this one man! Would I be right in saying that you made the lyrics to his perspective? If so, then I think there’s something there that makes it sound appropriate to the whole piece.

**5. Subversiveasset - Fortune Teller 2 - Tactics Ogre**

I really enjoyed listening to this one! I particularly like the piano backing and the blend of melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> with the saxophone. Also, your reverb is really starting to compliment your saxophone and I definitely think you’ve avoided using too much. Good one!

Honorable Mentions

**ImAFutureGuitarHero - Temple of Time - LOZ - OOT**

Sounds less like church music and more like a band jamming in D dorian. I have to applaud that you took the main melody and made that a basis of a jam with band instruments. Well done

**Pegster McDudeson - Temple of The Sea God - Golden Sun**

This was a very creative one! The ambient slide guitar was a nice touch. Have you tried using volume swells for that part. I imagined it sounding more ambient. For the later part you can hear the Pink Floyd influence coming through which sounded great. Keep it up man, it’s sounding good. :)
</p></li><li><p><b>CarSeatHR</b> 2016-11-01 12:59:27 affen_yaffy<br>in the previous version, there was the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> of "Telstar" that rose out of the collision at the end, I miss it, but it had to go for legal reasons- plus it's not like the old version is hard to find.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2016-11-03 01:24:18 DRL47<br>Any instrument or combination of instruments can create counterpoint. Most popular music is homophonic, but sometimes there is some type of <b><u>countermelody</u></b> which may or may not follow strict counterpoint rules. Some bass lines are complex enough to qualify as counterpoint.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2016-11-09 06:53:57 youractualaccount<br>I use FL for now, and what you heard, is the limit of my ability to use it so far. 

Music Theory Rant Incoming:

I did a little analysis of your tune, and harmonically, it is bananas. It's almost in Gflat for the first 4 notes, but that C natural is out of nowhere. Then going down it's like you're almost in g harmonic minor. 

I probably wouldn't change anything about whats going on with the melody, because it's already really complex. It seems like you have a Bb going to Cb, then back down to Bb, then surprisingly up to C. That is shocking to the ear. Not at all what one would expect. Not to suggest that it's bad, because its really quite cool. Then you hopped down to G, then F#. Then it repeats. And does that in 6 bar cycles in 4/4 time. Wow. Take my word for it; that is unique. Especially for hip-hop/EDM. 

If I were going to add anything to that, maybe a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> over it, like D&gt;D#&gt;F&gt;E&gt;Bb&gt;Bb That would harmonize the melody in a way that kind of outlines a key, if you were interested in that kind of thing. 

But it's always challenging to make out notes when there's lots of distortion and feedback on the tones, so I could have missed the actual pitches. 
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2016-11-11 14:08:28 ZermeloMusic<br>Love the deep lows. Although, you could roll off some &lt;40Hz, and I’d tighten the low end with an envelop shaper like the LFO Tool. 

Actually, as I listen to the track, the deep lows seem misplaced. I’d focus on making the track sound more ambient. When you have everything side chained it takes away from the airy ambient quality. If something is truly in the background, it wouldn’t be affected in dramatic ways. It would just ring out. So, I’d tone the lows way down, and significantly shorten the kick. Make it more of a punch than a drone.

I thought there could have been a better transition into the build at 340. Also, lone melodies need some kind of contrasting part. It can be a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> with a slow rhythm or a static string or something. It just needs something to contrast with. So I’d add something else in that break to give the melody a more interesting context.

Finally, I really think that the kick would benefit from a subtle click. I’m not talking about the EDM level clicks, just something that adds a little articulation to it.

Good stuff!
</p></li><li><p><b>makinghiphop</b> 2016-11-17 07:56:56 ThirdRule<br>Roof top is real good, shows you have potential. You use the main melody well but I really liked when you used the higher pitched <b><u>countermelody</u></b> which comes in occasionally, like at around 30 seconds. It gives you a unique edge and I'd enjoy hearing more of your music in the future. Some aspect of your track is giving it a bit of a muffled sound, might be the mixing/mastering, but it feels like the sound you are going for - just feel it takes a bit away from the track. I like the kicks, they compliment the melody nicely, but the claps can be quite light at times.

(Opposite race, opposite personalities- I'm type A, he's a total type B, opposite childhood experiences). When people meet him, they are always surprised he's my spouse. We dated for 14yrs before we got married but we broke up 2ish times during that period. I've always said if we had gotten married earlier, we would have been divorced. But dating that long allowed us to make mistakes and figure things out. I'm happy I married someone opposite of me because he takes me out of my comfort zone. He causes me to see things from a different perspective. He forces me to slow down. He would probably say that I cause him to focus. I drive our family forward. We set goals for our family and I plan how to execute those goals. 

I think when marrying someone opposite you have to know it and know it can be a problem. During premarital counseling, my Pastor pointed this out. His sermon at our wedding was about a song... and how you have the melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. And that sometimes the melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> get out of balance and sound bad. And we need to listen to our song to stay in harmony. 

Anyway, I do think opposites can work well together... but it takes acceptance and work. 

</p></li><li><p><b>explainlikeimfive</b> 2016-11-29 08:47:46 KahBhume<br>I'm not sure how others actually go about their process, but I composed very simple stuff when I was in school. Basically I started off making a melody. There are various chords that sound better when the notes are played together or in succession, cutting down on the notes I would tend to use unless I specifically wanted to make a bit of dissonance. Once I had the melody written, I could add other parts, creating harmony or a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. Occasionally I attempted to fit in a key or timing change, playing with how I could adapt the melody while changing the mood of the piece.

I personally wasn't ever able to fit in more than four voices at any one time, and I was horrible with fitting in percussion. But had I spent more time and perhaps some training, I could have improved my ability. Of course, I probably would never reach the ability of the famous composers most people know. Those people are and were genuinely talented in their field and able to do stuff with music that makes them notable and memorable.
</p></li><li><p><b>AskReddit</b> 2016-12-01 03:38:33 justwhy72<br>Start with the chord structure first. Just the chords. Chord patterns (ABA/AABA) Rondo vs sonata Allegro etc. Then fill in melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.

* Orcs are big on competitive sports, preferably ones that involve combat or a reasonable simulation of it, like wrestling or boxing.
* Elves have music competitions. These can take the form of song duels - either taking turns, or singing over each other with harmony and/or <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. Feel free to imagine elvish rap battles if it amuses you to do so; I have yet to decide if elves have discovered rap, and whether they approve if so.
* Halflings have a game, for which I have not yet developed any specifics, which is somehow symbolic of the balance between order and chaos. 
* Dwarves like games with rules. They would probably enjoy Mao, or one of the games where you invent rules as you go along, as long as they went into it with the expectation that you do not know all the rules in advance. 
* The older dragons play games with kobolds and other less intelligent humanoids as pawns. Their opponents are mostly other dragons, although they will sometimes deign to play with a particularly interesting and powerful vampire. They'd play with elves, but elves don't tend to have minions they're willing to sacrifice.

</p></li><li><p><b>beatles</b> 2016-12-11 03:02:50 325c58<br>It's definitely easier to find them making more important contributions in the early days of the group. The contributions stand out more in the later recordings though. The most difficult part is finding major contributions from George, who was left to feel a bit of a spare wheel on the later recordings. Like playing maracas on "A Day In The Life". I think the trick for this is finding a song, usually a John song since he was the best lyricist (but couldn't do much else but play rhythm guitar exceedingly well), where there is particularly great guitar part or solo played by George, and an uncommonly good drum part by Ringo.

"Help!" stands out for me, because we have Lennon's lead vocal and the meaningful lyrics, the essential <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that McCartney sings, the descending guitar lick that Harrison plays (which is absolutely brilliant, just as Lennon sings "help me if you can I'm feeling down..." there is a descending "duh-duh-duh"), and the rolling on the tom-tom as he plays it by Ringo, in addition to holding the all important beat.

"Nowhere Man" is similar. Lennon's meaningful lyrics and progressions, McCartney providing the harmony and that wonderful understated bassline, George providing some harmony "ah la la" and most importantly playing that beautiful solo/duo with John, and adding the all important harmonic at the end. Ringo adds the roll on the snare, and again adding the all important beat.

"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" again beautiful lyrics, Paul writing the all important Lowrey organ part, sauntering basslines, and singing the first "Lucy in the sky...", Harrison adding the tamboura and Leslie guitar sound adding to the atmosphere of the song, and the waltzing beat laid down by Ringo until it is interrupted by "BUM. BUM. BUM." then right into the chorus. In that one particularly they all had a indisputably important part in making the song so unique.

Had Ringo played drums on "Dear Prudence" I'd say that would be another perfect example. However, John's brilliant song and fingerpicking guitar, Paul's bass playing and drum playing and piano playing, and George's beautiful guitar harmony at end of the song, is maybe the best example of them playing together as three.

"Don't Let Me Down" is really quite perfect in that all the parts interweave so perfectly, everybody is singing harmony, the guitar leads are subtle and sweet, the progressions, the lyrics are so heartfelt and sung with such passion by Lennon. The flawless change to 5/4 time by Ringo, again with indisputably tasteful playing with the unshakeable back beat.

"Come Together" might be a little lacking on Harrison contributions. This is no doubt Ringo's greatest moment, and perhaps one of the only songs that's hook is the drum fill at the beginning of the song. The incredible bass hook by Paul, as well as his baritone harmony, as well as writing the electric piano solo for John to play. John leading the song with his great lyrics, and great chorus which is so simple. Harrison follows with a great yet simple guitar solo, which shimmers in right before the extended outro.

Jesus Christ, after a while it is really hard to think of descriptions or words for things that are just meant to be heard. It's like trying to describe color to a blind person.

Carly turns the heartbroken wistfulness to 11 on ‘Roses’. It’s one of the most obviously structured songs and attempts at a stomping anthemic ballad that Carly has released, but it still feels quite nuanced. The chord progression feels almost unnaturally sad, and the drums feel clipped and restrained, pops rather than bangs, as if holding in some of the fallout. She manages to turn the lyrics into a timeless story, and “All the roses in the garden fade to black” gets repeated with a hypnotic fairytale feeling. By the time the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> of the bridge comes in, it starts to sound like an instant classic. It’s nowhere near as high-energy as some of the other songs on E•MO•TION: Side B, but feels far more mature and representative of Carly’s true prowess. **-raicicle**
</p></li><li><p><b>FL_Studio</b> 2016-12-22 13:03:03 chaseford76<br>I feel like it needs some action in the mid to high range, like maybe a nice synth pad or string pad and a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>

Although it was very rudimentary and perhaps almost lacking in some aspects, it still brought the audience in for what in my opinion jazz is about, which is listening for the purpose of art, or to see the emotion the artist is trying to convey. The way jazz was portrayed has nothing to do with the technical feats of the artist. Neither lead had much broadway singing experience, and a lot of their vocal technique was lacking in many fronts if compared to a "legit" musical and I feel as though it is the same type of criticism when talking about the jazz. Yes, it is not technically inspiring and isn't revolutionary in any case, but how are those things bad to the average audience member? There were enough jazz references and a more musical-jazz approach to the score to appeal to the jazz enthusiast like me and enough basic material to have the audience follow. Never in the movie did I tell myself "Man the texture of that piece was homophonic but should have been more polyphonic with <b><u>countermelody</u></b>!"

Basically I am wondering, to people that hold your criticism, WHY these criticisms to the jazz music necessarily matter to the movie and your enjoyment of it? Thanks again for your response, I love having these types of discussions.

I think there might be some slight sinaesthesia (?) involved at this point because I've spent enough time thinking about how to express emotions and images and personalities through sounds. 

I often experience emotions and impressions of people and situations in total abstract--maybe as a color or a taste, but more often, as a musical phrase, complete with complex harmonies, defined rhythms, and sometimes even a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. I don't "mentally verbalize" the impression (e.g. "Ugh, this is going to just make my life more stressful." "That girl is cute." "I forgot my keys in my other pants.") It's total music. I combine the impressions that affect me most in ways that seem logical. Sometimes this results in completed music, sometimes not!

</p></li><li><p><b>OCPoetry</b> 2017-01-09 09:27:33 brenden_norwood<br>I really enjoyed this piece. The rhymes were immaculate, the presentation/form was unique, and the metaphors were in themselves fascinating. Some thoughts by stanza:

*First Stanza:*

"A marionette who cut her strings" is a fantastic use of paradox. I interpreted it as someone who looked to somebody else for purpose, and when that person left and they were forced to face independence, felt disoriented. The "continent" metaphor is there I believe to communicate the narrator is a free spirit. This is interesting, given the original puppet conceit. Perhaps this is meant to convey a passage of time or a growth of character. If it is that, I would stretch it out longer. But regardless, a good stanza.

*Second Stanza:*

The second stanza had other great paradoxes. "Secret whispered bright," "song unsung," "unread book." I think it's an effective device in this context because it establishes a sort of dissonance in the inward world of the narrator. It also establishes a theme of futility with the imagery of apathetic gods who couldn't care less for some shmuck's dying prayer. This stanza is definitely a powerful one, and really lets the poem build momentum.

*Third Stanza*

"Clothed in cold" is great alliteration. This stanza is curious because it contains religious imagery like the stanza before it. It establishes that the narrator themselves feel enlightened. But, when this idea of being enlightened follow their apathy towards gods, it's curious. It almost makes me think that the entire piece is about a character's disillusionment with modern religion. It's an interesting thing to think about, especially with the puppet conceit mentioned early on. A mountain brings to mind someone who holds steadfast in their beliefs. I also appreciated the contrast in the stanza between hot/cold. It created more dissonance/paradox that I feel, again, fits the themes.

*Fourth Stanza*

I'm not sure why "tyger" is spelled the way it is. The same with "loatheful". Perhaps this is a technique going on, but I feel that if anything, it's distracting. I would just spell the words regularly. Regardless, I felt that this stanza was pretty good. It had another paradox with the idea of a tiger who runs from fights. "Paper tyger" is also good because it also communicates the earlier theme of futility. 

*Fifth Stanza*

This one is interesting. It establishes the narrator is eclectic. The ending packs a good punch too, and I feel like the relative brevity of the piece makes it more powerful.

*Overall*

I would clean up the second to last stanza. And maybe, if you found the religion disillusionment interpretation to be interesting, to work it in more. As the piece is, it feels like it's just creating a character, when I want to know why this character is unique. All I've really learned about them is that they feel a lot of conflicting emotions/internal dissonance. It was beautifully written, but somehow I want to see another theme worked in to really let it shine. Almost like a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> of some kind, if it were a song. It was still really well written. As I said, it had great rhymes, great form, great flow, and the metaphors were really interesting. I also appreciated the poetic devices sprinkled throughout.

Hope my feedback was helpful :)
</p></li><li><p><b>explainlikeimfive</b> 2017-01-11 09:35:36 kouhoutek<br>Sort of, but not quite.

Classical music usually consists of several *parts*.  You can have melody, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, accompaniment, harmony, bass, percussion, solos, etc.

Once these lines of music are determined, they will be assign to various instruments.  Maybe the trumpets and clarinets carry melody, then it switched to violins and flutes.  Or maybe the first violins carry melody while the second violins play <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.  The combinations are endless.

The point is, the composer usually isn't writing a complete version for each instrument.  They figure out what the parts are, then assign largely the same music to different instruments.


</p></li><li><p><b>KingdomHearts</b> 2017-01-12 08:56:17 unwillingly1st<br>Wow. Seriously a new favorite. The voicing in the harmony is quite beautiful, and I appreciate a new <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the oboe.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2017-01-13 18:12:17 ZoeBlade<br>I like this one!  I'm not familiar with the genre, but square waves and 808 snares are always fun...

I like everything that's in this mix, but I think it could stand to have a little more, whether that's more layering going on at any given point in time, or more variety from one point in time to another.  You can kinda combine both: whenever anything repeats, add another layer just for that iteration onwards.

Let's take the main bleepy square wave as a melody.  It's nice.  Try adding a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> on a different instrument to respond to it.  As this one's pretty fast, try something slower maybe.  So they play off each other.

You've sort of got a B section that's just the downbeat stabs, melody gone, which is nice, and then later on both sections play at once, which is a nice trick I use enough as well.

But as your B section doesn't have a melody, there's no B melody...  So try coming up with one, and now you've got a third section to play with and toggle between.  So all these things you're currently doing, toggling between two slightly varying sections that work together, those together are kinda like one big section that can toggle with another, more different one.  And when you start to do that, you realise how short four minutes can be, and suddenly no one says it's repetitive anymore because to make way for that new bit, you've had to compact all the existing really good stuff.

Having said that, I like this as it is.  There's nothing wrong with it.  I just think that next time, with even more variety thrown into the mix, it takes it to the next level.

Oh, a neat thing to try if you haven't already, is a simpler melody but with a delay on it, so the delays sound like other notes in their own right... it's a much easier way to get to what sounds like the kind of complexity you did the hard way.  Both are good, it's just something to look into if you haven't already, it'd be right up your street, I think.  But you probably know all that, in which case, sorry.

Anyway, yeah, in summary I'm really not familiar with the genre, but I love what you've done, and think adding a little more variety will make it even better.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2017-01-14 03:43:18 THCLUTCH<br>Sounds like it's missing something. Maybe add some sort of <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. The mix sounds pretty basic as well [some automation'll go a long way]. Vocal chop sounds good though.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2017-01-15 10:20:19 dingdongsingsongting<br>You just do whatever you want. You're basically asking something that's really to the artist's taste. 

Watch some "track from scratch" videos.

Or what I usually do, take a song, drag it into my DAW, and analyze it.

Here are my philosophies to song design:

1. The instruments should have **contrast** while still fitting the overall theme. 
    
    **Example**: an Asian Flute, and a plucked Asian String instrument. The flute has a low attack, while the string has a sharper attack, so they contrast while fitting the overall theme.

2. The instruments **shouldn't share too much frequency space**. Even with tools like EQ and side-chaining, make sure they're in separate spots along the frequency spectrum. 
      
    **Example**: The flute is in C3, and the string is in C4-C5.

3. There **shouldn't be too many ideas** going on at once. Your brain can't focus on too many elements, so have up to 4 things at once more or less.

    **Example**:

    1. C2-C3 mid bass pads are playing chords
      - C1-C2 808s are playing root notes of the chords

    2. the C4 lead is playing the main melody

    3. the C5 pluck playing the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> 

    4. then drums and SFX

4. For something to be big, **other things have to be small in comparison**. 

   **Example**: For the 808 to smack, the other elements shouldn't have much bass in them. 

5. **Don't put all your eggs in one basket.** Keep cool ideas spread out through your song.

6. When moving through the arrangement, remember rule three. Instead of constantly adding more instruments, **use subtle techniques to build interest**. 

   **Examples**: 
   - By suddenly dropping all the instruments at the end of the bar, it can build tension by catching the breath of the listener
   - When suddenly taking an instrument out of the arrangement, the listener will feel a void in the interest levels. When taking an instrument out of action, try boosting the interest of another instrument/idea that's still playing. ie adding more trills, changing the processing etc.

7. **The song is a story.** Follow the basic plot line you learned in English class. *Introduction, Rising Action, Climax, Conclusion.* Your song should keep on building interest until the end, where the conclusion wraps up the song. 

Any more questions?
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2017-01-15 15:08:56 mssgmx<br>I used to be a church accompanist via piano, and this actually happens a lot, where you get repetitive chords and not much else to play (and as part of the "band" with other guitarists, I used to question my role, but I digress...)


If the song is supposed to be quiet at the beginning (or in any part of the song) I would just play suspended chords and let the main vocalist shine. You can also vary your accompaniment by playing your left and/or right hand parts at different octaves (play the left hand at a lower octave, right hand at a higher octave, or both at a lower octave and move your right hand up and octave each verse, etc).


You can also add variation by adding <b><u>countermelody</u></b> bits in the "breathing measures"- for instance, the vocalist doesn't sing the entire way through, so in the times when they take breaths you can play little trills or an echo of the melody or even a random melody that fits the chord. If you play a different one each time, it helps get rid of the feel of repetitiveness.


Lastly- make sure whatever you're doing, the vocalist is sort of aware that you're doing it, so it doesn't throw them off :) It's always nice to let your fellow performers know what you're doing.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2017-01-18 10:36:12 Pit-trout<br>Pretty sure it's violas on the triplets, for a couple of reasons:

- the single-line staff is a percussion instrument. Assuming standard layout conventions, the staves are grouped as wood winds, then brass, then perc, then strings. So the groups of staves that's playing in the Grave are strings, and by default those go Vln 1, Vln 2, Violas, Cellos, Basses. Of course, that can sometimes change if some of the strings are absent or divisi, but…

- if you read the first two stages of that group in treble clef, the third as viola clef, and the last as bass clef, then it fits together fairly conventionally into the key of Eb. Any other combination of clefs would make it come out as something a bit weird and polytonal — which isn't unthinkable, of course, but is much less likely. And also:

- reading that group as the strings, in the standard order, gives a very classic and effective texture: the violins on melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, violas filling in texture and harmony below them, and cellos (possibly also basses) on the baseline at the bottom.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2017-01-18 15:41:13 Zagorath<br>The thing is, the violi aren't the ones that really matter. They're just filling out the harmony and providing some texture. The melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> are in the violins. And they are both playing rhythms with quavers and semiquavers. If you were going to subdivide it to make things easier to follow, they're the most important bit, and they're the ones who it would he semantically correct to give the beat. 

That makes it subdivisions of 2 or 4, but the more you subdivide it, the harder it is to correctly feel the pulse (which is still 24 *crotchets* per minute, not 48 quavers and definitely not 96 semiquavers), and going with 2 still makes it feel a very slow rhythm, while beating 4 at 96 makes it feel much faster. So 2 is the logical choice. 
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2017-01-26 22:39:41 ZoeBlade<br>Well, you *can* have many instruments playing at once, but they have to only be doing only a few *different* things.  Having only drums, a bassline, a melody, a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, a rhythm, and some harmonies at most is a good idea.  Now, if you want 30 instruments at once, you can do that, but they can't all be playing different melodies.  They should all be playing the same melody, <b><u>countermelody</u></b> etc.  So you can layer up parts, and you can double parts, and you can have lots of instruments playing at once, but only about four or so *different* phrases should be played at once.

"I want to play this <b><u>countermelody</u></b> on this synth and also this sampler" is fine.  "I want to play one <b><u>countermelody</u></b> on this synth and a different <b><u>countermelody</u></b> on this sampler" less so.

But it's hazy, and a judgement call, with no hard and fast rules.

Look up how to sidechain a 808 to a kick drum first and foremost.  In that track the kick seems nonexistent but if you sidechain the 808 to it the kick will really punch through the mix.  maybe turn down the open high hat just a tad....i'd take off the lower frequencies of the closed hats too.  melody is slightly repetitive but not in a bad way since youve got a cool <b><u>countermelody</u></b> goin on over it.  hihat patterns are pretty cool, nothing too over the top.  

overall its pretty good man.  just those few small suggestions.  they'll make a big difference in your production homie, keep up the good work.
</p></li><li><p><b>Bass</b> 2017-01-31 14:07:30 IPYF<br>The bassline is far too busy and attention-seeking in my opinion. The part you've written is aiming to be a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to the quite sparse guitars and the relatively straight vocals, which is a cool idea in theory, but unfortunately it goes beyond where it should be, becomes invasive and spends a lot of the song jousting the vocals for command of the composition. 

If this were me I'd rewrite the part, paring it right back to put the needs of the song before your needs as a player. It's quite a sweet song and it deserve to be allowed to breathe.

I know this might not be what you want to hear, but the best part I ever wrote for a song came of the back of a confrontation with my band at the time. They were like "Dude, stop trying to play a note on every beat". I got totally shit off and passive aggressively played the most simple thing I could think of to make a point. That's now my favourite part I ever wrote, and I'm glad my band brought it up. I think of it any time I'm writing a part and I get the feeling I'm trying to be too cute.

The melodies don't ever lead to a satisfying cadence at the end of the line, they just dance around in the middle of chords and never lead on another chord or key change etc. 

As for improving that, crack some <b><u>countermelody</u></b> and contrary motion in it, and watch where the end of bars lead up to.

The orchestration point I made, it's just a bit mucky, as was said above me, the brass doesn't sound natural and in it's true range. The strings sound mucky and middle heavy, poorly arranged, look into some string arrangement videos. It's not about how much time you spend on it, if you do it right first time, you'll save a lot of time in future edits!

&gt; Tom Hasslan (guitars)
Axel Skalstad (drums)
Jørgen Mathisen (saxophone)

&gt; Review by Thom Jurek

&gt; Norway is home to a number of bands that explore the connections between free jazz and hard, progressive, and avant rock. Shining, Elephant9, Bushman's Revenge, and the Hedvig Mollestad Trio are four of the best examples, yet each has its own sonic approach to composition, rhythm, and improvisation. What's more, all record for Rune Grammofon. Krokofant is the name of the Norse power trio made up of guitarist Tom Hasslan, drummer Axel Skalstad, and saxophonist Jørgen Mathisen. As evidenced by their self-titled debut, their sound is deeply influenced by the forceful jazz-rock of John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra and the early-'70s albums of guitarist Ray Russell, the angular precision of Larks' Tongues through Red-era King Crimson, the vanguard rock explorations of Henry Cow, and the free jazz skronk of Last Exit. But Krokofant add another element too: an unabashed love for prog metal. On album opener "Polyfant," one can hear the physical, mathy attack of Meshuggah. Muscular guitar riffing gives way to a head-to-head guitar and sax duel, yet each player pays heed to the forceful shifts in time and dynamic introduced by Skalstad. The razored twists and turns in the intro to "Bodega" give way to a nearly funky approach as Hasslan's riffs and the double-timed drum attack allow for an extended, imaginative solo by Mathisen and a focused guitar break that weaves jazz chords, arpeggios, and finally six-string metallic histrionics amid a furious rhythmic syncopation. In "Thispair," Mathisen's tenor sax initially offers a dolorous yet lyric melody framed by Hasslan's slow contrapuntal accompaniment, illustrated and developed by Skalstad. The saxophonist and drummer move into free terrain rather quickly, pushing against the margins of the guitarist's consistent <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, creating nearly cinematic drama. The 13-minute closer, "Castaway," commences as an atmospheric jazz exercise with crystalline guitar, shimmering cymbal flecks, and wafting low-register tenor lines that reflect post-Coltrane modalism. It floats along, with some breezy turns and shapes, until hard surfaces are reintroduced and the piece gets freer, more focused on what lies inside the improvisational dialogue. It's a stirring finish. Krokofant's riveting debut offers an exciting aural portrait of a band that already plays like a much more experienced ensemble.

I don't have any experience with orchestration, so I'm looking for ways to improve it. I think it's good for my first attempt at arranging a concert band piece. I did a four part harmony to start with, then transcribed it into the score, then added a few embellishments like the french horn <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the middle section and the progression at the end.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2017-02-22 12:14:39 jthanson<br>I like it very much.  The french horn counter melody is an especially nice touch for a section of that piece which frequently gets forgotten about.  If you are looking for ways to enrich the piece further you could put a few more harmonic suspensions in that <b><u>countermelody</u></b> section.  I don't think any additional suspensions would detract from the piece.  Overall I think you've done a very nice and very interesting version of our national anthem.
</p></li><li><p><b>popheads</b> 2017-02-27 02:42:27 Dammit-Hannah<br>The chorus is definitely catchy, but that <b><u>countermelody</u></b> toward the end is even more so.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-02-28 10:18:30 idea_roux<br>Personally I whistle most of my "central" melodies and then transpose that to guitar. Then compose around it as necessary and swap in and out chords via the circle of fifths until I get what im looking for. At that point, it's just arrangement and <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, which will just be to your/your song's taste. Maybe use the relative minor/major key to explore new movements in the track that counter the initial main riff.

Hope that helps some, it works for me when I find myself having writer's block.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-03-01 00:05:15 gopher9<br>There's a lot of simple ways to break your pattern. For example:

1. Choose *any* three seventh chords you like and write a melody having ii-V-I progression in mind (don't start it with the tonic). 

2. Write a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to that melody. Don't think about scales or chords, there are [simple rules](https://music.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-contemporary-musicians-guide-to-counterpoint--audio-4630).

Or you can:

1. Read some Hindemith and write a tonal piece that is neither major nor minor

Also you can:

1. Write some atonal or post-tonal piece

Or:

1. Use techniques of minimalism

Or, if you feel adventurous:

1. Write a microtonal piece in 31 tone equal temperament

I dig ur track too! it has great harmonic texture, which is sick for this style of beat. i definitely could see someone with a laidback flow like isaiah rashad utilize a lot of the tension that the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> builds to make a really powerful song... but i could also see like wiz khalifa on it just go dumb. solid mixing too, my only thing is maybe turn up the kick and pitch down the hihat, but thats more a matter of taste. awesome work. 5 starz

49: Alm Map 1 probably wins because of the accented high strings in the A part and the sort of <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the second B part.  Those sound way dope.

50: Bearer of Hope.  I could probably go either way, but I went with this one for its tempo and that little horn part in the middle

51: Lion King Eldigan wins barely by being such a pleasant song.  Without being too complex, it manages to do quite a lot

52: Final Map.  Id Purpose is a weird one for me.  I like the second part, the first part doesn't quite do it for me, whereas Final Map is good the whole way through

</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2017-03-20 04:20:44 JohannYellowdog<br>There's one chord that I liked in here - a dissonance or false relation of some sort at 0:58 (repeated at 1:24, and again at 1:31, though I think it would have been stronger if you hadn't). That chord, I thought, could have grown into something unique and interesting. The rest of the clip didn't measure up, I'm afraid; it was too foursquare for my tastes, and always in the same pattern. 

This style of film composition that's fashionable right now, always in slow tempi, with very simple chord progressions, doesn't do much for me. I think Zimmer does it well, along with a couple of other composers, but there are dozens of other composers who use the same techniques and create nothing memorable with them. Please don't become another one. I'm sure you've got your own voice. 

EDIT to add technical criticism: I could compare your clip to the theme from The Pacific. Both themes use the same "chord, chord, chooord" pattern (2 beats, 2 beats, 4 beats). But in HBO's score, that 4 beat chord is always kept active by something - a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, a resolving dissonance, something. In your clip, the 4 beats are just held, static, every time, and the energy sags. Then, because the music is so regular in its construction, I start anticipating all of these moments. It's too predictable.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-03-23 10:03:00 xiipaoc<br>Solo: one person alone doing interesting stuff.  Usually it requires other people to stop doing interesting stuff for a bit so that the soloist's interesting stuff stands out.  In vocal music, a solo is something sung by just one person as opposed to multiple people in the group.  In a rock context, we usually talk about solos for the non-vocalists because the vocalist is pretty much *always* singing solo.  So, for example, a guitar solo is when the vocalist shuts up and the guitar plays the interesting stuff, and a drum solo is when the drummer stops doing the basic beat and does something cooler for a while.

Melody: a single, important line.  There are many things going on at the same time in a piece of music.  If there's one instrument (or vocalist) that is playing one note at a time and that's important, it's a melody.  Usually, the melody is the most important thing in a song.  If you sing something, you sing the melody.  But you can have less important melodies too.  The important thing is that it's a single line -- that is, one note at a time.  If there's a second note, that second note is not part of the melody (though it may be part of a different melody).  If there's a main melody and another less important melody at the same time, that second one is a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.  Melodies should also make sense.  You should usually be able to sing the melody (and you should usually *want* to, if it's a good melody).  If it's not really singable, it's not really a melody (as a rough guide).

Lick/riff: some technically interesting part of something.  Often it's a complicated part of the melody that's hard to play, with lots of fast notes, but it doesn't really have to be.  If you're talking about "this lick", you're probably talking about a particular run or little gesture or whatever; it's usually easy to tell between the lick you're talking about and whatever you aren't talking about.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-03-25 00:26:29 ljse7m<br>Under Control is a very loose example of harmony as a melody. It is more like a progression with the melody on top in a homophonic texture, in this case a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> with chords under the higher voice of the harmony. This one seems at least somewhat functional and I could tell more if I could hear the vocal track that has the main melody. It doesn't come through on my computer. 

This is not an example of Planing BUT harmony can be moved parallel to simulate a melody. That makes it difficult to understand the two mindsets you are talking about. 

I suspect that if I could hear it that the melody of the vocal would possibly be a contrapuntal line that is harmonized by the chords played weather functional or not. Maybe that is what you are talking about. 

Chords themselves are not melodic unless you consider diatonic or chromatic planing as a high texture melodic line which it certainly be in some cases. And as I said, you can have more than one melody and each melody can be harmonized and it is still counterpoint although it is counterpoint combined with harmonnic reinforcement. 

As to your last assumption, you and your listening friends may perceive chords as melodies but it is more likely that you are listening to the higher or more prominent voice of the chord progression as a melody and it is, but if that is the case, it is not the harmony that is the melody, it is that prominent voice that is the melody and the rest is harmony for that voice. 

when there is one note of melody harmonized by one chord and they have the same melodic and harmonic rhythm, it tends to sound like the harmony is the melody but in reality, unless everything is moving in parallel motion (all the voices of the harmony) it is MUCH more likely that it is just a melody harmonized with the same rhythm as the harmony.

</p></li><li><p><b>grateful_dead</b> 2017-04-01 04:35:04 MrCompletely<br>I'm always interested to hear what people think about this tour. I was lucky enough to do all of East Coast Summer and Fall 89 and Spring 90 and more scattered stuff on the west coast around that, then a good chunk but not all of Summer 90. This was exactly the era when I had my shit together enough financially to string together long runs of shows and wasn't too burned out/jaded to do it - the music made it worthwhile. After the relative boredom of '88 and before the much more mixed bag of the Bruce era it was a really lucky opportunity.

I do agree Spring 90 was a peak of some kind. The band was very tight and playing with intent and fire. There's no doubt the overall performance level was tighter in Spring 90 than Fall 89 for example. But to give a couple counter arguments, kind of a (friend of the) devil's advocate thing:

 - One Dark Star, really? Damn Jer dawg that's pretty stingy

 - Man, that's a lot of Picasso Moon and I Will Take You Home. You're right about the latter tune. One of the heaviest dickpunches ever.

 - without Dark Stars, how much real jamming is there? Like 4 segments pre drums, right? 2 out of Terrapins, one out of Women, one out of Eyes, maybe one more kinda half-assed one, almost all from the first half of tour. That's not nothing and it's all pretty good stuff but it's something we noticed at the time as a lack.

 - the Black Throated Wind bustout with altered lyrics is one of the greatest unintentional-comedy Bobby faceplants in the history of the band. Good god those changes are terrible. At first we were horrified, then by the end we were crying with laughter

But those are tour-kid gripes, the kind of things that only matter if you're seeing every show. I don't disagree with the assessment of it as a great tour, but personally I'll take the 3 Dark Stars of Fall and the sloppiness that went with it.

Overall the upsides outweigh the down by a long way though. To comment on a few of your specific points:

 - note the WAN H&gt;S&gt;F has fairly heavy overdubs. Compare it to the box set version and you'll hear what I mean, the real version isn't nearly as clean. It's good, but really there isn't an 89-90 version that's totally tight.

 - it would be pretty hard argue against 3.24 or 3.29 on any level. Peak shows. 3.15 not quite at that level for me but still very good

 - Agreed the Omni run is the underrated segment of tour because most of the Northeast &amp; Midwest kids didn't make the trip

 - Most versions of Estimated from this era where Bobby doesn't lose his mind too hard during the shouty part are great, yeah. But he usually does

 - I'm a huge fan of LLR (again, when Bob doesn't get too stupid) and the FX don't bother me that much - for me it's all about the Jerry <b><u>countermelody</u></b> soloing in the back third of the song. And these versions are some of the best for that. I think the Omni LLR actually exceeds the WAN one.

</p></li><li><p><b>beatles</b> 2017-04-08 03:33:07 bill_from_atlantis<br>So it was George and Paul who played the harmonized lead part? Does anyone know who played which part? I enjoy how complex this solo and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> is, and you can really hear it shine because of John's restraint as a rhythm player- he's just strumming quarter notes so as not to get in the way. 

I think it was around this middle period (Help-Revolver) were Paul started to become more of a guitar player in the group, which is crazy; his bass part is already so great. A lot of creativity flowing from him at this point, and not even on his own songs.

I also heard somewhere that the lyric "you say you've seen 7 wonders" was in reference to Paul when he first tried pot ("there are 7 levels.."). That main concept of *you don't get me* was supposed to be about the changing drug dynamic of the group, with Paul being the odd (relatively straight) man out. And yet he sings in perfect harmony these lyrics that might've been about him.

So this is a full orchestra, probably more commonly what is known as a 'modern romantic orchestra'. Typically orchestras like this are built of different instrument families: Woodwinds, Brass, Percussion, Harp/Keyboards, and Strings.

A typical woodwind section consists of Flutes, Oboes, Clarinets, and Bassoons. It's hard to me to tell by ear, but the woodwinds I hear most prominently in this piece are flutes. The line that goes up and down around 0:53 is played by a flute. 

The brass usually consists of French Horns (which are now referred to as just 'Horns'), Trumpets, Trombones, and Tubas. The main theme you hear when this thing starts is probably on Horns, doubled by some of the lower strings. (It might be trumpets or bones, this sounds like a synthy orchestra and I can't make it all out.)

The strings make up the bulk of the orchestra. They're comprised of Violins, Violas, Cellos, and Double Basses. The cellos have the offbeat <b><u>countermelody</u></b> you're hearing at the beginning. The strings are playing most of the driving music you hear throughout.

Percussionwise I hear cymbals (the swooshy sound), an anvil (the clank), bass drum (the boom), and a snare drum (and the military sounding drum).

There's also a choir (or a synthesized one) singing on top of everything.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2017-04-25 16:20:40 Barcelona_City_Hobo<br>Actually, most nocturnes, like those of Chopin, are laid out in ternary form. Moreover, one or both subsections are many times laid out in binary or ternary form. 

Another feature is that when melodies are repeated (somethign that binary and ternary forms feature), they usually undergo variation and embelleshing, each repetition being more elaborate.

&gt;The only real "requirement" for something to be called a Nocturne is that it's evocative of the night

What does that even mean? The violent restatement of the first theme in Chopin's nocturne Op.41/1 doesn't sound "nocturnal" to me, but it follows the formal characteristics I outlined.

Another feature is (usually) a moderate tempo (fir the first section, it can however be accelerated), and a rather simple texture of melody plus accompainment. The left hand almost always plays chords or arpeggios. If there's a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, it's not very long and may be played by the right hand, too.
</p></li><li><p><b>Songwriters</b> 2017-04-25 16:45:18 vizionheiry<br>Make some decisions away from the DAW. Take your most complete set of lyrics.  Choose a mode and key.  Start with C Major.  Then choose a tempo. Let's say 120 bpm.  Next choose a genre. Let's choose pop.  Then choose a chord progression.  Let's choose a basic I-IV-V.  

So now you have the lyrics, mode, key, tempo, genre and chord progression.  C Major | 120 bpm | Pop | I-IV-V

Now start playing the chord progression over and over.  Then start singing the words to your chorus.  Change around the chords a bit for the verse VI-I-V-I6.  Start singing again. Now you have your verse and chorus.  Do the same lil switcheroo with a bridge or prechorus.  

Now, go to your DAW. Make sure you have a template track arranged with section markers for the intro, verse, chorus, and other parts of the song.  Then lay down the chord progressions to a click track.  Record your vocal melody of the lyrics.  Add more developed drums.  

Then add any other synths that you want to embellish and add color.  Consider adding a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> here, a drum variataion there.  Voila! Song.

The other thing is, realest of real talks, I don't know if the vocal is strong enough to carry the track as the center of focus during the last half. It's a good musical idea, but i find myself craving just a liiiiittle bit more musical activity, bar to bar, and then also something that slowly builds towards the end. I dig that you're creating a very ambient track, and I think that the balance between creating that repetition and also still having interesting musical ideas. and again, that synth line - could listen to that all day. 

came up with a couple ideas, but y'know take em with a grain of salt. 

- maybe keep the vox, but bring it down the mix, or

- bring in a louder, more active bassline to act as counter point in the second half of the track

- you could also gradually open up the filter cutoff and ADSR release on the synth as you build towards the end of the track. 

- You might think about a counter melody too - straight out of the old school deadmau5 playbook. [Animal Rights,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBp9mNOFDLk) [Strobe,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKi9Z-f6qX4) [vanishing points-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkDy_m21BEM&amp;spfreload=10) they all work by introduction riff 1, adding drums and riding that to a breakdown where a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> is introduced.

</p></li><li><p><b>explainlikeimfive</b> 2017-05-01 23:06:12 autistictanks<br>A riff is a melody, 

It's not a chord progression.

When you write a melody over a riff, you are creating a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. 

A riff is a melodic progression rather than a harmonic one, however when the two are combined, you create implied harmony.

Just in case anybody's wondering why Ode to Joy is playing as our fight song, a small part of it is played as a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in longer versions of All Right Now.  Ole, ole, ole is also inserted sometimes.  

Horizon High School, the band that filled in for the LSJUMB in the Sun Bowl, must have also come away enamored with that brief Ode to Joy section because they played it every time they performed All Right Now for the Sun Bowl crowd.

The breakdown is kind of strange though, I like that you have a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> going in the background but the two lines kind of clash with each other a bit imo. I'd lower the 2nd one a bit or simplify it, complex melodies aren't always the way to go, especially in trance music.

Nothing spectacular, but solid.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b> 2017-05-03 10:43:10 Zagorath<br>This is a pretty easy choice, really. As important as it is historically, the 3rd just isn't quite the same level as the 5th.

The 5th is basically a perfect symphony. The first movement builds a near perfect example of the Sonata Form from the simplest motif possible. Its two themes show a brilliant contrast between the darkness and the light, and the change from horn to bassoon in the announcement of the second theme during the recapitulation is one of the most brilliantly considered choices out there. Not to mention the awesomeness of the bassoon <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the first theme of the recapitulation. And the incredible oboe solo, and its piercing long notes in the 13 or so bars right after it.

Then the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th movements all manage to in some way incorporate that same main motif, something so rarely done at all, and never done to quite the same extent and effectiveness as Beethoven achieves here.

The attacca from the third to fourth movements, and latter the reoccurrence of the third movement's motif within the fourth movement, are some of the most chilling moments in the classical literature.

The third symphony might have expanded the horn section a little, but the fifth is basically responsible for popularising the use of piccolo and trombone in symphonic music.

So yeah, for me this is an incredibly obvious choice. The third symphony is the third best.

I found the main melody to be a bit 'front heavy', meaning that the way it continually hits hard for a bar and then has a bar rest was a bit lumbering, or halting. It didn't bother me in the first half of the track but by the end it's repeated enough without any development it felt pretty unbalanced. You could have a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> keeping things rolling in that second-of-every-two bars, or look at developing that melody to make it a bit more... melodic, or flowing or something.

The countermelodies, harmonies, textures, and timbre are way more diversified in *Dragonsong*. If anything it is *Dragonsong* that is repetitive with its bland and predictable harmonies.

Just in *Revolutions* alone you have a contrast between the 'light' string segments, the 'strong' brass segments, the 'light-hearted' string/harp/triangle segments, and the 'hopeful' but short woodwind leading into brass segments. You can't find any of this timbre transition/contrast in *Dragonsong*, it's just piano -&gt; strings -&gt; strings -&gt; strings ... ad infinitum.

The <b><u>countermelody</u></b> is also so much more complex and beautiful in this piece, every part of the orchestra is used effectively to evoke a specific mood and colour, and you have different instruments leading off each other.

I seriously can't think *Revolutions* is in any way a less complex and worse piece than *Dragonsong*.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-05-19 12:00:02 ljse7m<br>Sounds like what I would call "parameters" as I see that as being layers of simple concepts layered over each other. But I don't get this from Schenker, its just how music is put together. 

I have never really understood how what I could glean from Schenker is anything but restating the obvious. Kodaly organizes his view of the concepts that define music into about 5 basic elements (depending upon how you want to count them) and these 5 elements are all very simple in theory, but become more complicated as one explores their various applications and combines them simultaneously creating multiple and layers of simple things to shape a more composite, seemingly complex whole until you sort them out. 

The thing is, when you try to do a "visual" analysis of these elements, the analysis becomes more complex than the music itself.  For example, if you start with a simple melody like even Twinkle Twinkle, you have one layer of the succession of notes with their rise and fall. Lets consider that one dimension. Then you overlay a rhythmic pattern and you have another dimension. If you then take the resulting or added harmonic pattern, you are getting into three dimensions. Now, when doing a visual, we start to have a problem. We are at the edge of what can be visualized in a two dimensional representation like a diagram. But we still only have a simple one line melody, with an underlying simple chordal pattern, and a time element of how these three (?) elements are combined. But upon analysis, there are various ways the melody and harmony. 

The melody however follows a pattern described as form and the way the motifs are combined create another "dimension" to distinguish it from another song using the same notes but there are simple shapes formed by these motifs that are undulating over the rhythm of the chord progression and if you happen to add a counter melody by giving a melodic shape to the bass line instead of just roots, the combination which is now, depending upon how you have been counting has progressed to at least four dimensions and possibly five or more and with the new <b><u>countermelody</u></b> of the bass interacting with the other elements we have several other things happening that has to be visualized in the diagram. We now have exponential progressions of concepts that need to be visualized. 

This is of course an extreme oversimplification but it is still a very simple song being complex before the addition of the secondary melody and then we now have more dimensions than we can meaningfully express with a diagram! 

But we basically have Twinkle Twinkle with a melodic bass line. 

If you try to put all of this into a diagram or a simplified score like visual representation, it gets more complicated than it needs to be but  that is what I get out of Schenker. Its simply more complicated way of trying to put too much information into ONE visual representation when a simple narrative to describe what a trained musician or theorist hears as a simple melody, with a simple chord progression and a bass line other than the roots. 

The only reason I added the melodic bass line is to give that unique element that seems to be necessary in a Schenker analysis and a chord progression with roots in the bass helps to show how the element of harmony can be just the chords OR can be two elements of the analysis with just that same simple variation of one of the previous elements and how even a simple chord progression can be made to be more complex as it adds the contrapuntal aspect to the mix. 

So this is the problem. Its not really possible to illustrate all of the elements that make the musical piece what it is. Even the simplest of musical pieces like Twinkle becomes difficult of impossible to give complete representation of what is there. That is why in a traditional analysis, there is a "narrative". After the appropriate analytical method is applied to the particular genre or style of the composition, a narrative is compiled to explain what unique applications of the composition contribute to his artistic merit. 

Schenker illustrations can be well done or not. I have tried to find another way of looking at Schenker but so far to no avail. To me, Schenker is more of a visual arts presentation of a traditional analysis and if you take away the visual aspect of Schenker, we are left with the traditional narrative part of analysis without the appropriate theory to match the music involved. 

He seems to be focused even in the narrative to want to paint a picture of what makes the piece what it is. I would hope that someone can tell me what I am missing with this assessment of Schenker. I do not proport to be an expert of his style of analysis but that is because to me, it seems to be dependent on using the traditional styles of analysis as a prerequisite for doing the visual aspect and I just find that too subjective to be of any real use no matter how beautiful it is. I don't think that he is irrelevant, just redundant. 

I think your narrative description is AT LEST as good or better than any that I have heard, but still, I don't see much that actually tells me how to create an artistic composition using the end result of the visual or computer generated representation of the music after it is created. 

Do you have any ideas of hot to Back Out of the abstract computational process to tell me how to create a composition? I still find that the concept of overlying parameters, each being depicted in musical contexts is something I can use to plan a composition in a much more pragmatic manner. I also think that we may be saying a lot of the same thing in different manner in a lot of ways although I don't see the "parameter" aspect to be separated in your short post. That, however would be asking a lot from a rather short reddit post 

Thanks for sharing you views on Schenker. It almost sounds like there is something to it! lol I do tend to emphasize the pragmatic aspect of musical theory and that is what I see missing still in this post. Maybe you will be able to point how Schenker can be used by the composer or improvisor where so many others have failed.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2017-05-22 01:32:23 silentedge92<br>I think you're approaching orchestration from a wrong perspective, ergo, you're trying to make things complex to make them sound impressive, but that's not how it works.

What I meant in the video is: ideally, to have a rich orchestration, every instrument in your orchestration must bring something to the table.

It's hard to phrase it in words with no audio example, but here's a simple example:
You can make brass and strings play the same melody, or make them play a chord together, but a nice way of doing it would be to arrange that melody or chord voicing differently on each section, using different articulations / dynamics changes / slightly different rhythms etc.

Or if you want, you could have a melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b> going on at the same time, so two different melodies, but write them in such a way that they follow the same accents in terms of rhythm.

As long as you arrange your orchestral instruments in a way that they're different, but still tied by a few common elements (rhythm, call &amp; response phrases, melody, harmony, accents etc.), the arrangement is not likely to sound chaotic. 

Ideally you want to chain up every instrument to at least another in that way.
Simply layering stuff  on different octaves is also great, but shouldn't be abused.

Anyway, these are very simplistic examples of orchestration and you'll figure out other ways to arrange once you get more expert, but starting simple is actually one of the best ways to go into this without getting lost.

Many times I had to pick really on subtleties to give a ranking for everyone, and in most cases the only thing to make the difference was which song I would personally more dance to (read: adherence to the theme). So a 15th place does not mean the quality of the song was bad by any means.

::AUDIO BALLOT BEGINS HERE:: subversiveasset&gt;Agustín Rios&gt;VideoGamesG33k&gt;Cookie&gt;PrjzCalavera&gt;Orchestral Fantasy&gt;Soundole VGM&gt;SlashBib&gt;Adam Matlock&gt;psycosulu&gt;Xeno sound &gt;Red Bearded Viking&gt;Henski ::AUDIO BALLOT ENDS HERE::

SlashBib: Very nice to listen to, the rhythm is very driving. Also very nice choice of sounds, fits perfectly

Henski: I like the idea and the sound you’re going for, but it feels like the piece is missing something, the instrumentation is a bit static and I think it affects the engagement. Also I found the chip-like <b><u>countermelody</u></b> a bit distracting and maybe a bit harsh in the mix.

Red Bearded Viking: Not 100% sure of the fit of he song choice, but in any case it is enjoyable and flows nicely altogether in its parts. Only thing I’d say is that the guitars are maybe a bit muffled in the overall mix

Agustín Rios: Straight outta the 50’s with a super danceable tune! Good job

PrjzCalavera: I shouldn’t love this, but I do. 

Orchestral Fantasy: This is so happy! I really like the arrangement, it is very particular, good job :)

Soundole VGM: Very interesting choice of song

VideoGamesG33k: Dat groove man, so good

Team Friesen FTW: Soothing, nice and danceable, nothing to say

psycosulu: I loved the acid synths, imma rave

subversiveasset: Y U SO GOOD. STAHP. The sax works perfectly even though I’m pretty sure it shouldn’t but the real thing here is all the details in the mix, they really step up the production value

Xeno sound: Very danceable as well, not a fan of the abrupt pause in the middle but that’s just my taste

Cookie: Very sweet, I really like how the voices almost give a trance/hypnotic feel to it

Dacian Grada: Tunz tunz tunz tunz. Catchy and tunzy

Adam Matlock: I really loved your pick the beginning part with choir, but as when the piano stepped in… the magic was gone. I want to clarify here that I’m not saying the piano part was bad or anything, only that (imo) it didn’t fit the ritual feel at all. Nonetheless I really enjoyed your cover, I just have to find reasons to rank some over others :/

Joe Bin: Nice and catchy, curious to see you expanding your synth palette

&gt;The song is in the key of E and is in 4/4 time during the verse, chorus and bridge, but changes to 5/4 in the pick-up to the verse.[3] It grew (like "Sun King") from the F♯m7- E changes from Fleetwood Mac's "Albatross" ("like she does" [F♯m7] "yes she does" [A, Am] "yes she does" [E]) with McCartney arranging instrumental and vocal parts and Harrison adding a descending two-part lead guitar accompaniment to the verse and a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the bridge.[4] Pollack states that "the counterpoint melody played in octaves during the Alternate Verse by the bass and lead guitars is one of the more novel, unusual instrumental touches you'll find anywhere in the Beatles catalogue."[5]

This line is pretty much unique to this take, I don't think I've ever heard it on any demos of this song. [Also, here's the lyric sheet in my music program that also confirms what John says.](http://i.imgur.com/ktHnvZU.png)

Make it a lot less repetitive - Use variations like

- doubling up the melody by using 2 or 3 different synths instead of one, this can be done on the chorus for instance

- Adding a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>

- Adding a key change


Your mixing can use a lot of work, But that will come with time

Add low-pass filters to your bass, especially thicker ones, to give it that boomy sub feel, as well as allowing it to actually sit at the low end so it doesn't clash with your lead

You should also use reverb, lowpass filters or sometimes delay to create a "wall of sound" that will fill up the empty space in the background.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-05-31 10:23:44 xiipaoc<br>A couple of things.  First, you shouldn't have too many things going on at once, period.  And if you do have multiple things going on at once, try your hardest to make sure they don't run into each other.  This means, for example, that you can have a melody in some high octave, a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> an octave lower, maybe some filler stuff the octave below that, maybe another <b><u>countermelody</u></b> an octave below, a bass part an octave below that, etc.  It's also useful if you keep things segregated by sound, so, for example, use thin metallic sounds up top, round brassy sounds in the middle, a fat bass, etc.  Try not to have too many different rhythms that don't fit together, also.  It's not a sin to have different sounds doing roughly the same thing.  Like, for example, if you have an electric piano sound doing some mid-range triad chords, you could always add a higher note to those chords in a different sound *in the same rhythm*, but softly so that it doesn't overwhelm.

The more different things you have going on, the muddier things will be.  If you want a clean sound, use less, not more.

And if you really want to learn about this, listen to 20th century orchestra composers (especially if they know how to write for wind orchestra) and study their scores.  Before the 20th century, people didn't yet have a grasp on orchestral color; the first violins just did everything.  But look at some more modern stuff so that you can get a good sense for how the different threads come together.

I low key want a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, though I don't know where it could be. A pad is always nice. Maybe switch out the kick for a long 808 for a segment. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2017-06-03 02:22:56 yogononium<br>It is difficult.
To do it like Bach you need to learn the 'rules' that govern how things work. For instance, you need to learn which intervals are consonant, which are dissonant, and learn about writing a good melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. 

There's a book called Gradus ad Parnassum by Johann Fux that outlines the basic steps to learning counterpoint, one step at at a time. 

Best is to start with 2 voices and then add more in as you gain familiarity. 

</p></li><li><p><b>LetsTalkMusic</b> 2017-06-08 21:38:54 TheRingshifter<br>Nah, I think you're talking a load of old rubbish mate.

Firstly, that SNES track is nice, but calling that base bit a "<b><u>countermelody</u></b>" is a bit of a stretch IMO. I mean, here's a simple exercise: try humming it. OK yeah, you can, but it's not really a "melody" in the colloquial and obvious sense. It couldn't really be the hook to a nice chorus. It's really just a nice bass figure outlining (if I'm not mistaken - I haven't gone and transcribed it) the chords of the song. 

Secondly, we live in the age of complete abundance. Somewhere there is the music that is exactly what you are looking for. However, there is SOME truth to the idea. Using multiple melodies at the same time is WAY less common now than it was in, say, the 17th Century, where Bach and other Baroque composers were the masters of this. But finding examples equal to the one you poster is almost trivial IMO - just something with a strong groove / bass figure. 

Thirdly, if this is supposed to be a criticisim of game music in particular, I think there's loads of great game music currently as well, such as the Super Hexagon soundtrack (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jigRSeRYMzA), which I think could actually make sounder claims to containing melodies and countermelodies (4:31 has a bunch of melodic ideas swirling around, as does 6:11), or the brilliant Spelunky soundtrack (https://phlogiston.bandcamp.com/album/spelunky) and many more.

Countermelodies are still pretty damn rare, but they have been since pretty much the late 19th Century if we are going to be fair. The other elements of classical composition your quotee notes as being dismissed are all completely present and accounted for, in my opinion. Not in *every* song, of course - which is good, IMO. It means we have a more varied song world than we have had in the past.

He has a delay on the whole time. the delay is set to repeat once every 5 16th notes. so 1 e + a 2 **e** + a 3 e **+** a 4 e + a. you need to use a delay with tap tempo to achieve this. He alternates between simple mirroring of thom's rhythms (in the intro, and during the G- and C- chords in the verses), and playing offbeat 16th note arpeggios (during the Eb and D- chords in the verses). 
 Starting at the chorus, he tremolo picks a single note <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. this continues for the rest of the song. Theres one melody for the chorus that he plays all 4 times pretty much verbatim,  and then theres another melody that he plays during the bridge that he repeats twice, the second time starts an octave higher. he turns on a reverb for that section. thats basically the whole song.

It sounds like you have a melody and a bassline. Do you have chords (accompaniment)? Pads, strings, arps, guitar or piano chords can work nicely for this. Do you have a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> - something that responds to your melody? 
</p></li><li><p><b>AceAttorney</b> 2017-06-21 21:36:21 TsundereKermit<br>I generally don't just look at the themes themselves, but how they fit in the context of their own game, and because we're talking about AA music, it should go without saying that pretty much every track is enjoyable. I think AJ's cross examination is a good theme, but it shouldn't be used in say, DD for example. 

**Moderato:**

 1) Dual Destinies - It matches a lot of different moods, and I'm a huge fan of the instrumentation. 

 2) AJ - Another one I didn't really care for at first, but it slowly grew into one of my favorites.

 3) PW:AA - I actually really didn't like this one the first time I played PW, but it grew on me when I started hearing other ones. 

 4) JFA- Not bad, but I still found it enjoyable.
 
 5) Spirit of Justice - Still a good track, but I just  but I just happen to prefer the other songs a bit more.

 6) T&amp;T - Enjoyable, but I feel gets old after a bit. 

**Allegro:**

 1) Dual Destinies - This song still has never gotten old for me. They're pretty good about holding off on using it until it really counts, and like the moderato version, it just captures so many different moods for me. 

 2) Spirit of Justice - It has a very similar baseline to DD and a lot of really memorable parts to it. The <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in it is great as well. I only took music theory for a year, so I'm no pro at it, but this song brought back a lot of memories from some of the stuff I learned from it, which was more just an extra bonus.

 3) PW:AA - Pretty much a classic and always the go to "Get pumped" track.

 4) JFA - One I feel really matches the tension of a lot of the bigger cases at the end. 

 5) T&amp;T - I still love this one, but it's just that the others are still great. It's really more the pursuit and cornered themes that stick out for me with T&amp;T.

 6)  AJ - Again, another one I love. It might rank last, but allegro themes pretty much never let me down. It's also noteworthy that it doesn't have key change from the jump from moderato to allegro. I think the First PW cross examination does that too, but I have to hear it again to remember.

I got a hint of some 808, but it was like cut off after being there for a very short time, sounds intentional. I would like a more present 808 for the drop, and keep that short one for the chorus.

</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b> 2017-07-05 11:34:27 iaintmadaboutit<br>There's already some good advice in here but I'll throw mine in anyway. There's nothing inherently wrong with what you were doing with the LH here, but there are definitely ways you can expand to make the composition more interesting and build as it develops. I think it starts off great with the more minimalistic accompaniment you already have, so maybe try adding syncopation by way of playing just the root in octaves then playing the chord on the 'and' of beat 2. You could also arpeggiate the chord by doing a roll (root, fifth, third quickly) on the second chord (Bb) of the figure after playing the syncopated triad. An ascending arpeggio playing 1/8 notes would also be great, especially if you add in the 9th scale degree in passing (I personally would use  9ths and add2 chords - i.e. C, D, E, G all played at once - all over this!). 

Another thing you could try that would really make this great is to add a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in the left hand during the space you leave in the main melody. Also try playing a descending line along with the melody that connects the two changes. This counter movement will go a long way to adding interest to the melody. One more suggestion is to add a broken triad accompaniment in the LH by playing something like 1-5-3-5 with the melody (listen to Come Sail Away by Styx for an example of this). 

Apologies if any of this sounds a little ambiguous. If I get a chance to record some examples I could do that if you are interested. 

TL/DR: add syncopation to left hand by placing chords in the spaces between the melody, LH rolls, slow arpeggios (add 9!), counter melodies in the spaces left by the main melody, counter melodies moving in opposing directions, broken triad figures

What's so ridiculous about saying EBBTG was is the strongest release of the year, musically? Not that I'd agree, but it was an album that was much more interested in 'musicality' than most other hip-hop releases - by which I mean things like thoughtful song structures, composing melody/<b><u>countermelody</u></b>/harmony, exploring ideas from outside genres, experimenting with different voices. Plus, I agree that it did a great job melding pop sensibilities with thug's eccentricity without sacrificing catchiness or uniqueness. 

This isn't to convince anybody that EBBTG is the best album of the year - just saying everybody disregarding this isn't giving the album a fair shake, I think.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2017-07-09 00:59:35 hippomancy<br>That's a cool place to draw inspiration from! I like where this is going a lot.

First, you use a lot of long notes and block chords to accompany your melody. This may be what you're aesthetically going for, but for me it's a little boring. Instead of just voicing the chord you think goes with the bar of melody, implying that chord with a drone or <b><u>countermelody</u></b> is a lot more interesting to listen to. Also on that point, don't think that you need a lot of distinct parts to build up a thick texture--don't be afraid of doubling/doubling at the octave!

Second, I get the sense you want the piece to feel kind of murky and floaty. A good way to do that is to avoid cadences, fixed-length phrases and resolution altogether. Changing mode mid-phrase, avoiding the tonic and having melodies and musical ideas overlap rather than be separated by long last notes also helps.

Third, you don't make as much use of chromaticism through the first 2/3 of the piece, then introduce it as a conflicting element in the last third. While I like this use of pitch set complexity as a narrative element, you can definitely use modulation or tonicization of distant keys to vary the first sections some more. Hearing the same melody over and over again in one key is boring, but hearing it in a variety of keys and voicings prevents that complacency/familiarity.
</p></li><li><p><b>trapproduction</b> 2017-07-10 14:10:47 Mahji98<br>Melodies are already tough. 

And you want 2 of them in a song? Aha 

A lot of the times, it's better to have two melodies working together rather than them both playing at the same time.

Some things that help me out:

Have one melody make a phrase, and the other "respond to it" (<b><u>countermelody</u></b>)

Condense both melodies into 1 super melody and 
switch the instrument that plays them from time to time. 

Finesse one of your melodies to have the same notes as your chords when they hit so nothing seems out of place. 

Just because there's another element that plays notes, doesn't automatically make it a melody. 

As long as the notes fit the chords, do whatever you want. 

If it's for a beat, you don't want to overwhelm the vocal. 

That's all I got, can't really give much more info without context.


</p></li><li><p><b>beatles</b> 2017-07-17 01:44:42 BeatlesRays<br>Love the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> on the anthology version, but the solo used instead is just as good.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b> 2017-07-17 09:47:47 tquackston<br>It's a matter of perspective: I'd say that most songs out now feature one chord progression throughout but either add or subtract to the harmony for every 8 or 16 bars (or 4 or 2 depending on the structure and feel of the song).

A simplified example of this: If you had a progression like Am - F - Dm - Am for 8 bars you could add the 7th or Sus2nd to all of the chords for the next 8 bars. Then when you hit the chorus you could either double the added harmony an octave above.

How you change up the progression is dependent on the style you're doing and having big chords is usually best for soul and deep house stuff.

For other styles, you can add to the harmony by letting other instruments play riffs that add new notes to the progression that are more independent and sound like separate, independent melodies. Look up things like counterpoint or just try adding another instrument that plays a melody that follows the general melodic motion lead/vocal lead.

There are also a lot of songs that just have single note riffs in the verses, often something like a big bass sound layered with a synth one octave above, and then only have a full chord progression in the choruses.

Adding more of the same harmony at every new section can also give a sense of adding energy and more harmonies, especially when adding brighter sounds on top of less bright sounds.

This is also why putting a low pass filter on a chord-playing instrument and then gradually opening it up over 8 or 16 bars works: although the technique is overused, it makes it seem as if you're listening to a chord that goes from simple to complex.

A lot of modern styles don't do well with triads and big chords so also remember that sometimes on or two notes can be better than a full chord.

It always comes down to the style you're creating.

Edit: adding effects, changing the rhythm of the groove that the (tonal) instruments are playing, or adding/subtracting something from the drum/perc section are also valid ways of adding or subtracting to a track. Sometimes doing just one of these things is enough, other times you want to combine several.

Edit 2: I realize that I was never able to find any concise theory on this when I started out doing music, so here are some old demos I created long ago that illustrate some of these techniques. The arrangements in the demos are very simple and without a lot of production/effects/processing so you should be able to follow what's going on. Most of it's not mixed properly so don't turn it up too loud. Most if it is also very diatonic which isn't really the sound of EDM right now, but the advice is still solid to me:

1. https://soundcloud.com/user-740030329/all-that-we-are/s-n6joV
This is the same 4 chords throughout.. and then not completely: The piano always plays the full chord, the "wah guitar"-like synth doesn't always plays the full chord but tries to emphasize other parts of the harmony, sometimes playing just two-note intervals of 5ths, 4ths and 3rds, sometimes a full triad. The lead synth in the chorus plays a one note melody but this also adds to the harmonic content. The bass just plays the root note of every chord and follows the piano most of the time. All of the harmonies, rhythms, and grooves are designed to follow the trajectory of the melody that is heard in the lead synth in the intro and in the chorus.

This is created to support a vocal melody so there's not really a lead synth and most of the instruments. Again, nothing more than 1 chord progression throughout but different notes are emphasized as the bass gets added. Then in the chorus, I added a more resonant, buzzy synth that plays this little riff that goes up and down. This riff can't be considered a melody since it does the same little thing over and over again without really going anywhere, just following the chords so it serves to add more harmonic content without being a chord. In the chorus, I also added this mallet/bell-like pad that goes in and out. This pad plays mostly open chords(aka chords without triads, like 5ths and 4ths, sometimes with added 7ths) and again emphasize and add to the harmony but still remaining within the same chord progression as was heard in the verse section.

This is a bit different: Still, only 1 chord progression throughout but I add chord tones at every 8 bars. It then becomes this pattern of having 8 bars with the basic chord progression and then 8 bars with the extended harmonies, over and over again. The rhythm(groove) also goes from a more stagnant one in the verses to one with more movement in the choruses. This also happens in the drums/perc.

4 .https://soundcloud.com/user-740030329/counter-melodies/s-CQFrl
This is just me experimenting with creating a "counter"-melody. Again, it's just the same chord progression throughout but it feels like something is added when the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> enters as it emphasizes parts of the chord that haven't been "in focus" in the previous section.

5. https://soundcloud.com/user-740030329/air/s-VbNaS
This is just me experimenting with adding and extending sections by layering octaves, but the same chord progression remains throughout(except for the bridge). The bass is really loud in this example so beware.

It's hard to tame an instrument that has nigh infinite sounds possible to your liking, but as with everything it boils down to practice.

 One of the most important things I've learned as a beginner is to layer different synths that have the same job on top of each other. So for chords, have like 2 synths playing pads, pan them, and have one synth playing an arp/<b><u>countermelody</u></b>/whatever. Hell,  sometimes I'll just press the randomize everything button and it spits out some noises and I base a song off of that. I'd reccomend popping by /r/synthesizers and taking a look at their wiki/FAQ

Also, synths are only a small part of what a DAW can achieve for modern music. Download a granular synth and see what you can do. Try recording stuff and overloading it with effects. Take quiet things and amplify them, and take loud things and make them quiet. Take a file of your guitar playing and chop it, shuffle it, reverse it, pitch shift it, and all around just fuck it up and see what comes out! The DAW is its own instrument that has to be learned, so as you play around and find stuff you like, it goes into your toolbox for the future, just like playing any other instrument.

In regards to motivation, my composition teacher (I'm currently in school for music composition and history, so take what I say with a grain of salt, as I doubt have my degree yet) suggests sitting down every day and working something, even if you think it's compete shit. Musically, he suggests exploring one main theme throughout the piece. Whether that means altering the key, the instruments that have the melody, etc. Most music, particularly good music, is extremely repetitive, but in a way that balances the unknown with the constant melodic line. Humans like familiar patterns, particularly with music. In relation to DAW software, this could mean changing tempo, pitch fluctuation, effects being applied over the melody, etc. Whatever you like really, as long as there's some sort of constant people can latch onto. 

Those twenty second sound bytes you've already made can likely be turned into full songs. Work on figuring out where you want the melody placed (what you want it to jump from, how you want it to change, etc) and then focus on the background flair and any <b><u>countermelody</u></b> you decide to add. I've personally found doing a rough sketch of what you want to create helps (I want a happy feeling in the middle, so I should probably have brass have a lick with a lot of perfect fourths and fifths). 

Creating music is truly enjoyable, but really difficult to figure out where to start. The most important thing to remember is to not ask yourself if you can make what you want, but rather how you would create the sound you're looking for.

A piano can play a bass line, chords, a melody, and a harmony or <b><u>countermelody</u></b> all at the same time. A guitar can do the same, though it takes a higher skill level and weird timings usually. 

A piano is designed to work well with the human voice. The middle c is within most people's vocal range, which gives a pianist to play chords below or above a vocal melody, along with harmonizing in the same range. 

Also, both instruments are mass marketed and produced, so it's very easy to get your hands on one to learn, while most other instruments aren't sold at walmart.

Used to not like electronic music around when Dubstep was at its peak. I didn't get it. A couple years later I started dabbling in FL and listening to the odd house song here and there. I heard 'Starfish' by Savant and it was so groovy. The rich, simple waveforms, the orchestration of melody and <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and just the general groove of it was so amazing. That song, and Savants other stuff, put me on the path to appreciating electronic music of any kind. 
</p></li><li><p><b>JRPG</b> 2017-07-31 03:06:12 VashTrigun78<br>As one of my favourite songs in gaming, there's just so much to this song to appreciate. The use of leitmotifs, the symbolism, the way it evolves as the fight goes on, how each piece nicely ties in to the section of the battle you're currently in, and more. And that's just the artistic side - the technical side of the song is a marvel as well. The SNES version seamlessly transitioned from one movement to the next (the GBA version sadly did not do this), not to mention the song itself is more ambitious than most songs that ever graced the Super Nintendo. It really is a marvel that Nobuo Uematsu managed to squeeze so much out of a 16-bit machine. 

Going back to what I mentioned about leitmotifs, Final Fantasy VI in general is just really good about this. Each character has a really unique and memorable song that is intrinsically tied to them and plays in many scenes the associated character takes part in. Other Final Fantasy games do this quite well, but none as well as VI (they do come really close, however!). Case in point: Kefka's theme is used as a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to a tune that can be best described as Toccata and Fugue in D Minor but with a few changes. Consider the symbolism - this plays during the third movement of the song, wherein you fight a bastardized version of Michelangelo's Pieta, but instead of Jesus Christ, you have Kefka. The symbolism is quite obvious here, and the music perfectly accompanies it.

Another noteworthy mention would be how the song itself opens with a rendition of Catastrophe, which is fitting, considering the game itself opens up with that very same song (after you start a new game, of course). Dancing Mad's also got you covered if you consider the Opening Theme the "first song" instead - the final phase of the fight opens up with that very same song. It's a nice and extremely effective way to bookend the entire game and allows the story to come full-circle.

Then there's just the song itself, taken on its own. The first movement is so moody and dramatic, and a perfect way to set up the rest of the fight. The chaos of the second movement perfectly captures Kefka's madness - not to mention that funky beat. The third movement is a nice contrast to the previous movements of the song, and effectively sets up the final phase of the fight. The fourth movement (fifth, if I go by the in-game sound test in the GBA version) is also - how you say - funky as hell, but what I love most about it is how it segues into a morose, somber organ. Those last few chords right before the song loops back into the beginning are just amazing. 

Of course, you're free to dislike it - it is both parts typical and atypical of what is considered to be good JRPG final boss music. It has the choir and the organs that so frequently occupy the genre, but they're used in such a way that it really stands out on its own and prevents itself from being generic. I read somewhere that they allowed Uematsu another full year to compose the music, and it really, *really* shows if so.

The requirements of musical form require this recapitulation to be heightened in some way in order for it to be a satisfying conclusion to the entire performance: a new <b><u>countermelody</u></b> introduced, an increase in tempo or dynamics, a change in rhythmic density.

This percussion tag after the big major chord doesn't do anything for me.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2017-08-06 02:10:30 sonicsymphonia<br>I think something that might make E really cool is if you give the percussion the hocket-style line and then have the WW's double the melody and add a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> of some kind in the horns and saxes. The saxes by themselves probably can't compete with the horns and trumpets, especially if they're unison.

I see what you meant about F, that also looks climax-y. The moving notes in the WW's might work better there after the full section at E, to give some contrast in textures.

A sus chord resolving to Bb can work really well, I would just hold on to the sus for longer, maybe like an extra measure, and then have the fermata with everyone on the last note after it's resolved. I would also suggest having the euphoniums and maybe lower clarinets helping add more bass to that chord voicing, you have a lot of 3rd and 5th but not a whole lot of root there.

I feel like the drum/percussion samples could be swapped for better quality. they seem an little flat in the mix.

now that part after is realllyy nice! like san holo vibes but kinda different less dancy but more kinda headnodding too it.  

it does feel very ambient now, i think if you get an bit more melody coming in with example an vox or an <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or something like that you could variate an bit more in arrangement. 

maybe what you could do is turn those soft saws in big supersaws that do those short burts of chords. so you'll have your melody whistle, 808, drums and those big saws to really give it an big effect. 

what are the things you're mostly working on with this song? i can still see it go an few different directions.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2017-08-10 15:56:13 Salemosophy<br>Interesting. I've never really considered myself an "elitist" because I compose most of my material in my head. It's mostly out of necessity more than ability, because if it doesn't work in my head it's more difficult to relate to. I have to be able to 'hear it' in my mind to be able to work with it in ways that are meaningful to me. I think of it more as a crutch I wish I didn't have to rely on so much. It'd be nice to just be able to sit down without having to 'imagine sound' and come up with something I enjoy hearing. 

But to answer your question about how someone like me works with material mentally, I mostly handle it in layers. Once I establish an idea I'm working with, I sort of keep it running like a click track in my brain while I focus on other aspects, like a bass line or <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. It eventually comes out fully formed. Sometimes it's so much better than I ever could have 'imagined' it being. That's the goal, anyway.

I mean, in a way you're kind of already creating multiple melodies between the bass and the higher lead sound at the beginning, so if you could add maybe another melodic layer in between those two voices I think it could really develop a lot more.  I hope that makes sense...

There's a few pretty interesting production choices in it like 808s cowbell sounds and a random bar of bongo. In almost any other context, it would sound helplessly dated but this is a firmly modern take on the 80s: Disco and New wave get seamlessly integrated into deep house and icy synthpop, sometimes all at once and sometimes in completely disparate sections.

It's incredible how much they fit into the song, but the biggest payoff for me is sticking that ridiculous and entirely brilliant chiptune-inspired synth breakdown before the song's more conventional bridge. By the time the final chorus comes around with the aforementioned synth breakdown integrated as <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, it's pretty much pure ecstasy.

It's more of a 9, but I'm gonna inflate it to a 10 because of the perfect video and the fact that's their 10th anniversary and they totally deserve it for being in the business this long.

If you like the **ba-rump!!** of funk and soul, that's bari.  It *can* play melody (*e.g.,* Gerry Mulligan), but you have to like that bari sound and play like Gerry, or it's just going to sound nasal and harsh.

Bari can go low, but not *that much* lower than tenor (roughly five half steps), and if you are inspired by Moon Hooch, stick a traffic cone in the bell!

</p></li><li><p><b>harp</b> 2017-08-30 09:23:03 SeikaHarp<br>I memorized The Moldau in roughly three days. It's pretty repetitive in certain sections. There are certain methods when it comes to memorizing music. 

My personal method is to use "repair points" and practice in blocks. Repair points are essentially markers in the music that might be several measures long or outline a musical phrase. Typically I have pedal diagrams with every repair point. Essentially I would pick any random repair point in the piece and I would need to be able to start from it with the right pedals and notes.

Additionally, I practice in sections or blocks of repair points. For example, I might practice one section, memorize it, and move on with the next section. Once I've memorized the next section, I connect it with the first section and practice until the first and second section are seamlessly memorized. I do the next section, and then start from the first again until it builds into piece. Also, I could start backwards, connect the next section, and do the same. Another method is to randomly jump to the next repair point and start from there.

Additionally, it helps me to memorize with solfege. I have perfect pitch and some what of a photographic memory, so I hear the music in my head and I can sort of picture the music as well. If applicable, I will sing the melodic line or the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> in my head when I practice. If I really need to understand the theory of the music, I will typically reinforce my memory by analyzing the piece and writing out the harmonies. 

One other thing I do is mental practice. This is done away from the harp with just the music in front of me, or not at all. I sort of "air harp" it with my fingers, and rehearse my pedals or verbally acknowledge the key signatures of the repair points.

Muscle memory is really nice to have and comes with repetition, but it might not be reliable under stress or in a performance. All of these methods are just reinforcements and more precise than muscle memory in my opinion. I am a classical trained harpist for 20 years. I have competed in competitions needing more than 10 large pieces memorized and performed in hour long recitals, also requiring memory. Feel free to ask any questions if you have any. :)

In regards to gear, thank you for the DAW recommendation.

While the magical process generally follows a three step process (gather power, mold power via ritual, release of phenomenon), this model is a gross oversimplification of what a magician must do to produce a magical phenomenon.

In effort to make a the complexity of magic understandable for the non-magician, 13th Century Musician and Magician Walther von der Vogelweider once penned the following analogy:

*Imagine having to learn how to play “Nuits Occitanes” in the clave of Fa on something that seems to resemble a mandolin with eleven strings.  The first step, which is certainly a tall order for many, would be to have what seems to resemble a mandolin with eleven strings. The second step is to grow an extra finger or four on both hands to be able to carefully pluck all the strings needed to produce the tune, add a counterpoint, play it as a fugue, add a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to your harmonious fugue, all the while snapping arhythmically to what sounds like the rhythm of a danserye, but only on the downbeats in waltz time with your extra left thumbs, and only in a six-eight meter with your extra right thumbs.*

*Now learn to play it backwards and forwards, in all forty-four keys including quartertones, and take away the frets.*

Of note, von der Vogelweider’s words are said to have held much more sense in the original Middle High German version of his manuscript, though modern scholars argue that Goethe’s 19th century translation of the text into the Wursten Frisian dialect (with footnotes) had much more humor in it than the source material.  Modern scholars speculate that von der Vogelweider's analogy of magic refers specifically to manual rituals, but much to the displeasure to modern magicians, the complexity and difficulty remains widely consistent across all three major classical means of magical ritual.

Coaxing out mana from the core of one’s being is a relatively simple process.  When viewed through magical means, say for example through a 19th century spell known as *Schopenhauser’s Refraktor,* channeled mana naturally elutes from the caster’s core in a somewhat pulsatile rate, with the apex of pulsatile outflow fluctuation rate a fraction of a second after the heartbeat.  For this energy to be channeled into something useful, it must be disciplined and regulated to come out at a consistent rate as required by ritual.  Some spells and rituals require a higher outflow, some lower.  In one case, a sensory-type ritual requires a very slight outflow of mana, followed by holding that mana in place without closing the stream from the caster’s core (similar to holding one’s breath with the mouth wide open).  The caster then “feels” the arcane surface texture that resonates back off of the examined material.

Step two of spellcasting involves molding mana via ritual.  There are three widely known ritual types, and a few others mentioned only in footnotes in the scantly available scrolls written in old or dead languages in libraries better forgotten by man.  One popular method involves the use of incantation.

Incantations are verbal spells written by many mages in their respective native languages.  Translation of these spells from their original languages into the native language(s) of the caster has led to some untoward deviation from the original manifestation intended in the source material.  Not necessarily harmful deviation, per se, but a change (usually negative) in efficacy ultimately results.  It is currently unknown with current thaumaturlogical models why or how verbal ritual molds magic in the way it does, or why exactly a fluctuation in the grammar of an incantation after translation would cause such a change.  Debate is currently ongoing among scholars on this topic, but the unconscious consensus on the subject matter is to accept the pragmatic wisdom that “it’s a craft, not a science” and to simply move on until some clear pattern emerges.  A somewhat popular method, this ritual means of molding mana boasts moderate to high precision at the cost of speed. 

A second method involves molding mana with rituals involving the body and hands.  This method is generally the most popular among contemporary magicians, as it does not require knowledge of foreign or dead languages to exact a mystical phenomenon.  This method requires that the caster have preternaturally flexible and precise hands and wrists, as each spell must be adjusted to the caster.  The position of the fingers and wrists, and the gestures made regulate and throttle the outflow of mana and simultaneously mold it into a physical phenomenon.  This method boasts much higher speed, but may sometimes lack versatility and precision in the hands of a less-experienced caster, relative to verbal rituals.

A third method involves mana molding through written or physical rituals.  This is by far the most time intensive method of producing magical phenomena, but can also be the most powerful and precise.  The return on time invested in preparing a physical ritual, say for example, a standard magical circle inscribed and strategically hidden in enemy territory that produces no visible phenomenon, save for giving a magician a clear vision of everything that transpires within said circle, has meant the difference between certain defeat and victory in a few key battles.  Most of the Scouts of the OOM could recite these key battles before they matriculated in the military organization, thanks in part to nothing more than Bardoni’s *Mystical Hisotry of War,* and rote memorization, both of which plagued many of the bodies of education, both mystical and otherwise.

Other common methods of magic involve some combination of physical, verbal, and manual rituals, depending on the intent of the caster.  The effectiveness of these combined rituals varies, and largely varies on a case-by-case basis.

As a fiddle, you're a lead instrument, probably the most important after the singer(s). So play when the singer isn't singing. You need to decorate the space in a tasteful way. Your job is to make the singer sound good. After considering these points to your functionality, it's all your judgement. Sometimes I play a quiet <b><u>countermelody</u></b> or texture, sometimes I only do "answers" to the vocal line, and sometimes there's nothing wrong with sitting there doing nothing for half the song. It's about serving the song and what it needs, and there's really no one formula to figure that out. 

That pretty much leads into number 2. I think the best advice is to study your music theory and aural skills. When I'm playing Proud Mary (and we play it in A major), I'm thinking about what the other instruments are doing, and using my toolbox of music tricks from studying to do what I want to do. I know that in that song in A, an A blues scale, major scale, or mixolydian scale would be most appropriate. It was a lot of trial and error to figure out what notes in those scales were the "sneaky pokey" notes, but you learn their relationship to the melody. This sort of thing snowballs, and in some years if you keep working at it, it'll be effortless to think about.

So when a friend calls a song that I don't know on stage, and it actually happens often for me, the first thing I do is find the key. Then figure out the form, feel, and language (scales I was talking about earlier) so that I can start to shape my judgement as I learn more about the song. Then, because I'm a lead instrument, I fill space in the song where there needs to be something that isn't vocals for the ear to grab on to. Maybe I'll harmonize with another lead instrument if there is one.

Because there isn't much of a standardized angle to what a violin does in a pop or rock context, it's up to you to decide what your job is. The final important rule I'd say to remember is that "less is more." It's easy to lose focus in soloing, especially in improv like this, but just remember that you don't have to always be playing. Rests are notes too.

I know I enjoy music, and can improvise decently well without structure at a piano...I listen to classical all the time, so I'm not hurting for examples to borrow from, but for some reason I can't write structured music. 

I think I've at least identified the problem, but I don't have a solution. For me, it's perfectionism, or a fear of failure. I want to write a perfect piece the first time, just like the old masters, even though the old masters had to start somewhere. 

I've been trying to tackle this by focusing on actually writing down my ideas, distilling the music motifs down to just a melody. Trying not to get daunted by writing everything at once. Write for piano first, then orchestrate it. 

It's helping a little bit, but I'm still held back by something. I can get a melody, maybe some ornamentation, but no harmony, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, or development. 

Anyway, I share my current struggles in hopes that maybe you can relate to it and not feel alone in the struggle. As we say in engineering, don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Get the biggest pile of crap on the staff paper just to say you wrote something. Then improve upon it. 

That's my goal, anyway. 
</p></li><li><p><b>delusionalartists</b> 2017-09-23 00:52:57 mfranko88<br>It depends on the composer and the piece. A lot of the intructions are imprecise. The tempo markings to begin a piece might say "andante" which is Italian for moderately slow. Ok....how slow is moderately slow? As musicians we probably all agree on a general range, but who gets final say? And later in the piece when it says "accelerando" which means the tempo gets faster. Well what does *that* mean? When do we start getting faster? Is it immediate, like once we hit a certain note do we instantly play faster? Which note? Is it gradual? If so, when do we start the process? Does that increase happen evenly across that whole span of time, or does it really only ramp up as we approach the new section?

The scores that conductors use never really tell you what is the important part to focus on. It might not always necessarily be the melody. If the composer does something interesting in the harmony or a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, maybe that is more interesting. The assumption is that the composer gave us a piece with enough depth that there is no one single way to interpret it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-09-25 07:23:32 hippomancy<br>Listening is a good first step, but what you really want to do is get into the score. I've learned the most from a composer when sitting with their music and labeling every structure I can find. In general, that means finding the form "areas", key of each section, cadences, chords used to modulate (if any) etc. If the work is for large ensemble, identify the role of each instrument (melody, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, accompaniment, other texture), where doublings occur and what pitch and dynamic range each instrument is written in.

After that, try to rewrite a section of the piece, but with a different melody, in the same form, using similar chords and such. If you can do that, you can write like that composer.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-06 03:26:28 MiskyWilkshake<br>Well, it depends what you want them to do. You often see string quartets which are entirely polyphonic, with everybody playing melodies of equal importance, and you also often see the violins playing the main melody and a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> while the viola and cello support. It's entirely up to you, and that's the beauty of such a balanced ensemble. Likely you'll want to change it up mid piece and explore multiple different textures and roles.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-06 05:56:34 The_Original_Gronkie<br>Study 4-part harmony, like hymns, for a bit and you'll see how the voices are distributed - soprano, alto, tenor, bass. Sometimes the soprano and alto are harmonizing, with support or <b><u>countermelody</u></b> from the tenor, and the bass outlining the chord progression. Other times the soprano will be a solo line with the alto and tenor harmonizing and working with the bass to outline the chord progression.

That said, you are truly only limited by your own musical imagination.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2017-10-11 18:39:11 Op3No6<br>Could you analyze the harmony of your own piece?

Using Flat myself, I know the program has most standard chords (including jazz harmony with extensions and alterations) available for notation. You find this by going to "text" and clicking on "chords," and then typing in what you're looking for.

Could you do this and annotate a chord as being, just as an example, an Amaj7 chord, or an E7 chord, or a Bm9 chord?

Further, could you also do a Roman numeral analysis? For instance, can you designate whether a chord is a I, IV, or V in the context of your progression (or any other option)? 

If these exercises would be confusing, I recommend learning how to do this sort of analysis so that you can understand the role of harmony more clearly. 

Also, don't forget to clean up your rests (Flat is terrible about not doing this without user input). For instance, since nothing is playing in your "<b><u>Countermelody</u></b>" section, use whole note rests to clean up the look. In the upper voices of your "Bass" section, you have many opportunities to use a half note rest.

As a final thing, some notes feel as though they need longer sustain. If you want a better feel for this, trying temporarily replacing your pianos with sustain instruments like oboes or the string ensemble tone just to hear your work with the durations clearly heard. The sustain pedal for the piano is located within "dynamics" as well.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-22 09:46:22 ArborealSleep92<br>I’m not even sure what <b><u>countermelody</u></b> is.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-22 10:28:22 bloodhawk713<br><b><u>Countermelody</u></b> is just when you have more than one melody being played simultaneously. For a pretty clear example you can listen to the [2nd movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHxmAsINDk) For the first 40 seconds or so there's only one melody. Then a second one comes in and they're both happening at the same time. If you want to see it visually you can look at this [piano reduction.](https://musescore.com/hmscomp/scores/296446) The second melody comes it at bar 27, where the right hand changes from bass clef to treble clef.
</p></li><li><p><b>melodica</b> 2017-10-24 00:38:02 squaremomisbestmom<br>Okay, so to start with reading music you should probably start out with just treble clef, and just a few of the more simple keys to get used to it. The fun part about the melodica though is that all you really need is a part to fit within the range of your melodica. Other than that, as long as there aren't multiple parts going on (chords/bass line, Melody/<b><u>countermelody</u></b>, etc) you'll be able to play it on the melodica. But for now, just look into reading the treble clef and stick to learning keys like C, F, or Bb. There are definitely a few resources on the internets that could assist you with that.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-10-25 03:52:24 Willravel<br>Not only is there a question of importance, but also dependence. While it's the case in a traditional understanding that polyphony means that both (or all) melodic lines are of equal importance, they are additionally not interdependent but merely in agreement. <b><u>Countermelody</u></b> often shares rhythmic, harmonic, melodic, and background material with the melody, suggesting more than just agreement. Polyphony can share some small aspects, but when too many are introduced it sabotages the independence of the melodic material.

</p></li><li><p><b>gamemusic</b> 2017-11-07 03:44:06 tondef001<br>/u/Gwinbar wrote up a good theory and chord analysis, so I'd like to go at it a bit more abstractly and look particularly at instrumentation.  Nintendo definitely worked their magic with this piece, giving it the adventurous feel that series like The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, and sometimes Kirby pull off so well.

It's important to first acknowledge the era that this game came about in.  Much like the Wii U was fairly defined by big band and swing tunes (particularly in mario games), the Wii era was fairly defined by a move to large orchestral arrangements.  Games like Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, Brawl, and of course Galaxy 1 and 2 all have soundtracks designed to sound adventurous and cinematic.

Gusty Garden highlights this in a big way by opening with a loud fanfare.  Instrumentation is very important here.  The contrast of the low brass and the full trumpet section carries a lot of weight, grabbing your attention.

The brass then disappears completely as the rhythm vamps for a few bars.  The upbeat guitar strumming, low impacts of the timpani, and higher impacts of the background strings set a fast pace, which, to me at least, evokes a feeling of flying through space at high speeds, set for adventure.

The melody begins with a solo clarinet backed by light strings, with an upright base providing the only low sound to frame the chords.  The result is a floaty melody propelled forward by the strumming of guitar and the rest of the strings.  The melody then repeats, building upon itself as the focus shifts to the strings, and then resolves the melody with a variation that introduces and emphasizes the brass.  The result is a melody following something of an A B A C pattern that builds on itself, beginning floaty and soothing, and ending staccato and loud., and all of that in under a minute.

The piece continues following this sort of pattern.  The next section is a trumpet solo backed only by harp arpeggios, a singular snare drum keeping the rhythm moving, and staccato strings for backing.  The section builds by adding an oboe <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and concludes by reintroducing the rest of the horns and strings.  The final section does the same sort of thing, beginning with strings and introducing brass as it builds.

The TL;DR and the reason this is all important, is because the Gusty Garden theme is written to tell a story.  It has a "cinematic" feel because it takes a strong melody and builds and develops it.  It sounds exciting and adventurous because it drives forward with the rhythm while using its winds and strings to craft sweeping melodies that grow and carry weight.  Beyond this, there's the syncopation of the rhythm and triplets in the melody that provide constant feelings of motion.  Overall, the piece does a great job of evoking the feelings it wants to evoke, and it fits perfectly in a fun space adventure.

1. Create a template with markers for song sections. 

2. Place your unfinished work in the chorus section. If you have at least 3 tracks, go to Step 3.     If you have less than 3 tracks,  add your chords, melody, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, drums, etc. 

3. Now copy that section to the entire track.  Mute tracks that don't work for each section. Then delete the muted sections. 

5. Add fills and any other sounds, variations, etc. 

6. Mix.

</p></li><li><p><b>Trombone</b> 2017-11-10 22:22:24 gurgelblaster<br>In general, your plan sounds more or less the way I'd do it, though I'd probably start with the sheet music already on the first listen. YMMV.

If you've got the complete arrangements (as recordings or sheet music), I'd look for places where you're playing an "important" part, for example a trombone chorus or so. If you miss out on some complex tutti part that's a smaller loss than fubbing a trombone section chorus (or two trombones + two saxes or so). Likewise if playing background hits behind someone else playing (or singing) melody or solo, that's less critical than playing melody/<b><u>countermelody</u></b> stuff yourself.

What I'm getting at is: importance is a better metric when choosing what to practise than difficulty.

Apart from that: timing timing timing

Also, when you arrive (if you've got time), see if you can pull aside some other trombonist to tell you all the little things that may have come up during practise - specific phrasings, any small (or big) changes in the arrangements, any weird or unclear stuff you may encounter during your own practise etc.

Also timing. And key/chord/function. And timing, again.

It's difficult at first, but it's so much better in the long run. It gives you options when playing parts that are mostly from red to orange, making them more comfortable, as well. Never ever stretch your pinky, it's bad for it and it'll get you in a bad habit.

Find some slower songs with zero dots to dip your toe in, maybe one dot if you're feeling bold. I'd say make sure it's a song you're familiar with, but bass is trickier to sightread from memory of the song, as it's often a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. Try and get reliable at them, forcing yourself to move your hand and get in the rhythm of it. It's really just a grind. Bass has it hardest on the jump up, because of the sheer number of notes required for the full multiplier.

That being said, I'm sure you'll pick it up quickly enough. :)

Most of all, good luck. Rock Band/Guitar Hero are much more rewarding on Hard/Expert.
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b> 2017-11-14 21:33:26 RANDOSTORYTHROWAWAY<br>It's a neat intro but it's kind of a jumble from a writing perspective. When you've got a lot going on it can feel like too much. I personally approach writing any kind of music from a barber shop perspective, in that I think most people max out at being able to listen to about 4 distinct lines. Even in a huge orchestra you'll never really hear that much competition between the parts. There's a melodic line, sometimes a melodic duet, sometimes also one <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, and then the rest is all support. When your top 2 guitars are just harmonizing it clears up great, and after the intro I'd say drop the clean part.

Another thing is mix-wise, you can really only fit two guitar parts in at the same time. Even crazy prog bands max out at 3 and they've got crazy extended ranges and do tons of rhythm trading.

For instrumental music though, you still kind of need a 'vocal' llots One part needs to be the clear lead (or lead with some doubling) most of the time so your musical ideas don't get all mishmashed. This is why a lot of prog bands also have big screaming sections in the vocal lines, it lets a singer 'get out of the way' of the more wild guitar parts.

But having said that, it's still a good effort and you have lots of potential here, as a player and with this song

The whole piece revolves around chromaticism, so that's why it may sound strange, but I tried to *really* root the harmony with two separate accompaniments and a secondary line repeating the melody.

To simplify, this is how it went on a timeline

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-11-19 14:21:40 xiipaoc<br>&gt; If I just pressed keys at random / slammed my face into the piano, you wouldn't call it counterpoint, so there are evidently some requirements.

I'm not saying that all music is contrapuntal, obviously.  But where you're worried about the rules of free counterpoint, what I'm saying is that there really aren't any; you should write whatever you feel like writing, and if the thing you feel like writing isn't counterpoint, then I don't know what to tell you.

&gt; This is not what people mean when they talk about counterpoint in this particular context. Rather, people are referring to something along the lines of baroque counterpoint

No, you should go back and listen to the music you don't think is contrapuntal.  You absolutely need to keep the bass and melody in good counterpoint, even if your bass is actually more like a cantus firmus than a general melody.  You need to avoid parallel fifths and parallel octaves between bass and melody just the same.  I'd assume that a lot of amateur songwriters don't really notice this, but they at least would notice that it sounds weird when they do it so they'd write their melody differently.  If you've ever written a melody over a bass line, you know what I'm talking about.  And even the rhythmic complementation is present, where you have a more active bass line when the melody is less active.

I think you're also looking at popular music too narrowly if you generally assume that there's only one bass note per bar.  Not all bassists are that slow!

&gt; By comparison, an accompanying bassline does not need much independent melodic or rhythmic interest, though it is nice when it has.

You might not think of the bassline as a melody, but it is.  Anything you can pick out while listening is a melody.  You should try to listen specifically to the bass in the music you listen to (you may need to use headphones or at least good speakers, since computer speakers usually SUCK ASS below, like, 100 Hz), and see how it plays with the melody.  Almost always, your melody will only sound good if it contrasts with and complements the bass, but you may not be thinking about that while writing it.

&gt; an intuitive feeling for how to write music comes with experience

Kinda, but an intuitive feeling for *what* music to write is something that requires inspiration.  It's not a mechanical process.  That's true for any kind of creative endeavor.  You start with a blank; what do you put in that blank?  You have to answer that for yourself.  And that's still true when it comes to counterpoint.  What is causing you to need to write counterpoint?  Do you have a melody and you're trying to write a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>?  That's still not a mechanical process; you need to *compose* that <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.  Rules will get you nowhere; how do you want your <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to sound?  Start with that, figure out whether it sounds good, and *then* you can worry about which rules you may or may not have broken in an attempt to figure out where to improve your composition.

Listening to music may well help you figure out how you want your <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to go.  That's true.  But that's true for any sort of compositional process.  What you need in order to write counterpoint is to compose all of the different lines.  That's not necessarily *easy*, but that's what it is.  Composition.  Not rule following.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-11-19 14:50:14 Kalcipher<br>&gt; you should write whatever you feel like writing, and if the thing you feel like writing isn't counterpoint, then I don't know what to tell you.

This tricky equivocation is at the center of the confusion. Writing what I feel like in the sense of going by my musical intuition is not the same as writing what I want to write. The latter is counterpoint, the former is not.

&gt; No, you should go back and listen to the music you don't think is contrapuntal. You absolutely need to keep the bass and melody in good counterpoint, even if your bass is actually more like a cantus firmus than a general melody.

I'm from a country largely without tradition of teaching species counterpoint, and when you examine them, many cantus firmi do not have independent melodic interest or completeness by themselves. For that reason, as you might suspect, when I showed my fifth-species counterpoint to my teacher, he was quite confused and didn't think it was contrapuntal. I am not saying this standard is the only reasonable one, but just that being capable of writing a bassline "in good counterpoint" with the melody is not necessarily enough to be able to write baroque counterpoint, canons, or fugues.

&gt; You need to avoid parallel fifths and parallel octaves between bass and melody just the same.

True, but you don't need to prioritize imperfect dissonances as a general rule, because your bassline is intended to complement the melody, which in turn carries the main melodic interest, but at least it seems you acknowledge the existence of rules now (though of course they don't necessarily carry the final word) Anyway, to be completely unambiguous, I am capable of writing a bassline that is similar to a cantus firmus in both imitation of baroque music and in contemporary contexts. In neither of those styles am I able to write a bassline similar to a fugal countersubject or like those out of Bach's inventions.

&gt; Kinda, but an intuitive feeling for what music to write is something that requires inspiration.

The potential for such inspiration is predicated on existing experience though. Somebody with no experience at all might want to learn to write music, but if you ask them whether they want to write jazz, metal, fugues, etc., they might give you a blank stare. The prevalence of pop music makes it likely that they will have experience with that at least, and so might be able to say they'd write pop music, but without familiarity with, say, Quan Ho music, even if that was what they would want to write given the familiarity, they are probably not going to suddenly be inspired to write anything in that style.

&gt; What is causing you to need to write counterpoint?

I want to work my way towards being able to write a double fugue for four parts.

&gt; Do you have a melody and you're trying to write a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>?

Sure. I have several even.

&gt; you need to compose that <b><u>countermelody</u></b>.

Which is where I get stuck, because my attempts sound bad, to put it simply. I can identify the problems, with the main one being no sense of rhythmic cohesiveness, which makes the countersubject sound fractured and not at all like an independent melodic line, but rather like repeated incidences of unrelated accompaniment.

&gt; Rules will get you nowhere

Seems plainly untrue.

&gt; how do you want your <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to sound?

I have no clear conceptualization for that. I don't have very good auditory imagery it seems, or at least not when trying to imagine something original.

&gt; figure out whether it sounds good

It doesn't.

&gt; and then you can worry about which rules you may or may not have broken in an attempt to figure out where to improve your composition.

The problem is solely with the rhythmic aspect. I was never good at rhythm, having literally no sense of rhythm (like with beat deafness) except when I'm very slightly drunk. Maybe I should just get very slightly drunk next time I want to write counterpoint.

&gt; That's not necessarily easy, but that's what it is. Composition. Not rule following.

Rules are a simplification, it is more about imitating, extrapolating, suspending, completing and violating patterns than rules. From your comment history, I understand you're a programmer. Imagine having to write a program to generate music procedurally. You might give it some parameters to vary and then otherwise go by strict rules, but that rarely works out well. Consider the difference between that, and a general artificial intelligence writing music. It's not completely arbitrary, and if I'm not able to understand these patterns, I will end up with pure noise. Musical notation and my instruments certainly put a constraint on the sort of noise, and with my current capabilities I can write something that sounds nice, but that's relying on broader patterns of tonal and functional harmony and doesn't help me with my rhythmic challenges.

What is the context of the piece? What is the game about? =)

Here are some notes I made (from the perspective of what a consumer would think if they were listening to this on loop in a game menu: 

- The piece sounds nice and retro, perhaps even zombie-like
- The "kick drum" needs to have some variation (in dynamics from the first beat of the bar); the little "popping" sound of the kick would quickly grate on the ears
- the main instrument sounds a little forced in the higher range, and may need more variation

From a composer's perspective:
- On the theme of variation, there could be extra instruments in the background, like a thrumming bass line that fades in and out, or another "<b><u>countermelody</u></b>" instrument to highlight an idea of "playfulness".
- Perhaps you could think about changing key after the second repeat of "G, Eb, C -------- C Eb G ------" at about 1.08, as it would break the feeling of repetitive "monotony" if you are on the main menu for an extended period of time.


All this being said, I do like the premise and it sounds ghoulish without having too serious a tone =) keep up the great work!

The acoustic bass guitar plucks a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that wanders above and below most reasonable crossover frequencies, tending to give an impression of it wandering around the soundstage. If it sounds natural on your system, you're either doing something right or else you just have a very high or very low crossover.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2017-11-23 19:16:03 Vovabs<br>I liked it. Makes me nostalgic about old-school cartoon soundtracks. 

I think it would work nicely with more layers as the thing goes on - maybe a triangle that's added on, maybe a  piano <b><u>countermelody</u></b> somewhere at the end, maybe some violins in the background - just to add some fullness.

But I really see what you were going for and liked it. Good job :)
</p></li><li><p><b>roastmytrack</b> 2017-11-27 11:51:44 EricZak<br>Love those lush filtered synths. Nice sound all around. Only critique would be that I was hoping for a change of some kind around the 1:40 mark to give it a feel of building to a climax (like maybe adding some layered harmonies, <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, or additional instrumentation). Just a suggestion. Otherwise nice track.
</p></li><li><p><b>AskReddit</b> 2017-11-29 11:34:59 gingerfer<br>/u/lazing_in_the_welkin explained it very well, the only thing I can add is that they used something called Tonal Architecture to make the Heart of Lorkhan do what they wanted. Tonal Architecture is using sound to warp reality, like the Thu'um in Skyrim - sounds and music are important to the "science" of the game's world. 

Their head scientist, Kagrenac, designed and used tools for this purpose. Those were Sunder - a bigass hammer they used to hit the Heart and make the power come out, Keening - a knife used to slice and direct said power, and Wraithguard - a gauntlet that kept the user from getting too close to the raw power itself. 

To expand on the sound thing, the whole universe is made of a song. If you sing along with it, you can add your own little <b><u>countermelody</u></b> like the Thu'um that changes some things but the song goes on. I heard someone once say that with the Numidium the Dwemer didn't just sing along, they tried to start their own drum solo.
</p></li><li><p><b>movies</b> 2017-12-01 03:03:51 your_mind_aches<br>Someone pointed out that it's basically a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to the Avengers theme! The Hydra theme on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is pretty memorable too. But that's TV which is pretty much forced to reuse themes anyway. 
</p></li><li><p><b>futurebeatproducers</b> 2017-12-04 18:37:31 3ND500N<br>Cheers for the input, very thorough. I'd say your track is lacking a little energy, if you want to bring this out I'd suggest bumping up the mid-high end a little. I'd also suggest maybe a second synth that provides a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>? The track only seems to do "one thing" so to speak so there's not much progression in my eyes.

Other than that the mix is good and I did enjoy it :)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-12-05 08:44:55 65TwinReverbRI<br>If it's "melodic" the best word is probably <b><u>Countermelody</u></b>.

However, if it's just playing the upper note of a 4 part harmony or something, it's just part of the harmony. No real name for that (other than like "Trumpet Part" or if more than one, "Trumpet 1" etc.).

Maybe "Obbligato"?

Sometimes that word is used to mean an important part that needs to be included.

Another one from my upcoming concept album. Really focusing on lyrics this week, i wanted each line to build on the other one, so you gain new information as you hear. 

Played with the structure, starts off in F; states entire theme, transition to Eb, theme but with <b><u>countermelody</u></b>, transition to F#, louder theme.

Neglecting the bassline. You can have the best melody in history and it'll still sound like shit if you don't have a good bass support.

Lack of <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. Gives your song something interesting to listen to, otherwise it sounds flat and empty.
</p></li><li><p><b>thomasthedankengine</b> 2017-12-09 10:25:39 aldonius<br>Nice! 

The main melody is rather loud relative to everything else though - as a result the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> is very quiet.
</p></li><li><p><b>TheaterDays</b> 2017-12-11 03:31:00 DarkFuzz<br>Little bit late to the party, but whatever.

While there are a lot of songs that I'd like to have, given the way Theater Days has been releasing the songs, I'll try to stay within the realm of possibility, meaning only LTP solos from the MLs and the group songs from LTH.  I'll still hold out for Hibiki's "Rebellion" though.

* Liar Rouge - Shiho and Kana are the only two MLs from the movie that haven't gotten songs yet.  Not gonna lie, this song made my impression of her do a 180 from the movie.  I didn't really like Kana's song from LTP that much though; much more partial to Omajinai.

* Maria Trap - Glorious song in and of itself, but what stood out to me was the back and forth Tomoka has with herself.  I'd really like to see that mapped, tbh.

* Decoration Dreamin' - I only recently started liking Momoko a lot.  She looks a lot like Mafuyu from Blend S, and that's when I started paying more attention to Momoko.  This song was catchy when I first heard it too.  "Doo, doo, do-do, doo, doo-doot"

* Omoi wa Carnival - A favorite of mine, but one that's out in left field for possibly the whole franchise.  I don't think we truly have had a Latin song in any of the games ever, except maybe you can argue for "DREAM".  Elena's song is one that I would like to see executed well.

* Eternal Harmony - While this may be an excuse just to hopefully nab more Chihaya stuff, I think the intro piano and the <b><u>countermelody</u></b> electric guitar works really well.

* Birth of Color - I think the more intense voices of Makoto and Ayumu work well with the softer voices of Yukiho and Azusa (and Kana is somewhere in the middle).  Great solo parts, great unison chorus, and amazing harmonies.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b> 2017-12-11 06:15:32 65TwinReverbRI<br>While what little music I write is not "avant garde" and sometimes even minimalisticly simplistic sometimes, I do try to use forms that have a similar level of "contemporary-ness" to them.

Since I'm a pop guy, I often think in intro-verse-chorus kind of structures and I don't really try to write Rounded Binary, or Ternary, or Sonata Form or things like that.

I tend to just kind use what I'd consider broader ideas of form - like "some junk, then some different junk, then either on to some other new junk or back to the first junk".

Very often, if I return to an idea, it's modified in some way (like a return of an A section might appear in 3/4 in a much more grandiose tempo than the original appearance in 4/4 or something).

If often use "interrupted" or "interjected" ideas within phrases and sections, as well as extending and truncating things to less-than-typical lengths.

The most recent piece I finished goes kind of like this:

Intro - Phrase 1, Phrase 2 with extension.

The next section takes that introductory idea and varies it - Phrase 1 is complete but "phrase 1.5" is both a truncated version of phrase 2 and inserted in between phrase 1 and 2, and then 2 appears, modified, in its extended form.

The next section is sort of the first "main" section, where Phrase 1 appears again, but is extended, then is followed by an "answer" that is based on Phrase 2, but rhythmically and melodically makes it a more "normal" antecedent/consequent structure.

But, Phrase 2 appears in extended form and is answered again.

So it's like I went Phrase 1 Phrase 1, Phrase 2 Phrase 2 this time - and as you can see, each time each section gets a bit more extended - so this is like double the original, and you can think of it either way. In my mind it's sort of like:

a | b ||: a :||: b :||

Then a transitional section begins which presages the next main theme. It's a kind of "stretto" idea where This new phrase is answered by itself overlapped rather than in succession. It repeats in <b><u>countermelody</u></b> (which introduces a new idea) and then completes the section.

The next section is this new idea, so a "B" section (I actually did modulate to the "Dominant" but totally unintentionally when I was writing - it's quartal so I wasn't really thinking that, but sure enough, that's where I went, so it does make it that much more like a traditional B section!).

It's a 3 phrase section, with the last section being transitional again - the phrases are comprised of the "new" material in the section before, and answered with imitation also from that previous section.

Now it goes back to that first "main" section, just basically arranged and orchestrated differently

this time it completes all 3 phrases without transition, then starts as if it's going to repeat it yet a 4th time, then sneakily starts a transition that sort of takes the very intro idea and plays phrase 1 modified three times, and then goes to phrase 2 in its extended version like at the top.

Then the main main section comes back, but ideas from the B section interject the A section material.

Builds to a climax, then the intro is repeated pretty much as was (different instrumentation), then there's just a little final idea that's basically just a cadential chord.

So maybe, without introduction and transitions, you could call it

A - B - A - A&amp;B

•error-vixx
•ending scene-iu
•rewind-got7
•rough-gfriend

error is a video i ended up watching the music video of and by then end i was sniffling so hard?? like... the song itself, it’s easy to hear the despair and bitterness in the lyrics through their tones and the instrumentation but the music video reallllly got me. everything about hongbin’s expressions, the instrumental break, the ending— ooh. right in the heart.

speaking of endings... ending scene was another song where the music video just made me cry. i am always a sucker for bittersweet messages like that song’s: “i hope you can find someone who can love you. i’m sorry it wasn’t me.” 

rewind is honestly a song that isn’t teary sad so much as it is an angry sad. i listened to the song and loved it for its sound and build and the overall musicality of it, but reading the lyrics was honestly so heart wrenching; the message is one that hits home, really.

rough, honestly, is like ending scene: the feeling of if only is always a message that will get me. the orchestra instruments and the harmonies/<b><u>countermelody</u></b> only add to the feelings of bittersweetness. i know this one is a bit happier, but overall it just gets to me.

for me it always takes a combination of lyrics &amp; instrumentals &amp; visuals, but these four are the songs that always come first to mind!
</p></li><li><p><b>thatHappened</b> 2017-12-14 14:25:23 Anthony7500<br>Ok, I have had my inner music nerd triggered. Owning 2 mellophones I can tell you they are fully incapable of a "<b><u>countermelody</u></b>" to a trumpet, I actually changed from trumpet to mellophone in my high school's band cause we have 7 trumpets and I was bored and wanted to actually put my mellophones to use. A mellophone is not pitched the same as a trumpet, one of mine has 4 slides for F, Eb, C, and Bb (the other just the Eb). Secondly there are 2 types of mellophone, classical (which are what mine are), and marching mellophone. A high school probably wouldn't have a marching mellophone so that leaves us with classic mellophones. The classic mellophone is basically phased out in the 60's-70's. That means the director just punted a vintage horn that could be worth thousands of dollars. Lastly whatever the fuck they meant by counter melody is probably something mirroring a trumpet. You would use a cornet for that, or since the person who wrote this seems to go to a high school that has everything, a copper belled trumpet would work fine.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b> 2017-12-21 06:47:13 earsablissin<br>It might sound silly, but one thing alone hugely improved my songwriting - instrumentals. Often people think of songwriting as lyrics/verses/bridges/choruses. But actually that's the most limiting way to view them, and you only want those strict repetitive devices and sections if creating mainstream pop.


The reality is that interesting song writing, structure and arrangement is totally subject to the placement of instrumentals. Vocaless sections.


Think about it - instrumentals are small pieces of music that can be any length, any shape, bridging any section. They can divide a verse. They can dovetail a verse into another section. They can be big melodies, or simply holding a groove. They can be the verse melody. They can be a <b><u>countermelody</u></b>. 


The problems of not writing an arrangement with them in mind are huge - if you keep adding sections to an arrangement to fix the monotony and predictability of a verse/chorus, all those sections will have vocals. Introducing more and more ideas unnecessarily. Ideas that normally logically &lt;have&gt; to have a certain amount of time to play out with a rhyming scheme or narrative. Which means you end up trying to fix an arr with a section of 30seconds, rather than a section of 5seconds. And you'll prob have to repeat that again. 


Look at 50s jazz singers. They're songs are maybe 2:00-2:30 and have 2 verses. And they stand the test of time. The trick is - it's not what's done when the singer is singing, but when they're not. That's what to listen for.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2017-12-26 01:59:26 all_thetime<br>Wow this is very beautiful.  The introduction is so smooth and unique and it's mixed wonderfully!  I got to say though I'm not a fan of the harsh sound effects you ended and the second layer of vocals you added.  I do think it needed a second layer of vocals for the second half of the song, but I think you should do them different.  I would suggest you sing some adlibs with a rhythym that is unique to the track (so like not singing the same rhythym of the main melody or not just adding some whole notes or something boring like that) as well as a <b><u>countermelody</u></b> to add some contrast.  For example, (sorry if this makes no sense) "bum bum, bum bum, bum bum" or "la la, la la, la la," with a beat like 1 2 rest 4 1 rest 3 4 rest 2 3, notes being something, e f, e f, e d, e g, etc etc

Great job!
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b> 2017-12-26 03:34:11 ItIsHippie<br>Good relaxing stuff. 

As far as length, I can tell you knew when to stop with the length you had. That's good. Definitely continue to listen to that intuition going forward, and you will feel exactly when your track gets repetitive. 
For me, I hear a change in the drum pattern right after the place where the track currently stops, and also a chopping up of the piano to make the track more rhythmic while keeping the atmosphere. I'm not sure if that means replacing the piano entirely with chops though. I can hear both layering over the original, and just the chops on it's own. You knew when to stop with what you currently have, so I trust you have a good ear on what's going to sound better. 
And like sayntfuu said, adding a clean verse would give this song a unique signature, because right now it sounds like a typical lo-fi hip-hop song that thousands of other people are already doing. That's up to you though. If you want to keep this as an instrumental, adding some type of weird <b><u>countermelody</u></b> that's surprising, but doesn't break the flow of the song will be intriguing to whoever's listening, and elevate this above a typical lo-fi hip-hop track. Totally up to you to what you want that to be.

I also hear some technical stuff in here that could be improved too. You didn't ask about that specifically, so I just leave my inbox open if you want to follow up.

Good start! Continue to trust your ear!
