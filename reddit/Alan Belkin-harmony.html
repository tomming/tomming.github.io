https://books.google.ee/books?id=dxfALsh5wgUC&amp;source=gbs_book_similarbooks - an introductory book on Debussy, but a good read, delves a bit into the music as well. 

https://books.google.ee/books/about/Debussy_and_the_Veil_of_Tonality.html?id=WxrrQiB4U9cC&amp;redir_esc=y 
This book deals with Debussy's work, mainly <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 

An interesting read on the form of Debussy: http://upers.kuleuven.be/sites/upers.kuleuven.be/files/page/files/2010_1_2.pdf

All of the referenced literature from that essay might also be interesting. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTwvtwlSh5U Here is a video of harmonic analysis by Debussy. 

Really if you search for "Debussy analysis" or "Debussy" from Google books or Google scholar, you will find a lot of stuff to read. https://www.google.ee/search?q=debussy+analysis&amp;oq=debussy+analysis&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.2168j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8 Same with Ravel. Do some searching of your own as well. And then, after having read things, look through the scores again and you'll learn more again. 

Another very style-pure impressionist to take a look at would be Lili Boulanger. Died young and has few works, but she is amazing as well. Here is a video on her piece, that mainly delves into orchestration (also a very important factor in impressionist music and sound is the new and unique orchestration approach they brought about), but also takes a cursory look at <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJJU1GPMKQw


Otherwise, also you might want to take a look at 20th century music that expands on the ideas of the impressionists. I'd say take a look at Messiaen, Takemitsu and Dutilleux. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, no. 

All intervals are used in counterpoint. The seconds and sevenths are considered dissonances and there are rules as to how to utilize them. The fourths are considered dissonances in two-part writing, consonances in the upper voices of 3+ part writing. Octaves, fifths and fourths are not used in parallel motion, as that detracts from the individuality of the voices. So you see most parallel motions in 3rds and 6ths. The ubiquity of 3rds is also simply because western <b><u>harmony</u></b> and chords are all built by thirds. 

All of what I said applies to Bach, however, with Debussy you already get a completely different musical language. There is 150 years between the two, after all. And all of this is a gross simplification. You really need to just study counterpoint to get a deeper understanding: http://www.opus28.co.uk/Fux_Gradus.pdf


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>This is such a huge question that I can either give a very brief and dense answer or try and write a book on it. 

But I've tried to articulate it to myself. Bear in mind that translating aesthetic choices to words is already an inexact process of translation between the mediums of music to the medium of perception and from there to the medium of written language, so this is just one way articulating my thoughts. I could concede to a more accurate and completely opposite way of approaching what makes music good and not necessarily think myself as being hypocritical. These are just one of the many ways for me to think of this question. 

But in this interpretation good music, for me, has a tension between two elements. I'm not talking about <b><u>harmony</u></b>, rhythm, melody or any of the structural elements of music, but rather, elements of perception. It has to have something that I can grasp and something that I immediately do not grasp. There is ideally a musical idea that immediately holds me in its logic and purpose and some elements that subvert it, are in an unclear connection to it or simply remain a mystery. This might seem like I am speaking of an incredibly specific type of music, but I think this logic of clarity-in-clarity can be seen in almost all music, including simple music. Xenakis once said of Palestrina a wonderful thing (and sadly I could not find the quote, so you'll have to trust my memory) that even though the music has absolute strict logic and integrity of all of the voices, this very thing results in a listening experience that is often a mush, where voices blend into each other, sometimes the mind focuses on one, then the other, etc. In the listening experience there is form and chaos combined, you cannot grasp all of the music at once. Similar things can be said of other complex polyphonic music. 

Here I feel I have written myself to a corner, I cannot put it simply and continue, but sufficed to say that clarity and opaqueness are relative to each piece and their chosen musical language. There can be opaque elements in very simple pieces and there can be clear dramatic arcs in incredibly dense scores. The relation between them and the interpretative complexities that follow is what makes the music alive. Clear elements to grab the attention and "give a thesis" and opaque elements that don't simply lend themselves to be explained away, but somehow connected with the rest of the piece. Sometimes the very rational core structure of the piece can give rise to this denseness. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I will say that it's good that you are bold with your dissonances. 

What u/Barcelona_City_Hobo said isn't wrong of course, you should learn your standard <b><u>harmony</u></b> and structure, but don't lose your boldness. I see a lot of very conservative beginner composers out here, experimenting is good. The experiments might be failures, but you'll learn a lot from them. 

This particular score does seem very much like a sketch and needs thorough re-working though. Try to be conservative with your material, if you come up with a theme or melody, try and repeat it with some variation and develop it. Same with harmonies. Right now it's a bunch of ideas thrown together without anything really connecting them. 

Also dissonant low register chords with the piano are really muddy, bear that in mind. 

3 hand piano piece is also really an unusual format. You might try to write for just 2 hands or 4 hands on the piano. Or a piano and a melodic instrument. 

That first chord is nice though. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>3:4, 5:4, 7:4, 3:5, 3:7 next! Then irrational meters. 

That said, very nice piece. You have a knack for tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> with some very nice quirks. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Wow, you have really nice sounding samples. The piece sounds pretty grand. 

It's definitely not my style of music, so maybe I'm not the right person to criticize this. I think you emulate a lot of bombastic orchestral soundtrack music pretty well. The score is pretty blunt in it's texture and very bombastic, there isn't any development, really and the themes come and go. But all of that is often in style with soundtrack music, so really, I can't say that you should change any of that. At times it does feel like, though, that you can flesh your <b><u>harmony</u></b> out more. A lot of the motion is in octaves and that pitch of the theme and the bass dominates. Filling out the middle pitches of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, making the <b><u>harmony</u></b> more full, should improve some sections. The brass in particular plays always in unis or octaves, it seemed to me. It sounds "empty" very often. 

From an orchestration standpoint, you at no point indicate if the woodwinds or brass play solo or a2, a3. You do have "2 trumpets" in marked in the clef, but you should still specify. At times your brass writing seems pretty high as well. I'm not a brass player, but the horns from bar 117 on seem unplayable. Same with trumpets on the C above the treble clef, not quite unplayable, but pretty unstable note. Same about the oboe on 172 onward. Playable by a very good pro, I guess, but kind of iffy. 

I guess all I would add is keeping learning and fine-tuning and making your orchestration more subtle and varied. There is too much to really say and learn for me to summarize here, it's such a huge topic, obviously. All composers keep leaning that craft their entire lives. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>You have a knack for coming up with rather good themes. And the orchestration is fine. But this feels like a sketch and, as you said, rather sparse as such. It lacks the excitement it could have, in my opinion. 

In order to flesh it out, I think the foremost work to make this a very fine piece would be a lot of fine carving. I mean not presenting material with the same texture constantly. With your piano writing for example you set up a texture of backing chord or arpeggio and melody and don't deviate from it throughout the entirety of presenting your material. This works well in the climaxes, but the between sections could use some spicing up. What would help immensely and also serve as a tool for development is simply approaching this material with all of the capabilities that the piano and the orchestra gives you for exciting possibilities of presenting the material. I'd approach this almost like a piano concerto, so make use of some exciting concertante writing! Arpeggios that span many octaves, more interesting left hand patterns etc. The melody may appear in a high register, then in low register. Add a contrapuntal voice from some instrument of the orchestra. 

Each bar could theoretically be colored differently. In terms of patterns of accompaniment, the way the melody is stated, which instruments provide the background color, etc, etc.  A bar is not simply a place to put the dots of the correct <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody. It's a playground. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There is new classical music being composed all the time. If you want really new then check out some works from this decade. Unsuk Chin, Chaya Czernowin, Thomas Ades, Erkki-Sven Tüür, Magnus Lindberg, Kaija Saariaho, Andrew Norman, etc. etc. Most composers, if they are not specifically working in the style of minimalism, these days are pretty damn harmonically complex. Often the work is not based on "chords" per se, but other pitch organization principles resulting in <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Historically and in traditional functional practice certainly. That's the way they have entered the musical language. Still, from more modern classical and especially in pop-rock music they are often present without the preceding <b><u>harmony</u></b> from which the single voice is suspended, nor are they always resolved. You could argue that in that case they are quartal or quintal harmonies, but if they appear in a rock song that generally has triadic harmonic language, then I'd say they are more like an emancipated dissonance/<b><u>harmony</u></b>: our ear has come accustomed to the sound and so it can appear without the "proper rules" of dealing with it in terms of classical handling of dissonance. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It will probably be the root note of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, yes. Of course sometimes modulations are gradual and there might be disagreement as to at what point we are in a new tonal or modal center. The important thing is that the dominating pitch is A. That is the "home", G is the 7th step and resolves a full step up into A in the context of A dorian, even though you might think in terms of the "G major scale" here. As another person stated, if you get accustomed to playing in modes, then you will no longer need to think of the corresponding major scale to identify them. If you say to me "F# lydian" I can construct the scale immediately without having to think of the C# major scale. 
</p></li><li><p><b>movies</b><br>Yes! 

Finally I see someone who agrees with me that the direction of Luke was probably the only good idea and step somebody in the script-writing process had in this movie. (I otherwise think it was pretty bad and messy, with all the other elements overshadowing what would have been a good main theme for the movie - the theme of the force from this new angle and how light and dark relate to it - Rey and Ren) 

Luke as a jaded teacher type is great. The realizations he has come to are great. And I'd be tempted to say, not only daoist, but more zen buddhist: realizing that since the force is everywhere and binds all things, it is not necessary for one to be "great" or have great lineage to be the savior. Force users will continue to arise (the orphan kid). This is the point of Reys parents being nobodies. (Or could be, unless that's another twist) All that one needs to do is live in the moment (as Yoda puts it) and be in peace and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, which ultimately Luke does - the logical end-point of such a philosophy. As such the Jedi and their code are but form, meant to convey some substance, yes, but simply form nonetheless. The Jedi can go extinct, it is just a word, as are the books. Which is why I think it would have been even more meaningful to literally have Yoda burn the books. Would have been a very zen-master thing to do. If you see the Buddha on the road, kill him. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>A few resources:

* There is a book - 20th century <b><u>harmony</u></b> by Vincent Persichetti. Somwhat dated (Written in 1961), but still often referred to in study, from what I've come across. 

* Alan Belkin has made a video series on Youtube describing modern <b><u>harmony</u></b> - linear <b><u>harmony</u></b>, modal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, intervallic <b><u>harmony</u></b>, combinations. http://alanbelkinmusic.com/site/en/index.php/2017/05/25/an-online-modern-<b><u>harmony</u></b>-course/ . This is maybe slightly conservative and basic for some. 

* [Messiaens *La technique de mon langage musical.*](https://monoskop.org/images/5/50/Messiaen_Olivier_The_Technique_of_My_Musical_Language.pdf) is compulsory reading for any burgeoning composer. Chapter XIII, XIV deal with <b><u>harmony</u></b> specifically, also taking a look at his inspirations in French impressionism. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Again I don't think that example works. Schoenber WAS trying to solve a problem: the problem of having a system to work within after abandoning western functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Before this he had a period of free atonality, but that was not without problems. For one how do you organize material? He used inversions, retrogrades, mirror structures etc, but that wasn't enough. Further tonality had a nasty habit of still sinking into that material. Dodecaphony was a method that helped the composer organize the music as well as made sure that no one tone was preferred over the other - to answer the problem of tonality sub-consciously returning. 

And Schoenberg immediately started breaking the rules of his own system. Not did he, as far as I remember, ever require strict adherence from his students. 
</p></li><li><p><b>badmusicology</b><br>I'd hesitate to call Tagg bad musicology. I quite like his work and he is referenced quite frequently in certain circles. So that's my position upfront here. 

The point of this video to an extent, I think, is to demonstrate the disconnect between the simple etymological meaning of the word and the actual historical use. Tonality is a term that has specific meanings in some historical contexts and this meaning has changed throughout it's use. In fact I think you perhaps lack knowledge on this part. During certain periods we would use tonality as referencing to the harmonic system of the "common practice period". (This includes both minor and major and also how these diatonic scales are used - functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and cadences. The minor scale can not be natural either, for example or it would lack the strong semitone resolution) In this case indeed tonality would be contrasted with modality. In our times, what we contrast "tonality" with is the modernist legacy and the avant-garde and under such a distinction, obviously modal music seems very tonal. 

This is essentially to point out an ideological core in the term tonality. "Tonal" music as being "our" music, the "common" music. Other types of music being a-tonal - essentially with the connotation of noise. This sort of naturalization of ones own culture is essentially the core ideological process. 

Reverting to the simple etymological definition of the word is to point out this historical use. Tonality is as pointed out in the video "verbal communication used by a particular community using a particular shared vocabulary." (4.30) However Tagg disagrees with some of the distinctions this term brings about and would rather use the term in a different manner. This is quite a paradigm shift when compared to traditional musicology - Tagg is quite a good example of "new" or post-modern musicology. But this accusation that he doesn't know what he is talking about is suspect. 
</p></li><li><p><b>badmusicology</b><br>&gt; None of this matters, in the end. You can insult my understanding of the history of the term as much as you like - it won't change the fact that this man obviously lacks the most basic understanding of the word. No matter how much he wants to teach us the idea that etymologically speaking, the word is disconnected, he is still committing the etymological fallacy by arguing that its etymology needs to be the only direction for how we define the term (which, funny enough, makes him the one to entirely disregard history in favour of shallow linguistics). This is a person who understands neither linguistics nor tonality - etymology is not king, and tonality does not refer to any system of organization at all.

You say historical use doesn't matter. I'd say it does. I guess we are at an impasse. He is not committing the etymological fallacy because he has a specific reason for wanting to discard the historical use.  

&gt; and tonality does not refer to any system of organization at all.

Hilariously wrong.

&gt; Again, entirely wrong for the aforementioned reasons. He is the one who came up with the idea that tonality refers to tones and thereby implies that atonal music must be "noisy." It's an insult that he came up with in the first place, nobody else. For any other person, atonal means lacking tonality.

Which aforementioned reasons exactly? I reject that he commits the etymological fallacy. You have stated he is wrong multiple times, but not really given me any reason. 

This is not his idea, he is describing how it has been used. Tonality as referring specifically to western functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is a very common understanding. Still most of the time you see the distinction tonality-modality. 

&gt; In other words, it's historically-revisionist 

No, he is quite conscious of history. But modern scientific metalanguage should not be constrained by historic use (that would be the etymological fallacy), but strive for clarity and the ability to make clear distinctions. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>&gt; In m8, for example you have an F chord descending in the right hand, while the left hand is playing…a fragmented C7 chord with a D thrown in as a…pedal tone?

That would simply be a d minor 9 chord add 6. Honestly nothing odd about the <b><u>harmony</u></b> there, rather it's the meandering right hand which makes the whole not work. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>You say that this piece is older, but I'll try to give some advice based on it anyway. 

* On notation: from the beginning in the compound time of 9/8 the 8ths should definitely be tied in groups of three. Having individual 9th notes like this is sometimes done in vocal scores. However, this is not just aesthetic as it would make reading the 3+3+3 easier. 

* Add slurs! As of right now all your strings are playing detache constantly. But I'd assume the woodwind lines and string-lines from bars 7 and 9 for example should be flowing and legato. 

* I think you rely on the harp a bit too much. It's standard orchestration advice for beginners to not overuse the harp. Mostly because most composers are keyboardists and the harp can play keyboard parts to an extent - has a similar logic. There are times in this piece where the harp slow arpeggio dominates with a melody and a bass-line only. (From bar 10 for example) This is a rather sparse sound for an orchestra. Try to delegate some aspects of the orchestra to fill in the harmonies from the middle. Further you can re-distribute the arpeggiated accompaniment across instruments to vary up the constant harp we hear. (Maybe pizzicato strings, but also you could simply use sustained notes in brass-woodwinds for example) It becomes monotonous pretty quickly. 

* There are some notes in the melodic lines that simply feel like wrong notes. I'm pretty sure that the f natural in bar 8 with the bassoon is a mistake, since the <b><u>harmony</u></b> contains an f sharp, it clashes pretty badly. Something sounds off in bar 9 and 10 as well. Bar 20 is again suspicious. Maybe you are trying to make the line more colorful, but some of those accidentals seem to be slightly off. 

* The melody in general could use some work. To this kind of slow and simply accompanied piece I would try to come up with a really memorable theme. As it stands the lines are sort of meandering. 

* I really enjoy that you finally give a more lush full texture from bar 23. Some neat harmonies from there on, though the problems with melodic lines sort of continue. 

* The ending of your piece to those high G's on woodwinds sounds very gentle on your playback. The reality will be quite different. It will definitely not be ppp on the oboes, clarinets or even the bassoons. You have to take to account that on actual wind instruments playing very high notes takes quite a bit of strain and energy, which is felt. Controlling the pitch gets pretty difficult and thus control over dynamics as well. The clarinets and oboes particularly will shriek here. [Here's a good video on high notes of the oboe for illustration.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-fCwZEaxIc&amp;t=271s) Really for the very soft and delicate ending with harp you only need the flutes, the clarinet CAN support with G5. 

In general a lot of promise harmonically. And certainly this type of slow moving, compound meter piece in fact fits well with this foresty fantastical theme. You have a sort of thematic element in your orchestration and approach down here. Could use a lot of work to make it more lush (fill out middle harmonies, don't leave harp alone) and in particular making melodic lines engaging. 

Some scores for study from this sort of pastoral calm lush writing with emphasis on string and woodwind melodies, I'd recommend you score read some works of the English late-romantic composers, such as Vaughan-Williams, ( [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR2JlDnT2l8) - [score](http://petruccilibrary.ca/files/imglnks/caimg/2/2c/IMSLP21575-PMLP49679-Vaughan-Williams_-_The_Lark_Ascending_(orch._score).pdf) ) or [Delius] (Video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojEiAF9HCFI) - [Score](http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/e/e0/IMSLP112201-SIBLEY1802.15791.1e22-39087009437239score.pdf) ) 

See how to vary accompaniment and maybe take some ideas from their melodies. 

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I imagine monody appearing and basso\-continuo parts with melody becoming very popular had something to do with it in the early 17th century. This enables more thinking in terms of melody and chords and encourages harmonic thinking over the earlier styled thinking of modes and cadences that guide the movement of individual voices, from which <b><u>harmony</u></b> emerges. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Hello!

With cases like this where a person is starting out learning the craft, it's pretty hard not to give sort of general (and sadly a bit) condescending advice on learning the basics of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, harmonization of a melody and studying a lot of scores and listening to a lot of music you like with an analytical ear to discern forms of the piece and how melodies are made to work. 

There are quite a few oddities with the score - you say this piece is for violin, cello and piano, but I see 3 violins and cello in the score, arranged quite oddly. It would generally be piano-violin-violin-violin-cello. Also a lot of clean-up is needed with some unnecessary stuff, like piano left hand at bar 17 and the repeated mp-s that follow. 

Beyond that level, I'd say the biggest thing that makes this piece into sort of a mess is that the melodic and harmonic frameworks don't support one another. You actually have a lovely melody in there at points, but it does not seem that you harmonized it, but rather came up with harmonic material independently and that harmonic material is often quite weird and I'm not sure it's in an intentional way. 

For example even at the third bar the right hand of the piano starts it's accompaniment figure on non-chord tones (6th and 4th to the root). The melody often rests on non-chord tones and also often clashes with the material in the second violin. (For example the long notes on e flat in bar 5 and so on) 

Now I'm not here to tell you that you can't use dissonance in your music. I'm all for it and we live in the 21st and not 18th century, I'm a huge proponent for dissonant music. Go listen to Schoenberg and Saariaho. But here the effect I feel you are going for clashes with the use of a lot of unresolved and unsystematic use of dissonance. Think through which tones you use in each bar and what the right hand of the piano and the second violin are doing. Think how the intervals used there support or clash with the melody. In general learning some principles of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, counterpoint and harmonizing a melody might be huge help to your development. 

The melody itself is at points ear-grabbing, from bars 4-6 and from bars 13-16. In between those sections it gets a aimless and the odd rhythmic accentuation and syncopation (especially the 16th offbeat) doesn't help with that. There might also be a little too much going on at all times - the piano right hand and the 2nd violin - sometimes it's good to leave your theme some space, especially if it's doing more complex stuff rhythmically. But mainly the "busy" and disjointed feeling of the composition comes from the harmonic clashes and lack of voice leading. 

And one thing that has become my pet peeve with beginner composers here it seems: piano chords in second and third octaves in close voicing. I don't think it sounds good done so ubiquitously. Check piano accompaniments from classic literature and I think you'll see that they prefer octaves, 5ths and 6ths in the 2-3 octave and leave the thirds to upper parts of 3 and 4th octave. 

Thanks for sharing your work! I hope my advice is of some help. 

</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>I see that you were actually talking about the 17th and 18th century.   


Well, you'll still find that most people would disagree. Yes in the transition from baroque to classical period polyphony was mainly substituted with homophony, but that does not necessarily mean the loss of complexity. You asked in another comment why focus on melodies developed \- difficult to answer, general cultural trends have numerous reasons for developing, but one thing that a focus on single melody allows is a renewal of musical forms and narrativity and transformations of the themes. Musical forms get more complex and free after the baroque, the sonata\-allegro develops, later on free\-er forms that focus on transformations of themes. <b><u>Harmony</u></b> also becomes more and more complex throughout the classical and especially romantic period, more dramatic contrasts are employed, more massive pieces are composed. And polyphony never actually disappears, you'll find it voice leading of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you'll find contrapuntal textures in most complex orchestral writing. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Generally speaking impressionist <b><u>harmony</u></b> uses a lot of 7 chords, 9 chords and so called polychords (think for example combined C major and D major triads); modal scales, non-functional progressions such as abrupt modulations for color, using odd chords over a pedal tone or so called planing - which you can most clearly see in Debussy's Sunken Cathedral - triads or even 7 chords moving totally in parallel motion. Add to all this quart-quintal chords, of course. 

Don't be afraid of googling something like "Ravel analysis". Guaranteed you will find a bunch of essays, doctoral dissertations, maybe even books that analyze his works, Ravel being such a studied composer. Even though these works can have an academic and dry language, read a bit and I'm sure you can take something away from them. From my cursory search I found these: 
[1](http://www.macromusic.org/journal/volume4/07_Musical_Insights_Vol_4.pdf) - harmonic analysis beginning in p.66

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>It's really pretty. I thought the engraving looks really nice as well. 

Slight constructive criticism in regards to the composition that strikes out to me as a thought I could give for further improvement.- It all sounds very good, but lacks the finesse of the best romantic piano music at this point. If I were to improve on this rather good base you have here, it is really a focus on a very memorable and good theme. After all, the melody was king of this type of music. There is a reason the accompaniment often stayed simple and spacious, without drawing too much attention to itself - to give even more and more space to the theme. 

I feel that when you composed this you had the <b><u>harmony</u></b> mapped out, the accompaniment pattern mapped out and the notes you want to land on at the start of each bar mapped out, but sometimes what happens in the middle isn't too important. Just some arcing figure in 16ths. When this happens in multiple bars in a row, the melody loses it's strength. 
 
I think I recognize this, because I've come up with compositions with the same problem, when I sort of compose a melody on top of a pattern and <b><u>harmony</u></b>. In this type of music, the melody should be the absolute lead. In performance it usually dictated the rubatos-dynamics and was usually played slightly out of sync with the accompaniment. So this type of piece will really-really start to shine when I don't get this sense that the melody is stepping along with the mapped out changes in <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>According to my <b><u>harmony</u></b> prof, ii - V is way more common in classical style (Haydn, Mozart) than IV-V.
</p></li><li><p><b>MonthlyComposition</b><br>You have a very good knack for tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It felt pretty natural for the functional harmonic style, though I don't have the time right now to do a close look analysis. I like how you vary your accompaniment patterns! The one section I have doubts about are from bar 30-34 or so. There are not exactly clashes with the vocals, but in bar 31 a b natural preceedes a b flat in <b><u>harmony</u></b> quite closely and then again bar 33 ends in c minor without really tonicising it or modulating to it. There's some weird harmonic motion there.  


The vocal melody does not seem to be particularly integrated with the text. It sort of just goes through some figures in e minor. I think it could be more unified and memorable.   


I would have made some different choices in portraying the text in music, though. Particularly the contrast between fire and ice could have been exploited - I like how along with the word "fire" you intensify the accompaniment. When "ice" enters I really feel you should go for a contrasting pattern, maybe also register and harmonies.

One chord at a time, usualy I get the next in my head by listening to 2-3 chord changes before it, and just type it in. 

I do actually think of them as individual voices. I change the bass and soprano first. Then I look at the former note of the alto for instance, and see what the next logical step would be for it, according its preceding pattern and what <b><u>harmony</u></b> I am hearing in my head.

I wanted to create tension, and so I create some dissonance by adding the leading tone earlier than usual, and the small second interval stuff, which comes from listening to alot of choral works. Alien phallic.

Studying music theory probably wouldn't hurt, it helps you understand a lot more when it comes to music. Try this site: www.musictheory.net

For actual composition, the best book for beginners is probably William Russo's Composing Music: A New Approach and here is a link to it: http://www.mediafire.com/?zmttjy2zdjn . It's pretty straight forward, but isn't so great for anything more than pop or jazz music (they're similar imo).

For classical music, which I'll assume you're interested in if you're messing with Walter Piston's books, it's best to know <b><u>harmony</u></b>, counterpoint, orchestration and classical form. Walter Piston's book is pretty concise for <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but I'd suggest CH Kitson's Counterpoint for Beginner's over his counterpoint book (link: http://www.mediafire.com/?1izmmdotzzm) and I'd suggest Rimsky-Korsakov's text over Piston's as well (link: http://www.northernsounds.com/forum/showthread.php/45270-Welcome-to-the-Garritan-Interactive-PRINCIPLES-OF-ORCHESTRATION-by-Rimsky-Korsakov).
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>Arnold Schoenberg's "Fundamentals of composition" http://www.mediafire.com/?lhtb8v8sbq5gj4h Especially read the part on theme and variation if you wish to write for films.

Walter Piston's "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>" http://www.mediafire.com/?0afmz3ozjzq Studies a lot of Romantic era harmonies you may find in 20th century film music.

CH Kitson's "Counterpoint for beginners" http://www.mediafire.com/?1izmmdotzzm Counterpoint is generally considered a necessary skill for film composers, so here's a book to get you started.

Rimsky-Korsakov's "Principals of Orchestration" http://www.northernsounds.com/forum/showthread.php/45270-Welcome-to-the-Garritan-Interactive-PRINCIPLES-OF-ORCHESTRATION-by-Rimsky-Korsakov

Salzer and Schacter's "Counterpoint in Composition" http://www.4shared.com/document/_7F2sKi5/Salzer_Schachter_Counterpoint_.html The strongest music book about academic I've personally read, I haven't tested this link though.

That should get you through for a while...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Do you mean sevenths as in dominant chords?

You can use sevenths very safely in even the most strictest 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> exercises if you pass them off as suspensions, that is a fourth species counterpoint sort of thing. If not, there are plenty of other figurative dissonance techniques you can use, like rhythmic displacement and note contractions.

Bach's one of those composers who had a thoughtful reason for almost everything he did. I don't believe he ever used sevenths by accident, he was amazingly good at what he did.

BTW, I take no responsibility for whether your teacher agrees with these techniques or not and he may fail you. It's probably best to ignore me and ask your teacher how to do it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Using chord tones, especially when there's a <b><u>harmony</u></b> included in the music, creates a sort of "right" feeling. This is why some people advise people to mostly use chord tones for melodies and then use other notes sort of like to decorate or add to the melody.

Also, dissonance in this day and age is a bit weird. Diminished chords were actually very acceptable in the 17th century, but these days seventh chords are almost used as consonant. I've also found using too many notes, or too much chromaticism, sounds more "wrong" to a post-modern listener than a pre-modern listener than extended chords, modern here meaning generally the 20th century.

As a suggestion, maybe try to add some phrasing to your lead part? Try making notes that appear on the first beat longer by removing the notes after it and tell me how that sounds to you.
</p></li><li><p><b>shareyourmusic</b><br>Thanks for the advice and attention, but I know the mixing is crap, specifically using filters/equalisation to balance the instruments. I get particularly lazy with it on this track https://youtu.be/dGcuXV5Sqxc has a REALLY badly mixed cello, the motivation is about a debate where one side did badly and had this weak but overly aggressive argument, so I deliberately mixed it badly whilst using large leaps to embolden it in places.

This track https://youtu.be/ZUs166X7GOs is just a mess.

Again, I'm not interested in production, that's a dark art to me that I expected to come later (but only got worse). I'm interested in how you commented about the panning, I did pan things in a way, certain instruments are always left panned, others are always right panned and drums are always centre pan. 

&gt;one thing that striked me the most was the four note motifs that he used. Those notes would be stuck in my head for days! 
Thanks, but this is really difficult to do with my style, I'm really focussing on <b><u>harmony</u></b> and it sort of limits what I can do with melody. I'd say Bach is a greater influence on me than Beethoven as https://youtu.be/Kdkmf9mV-K4

Anyway, I outright hated the last track I published so much. It was so horrible it doesn't get a mention, but somehow has more "likes" than any other? Especially on other social media sites. After that, I quit. I don't understand what I can contribute to music if I can contribute anything at all, I have a feeling the community feels it'd be best if I rather didn't.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hey, very personal question.

My order is this
1. Key, not scale or "mode" but key
2. Some sort of melodic thing
3. A simple two voice <b><u>harmony</u></b> based off it^ if it's simple it's like a cantus firmus, if it's complicated I have to analyse it for important, prominent notes
4. The cadence
5. The other voices of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>
6. Counter melodies to the original melody, always based off of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>
7. The song form, mixing and the dynamics of the piece, stuff sorted out in my DAW better discussed in /r/wearethemusicmakers

Just before you criticise, I'm employed as an engineer. Having a highly structured process and still finding a way to be creative is what I'm paid to do. You really, seriously don't need to follow this and probably shouldn't.

I think the coming elections are definitely not about independance, but about getting rid of the overly corrupt liberals.  However, I also think that a lot of people will vote PQ knowing that it is a lesser of 2 corrupt evils, and will do so only to kick Charest out. I would love to see the country of Québec, but never in a million years with the actual state of corruption we are living in.  Marois is just as opportunistic as Legault, and she would make a terrible leader for a country.  Plus, if the yes won at a referendum, I trully hope we would get to vote for our new government as a country, and not have to be led by the PQ by default.  So new parties with new agendas would arise to fit the realities of the country of Québec in the world and continent we live in.

That being said, to answer your question, if the country of Québec reveilled itself to be shitty, I would get involved to make things better, because this is my home, and it is far from perfect, but still I would not let biggots and racists destroy it.
And finally, regarding the economy, I do not know a lot of companies who would cut themselves of a market of more than 7 millions customers because, well I don't even know why they would do that. Fear of the unknown? Racism? It would be far too emotional a reason for economy anyways. Everyone knows english is the universal business language.  I talk in english at the office, yet I speak french at home and with my friends?  I don't make s fuss about it, my anglophone colleagues accept that i sometimes talk to them in french.  We have bilingual conversations and no one cares. And that is what makes the beauty and uniqueness of Québec.  The francophones and anglophones living together in <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  Anyone who thinks there is no room for two co-existing languages ( both ways) is not an open-minded person. And it is not because I work in english that my kids will not learn french and pass on our culture and tradition. We have to be proud of ourselves for who we are as a collectivity; we must not hide in the woods hoping no one will come and "corrupt our pure language" and exterminate our culture or whatever french extremists might say... that is just silly talk.

For a first piece, this is a very high complement.

What I don't like: the piece develops by adding layer after layer. Naturally this only works if each part doesn't change too much. This gives a piece cohesion, and gradually increases intensity as it go's on. This is with one problem, it doesn't develop the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or any of the other parts as it go's on. In Classical music the form closest to this is theme and variations, where you add variations as it go's on, but just adding layers gets boring after the third time. I would recommend changing up the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, adding passing and neighbor chords. Study up on basic <b><u>harmony</u></b>(watch seth monahan's videos) and counterpoint.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I spent several months studying advanced theory(starting with fundamentals, like counterpoint and classical period <b><u>harmony</u></b>) and was able to write a piano sonatina first movement in one day better than anything I have ever written when I spent weeks on(minus sleep, or time not spent composing). 

&gt;but the aspect of writing that I enjoy the most is the sound design (entails everything from selecting sounds for percussion, to making serum presets I like)

Don't use this as an excuse like some people do (a-hem, /r/wearethemusicmakers) for not learning literally anything else. <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, Counterpoint, Form, and Melody will take you miles beyond Timbre. Don't stop what you enjoy doing, but don't not study these things.

&gt;concerning **any** aspect of **producing** good music

Look up Seth Monahan's <b><u>harmony</u></b> series. Eventually youtube recommendations will give you some other things. For books I recommend Arnold Schoenberg's books. 

&gt;"and conveying specific moods (using modes and specific intervals)"

What you like and what you consider your style changes with time. Me before theory and after theory is not comparable in style whatsoever, and I doubt you won't radically change as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I recommend learning things in this order: basic music theory(basic diatonic <b><u>harmony</u></b>, chords, sheet music, memorizing the major scales, you know, highschool stuff), then going on to basic counterpoint(try alan Belkin's series, although both of them are good), and then go into intermediate <b><u>harmony</u></b>(Keyboard style), Ear training(tondear), do more counterpoint(try actually doing the exercises), advanced <b><u>harmony</u></b>(Chorale style), Melodic Construction, Form, Orchestration/Sound design, advanced counterpoint, and then finally , more advanced <b><u>harmony</u></b>(Neo-riemannian theory), then finally set theory. This isn't in order of how advanced it is, but how one thing will aid in something else.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Own the Structural Functions of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. Slightly hard to understand because Schoenberg could've worded a lot of things he said a lot better since English is not his first language, and also because how he uses roman numerals is not the least convoluted of ways.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I would like to write my own songs (contemporary)

contemporary as in modern or Contemporary as in Contemporary? If the latter, I would recommend 20th century <b><u>harmony</u></b> by Vincent Persichetti.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>&gt;"like the only idea i have is that the string play it in unison and it's a simple, repetitive rhythm which makes it easy to catch onto but halp pliz what write"

That isn't a characteristic of the Romantic era. If I were you, I would look at the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;"My main goal with this is to learn how to make better chord progressions."

Although you should definitely learn this, it is important to remember music theory=/=<b><u>harmony</u></b>. <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is part of music theory, but it is much bigger than that. Learning melodic structure, form, and counterpoint are all important too.
</p></li><li><p><b>Animemes</b><br>No it isn't, Kpop doesn't use the same harmonic conventions, form, and is much closer to american pop music than Jpop is. Jpop tends to be much more complicated and modulates at least once per song, while kpop tends to stick to simpler <b><u>harmony</u></b> and stays in the same key. Also lots of melodic patterns are all over jpop but absolutely nowhere in kpop.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>But in the process you can give somebody a wrong opinion on something that would've taken you like one more paragraph to talk about avoiding parallels in non-contrapuntal music. Especially because your claim was that "parallels are only avoided in music comprised of independent melodies." when it is also avoided in music not comprised of independent melodies for other reasons (being that the perfect fifth is kind of a bad interval for most things and sounds pretty weird unless it is at the center of your <b><u>harmony</u></b>).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;"It's a useful skill of you want to analyze music that isn't based on tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> (triads) because it gives you ways to describe chords that don't exist in traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b>"

You can also use it for tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> (also seventh chords are also tertian, along with ninths etc. Tone clusters are not tertian(although one can make an argument for modal tone clusters), and neither are quartal chords, and really weird chords often found in dodecaphonic music or free music).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well obviously traditional chord symbols are more efficient, it is important to state this. This is especially true when dealing with tertian music that traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b> doesn't describe(like Gesualdo)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b> is doing everything in classical <b><u>harmony</u></b> all at once.

If you cut off about half of Classical Music this is true.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Alan Belkin's Modern <b><u>Harmony</u></b> series on Youtube is a great introduction.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>&gt;makes the piano special

What makes the Piano Special is that you can play several notes at the same time at ease, and it's shortcomings(lack of timbral range, etc). Every instrument has dynamics. He does use extended <b><u>harmony</u></b> but he rarely starts out a piece in extended <b><u>harmony</u></b>. He also was the most Chromatic Composer until the age of Wagner.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>I think this is a bit entry level, and is missing some of the more important visualizations(like the functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> diagram(caplin), tonnetz, etc).
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Don't forget putting the basic motif in new places and in new <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Just realize that "do I have perfect pitch?" and "literally anything about negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>" posts are memes at this point.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I did it on an old account. I converted a few people and gave them the right resources to learn it(AKA not Rick Beato). I also saw some of the worst mental gymnastics since when I spent my time arguing about politics. There is a bit of a similar ideology here when it comes to talking about anything that isn't <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and the whole "music is 100% subjective" fiasco. It is generally much much better though.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;The guy clearly doesn't understand what music theory is then, because trap songs aren't "wrong".

I find it weird how they say that trap is outside of western classical music and cannot be analyzed through traditional means. For musical traditions which actually fit under that umbrella(although can be partially analyzed *form*ally, and still can be analyzed harmonically but only partially. When you count micro-tonal theory's it still can be analyzed) like Indian Classical Music, Traditional Chinese Music, Arabic Music, etc. it is somewhat offensive to. I totally agree with the statement that trap music isn't "wrong."

I also find the "Schenker would be proud" comment hilarious.

I start disagreeing with you when you say: "The backing chords to that song that they took from another artist (nine inch nails?) demonstrate some understanding of <b><u>harmony</u></b>." Taking chords from somebody else's song isn't quite proving an understanding of anything. Timbre is something that is theoretically understood by Music Theory alongside it's application, you just need to know where to look. Orchestration books although they don't make direct reference to sine-wave/saw-wave, do show understanding of the differences between the two alongside understanding the brightness of instruments.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>If you think of them as Piano Sonatas and less like String Quartets then it is easy to appreciate them. He does get inventive on his writing for the violin/cello, and they aren't always playing. Since I love watching score videos I would love to have much more so I can fully appreciate these masterpieces. I personally much prefer Haydn to Mozart (/u/badtemperedclavier is probably going to type a pseudo-intellectual PhD dissertation upon me saying this). Mozart includes more Chromaticism in his <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but his theme groups tend to be further related to one another. Haydn has more structural unity than Mozart and Beethoven, much closer to Bach.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>Putting Mozart above Bach is just wrong. Chopin's minatures do develop, they just don't develop much because they are shorter pieces. The thing about Chopin is that he pushed music further along in <b><u>Harmony</u></b> while Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven pushed music along through development of development. I don't think you think Haydn isn't underrated, but you do think Mozart is better than Haydn. To me, Mozart added a few sharps and flats here in there to change up a piece while Haydn would mess with it's form, maybe it's dynamics. I also do not disagree with you that Beethoven and Chopin are overrated.

The reason why people put Bach above every other composer is that he was the undisputed master of Counterpoint, of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, and of developing ideas. Bach was the originator of ideas like the eight bar sequence(*"So we see that even in the fullest and purest musical structure we can find quite simple forms. Everything that came after Bach was already prepared for. Not even in Haydn and Mozart do we see these two forms as clearly as in Bach. The period and the eight-bar sentence are at their purest in Bach; in his predecessors we find only traces of them."*), Developing Variation is also within his Art of Fugue. I don't think that Mozart really compares, or any composer at all.

Another thing you should note that some composers are just the absolute masters of certain aspects of Composition. Ravel with Orchestration, Schoenberg with Development, Berg with imbuing extra-musical meaning within purely musical works, and Bach with (almost) everything else. Chopin also the most pianistic composer, and did things that composers before him couldn't do. He revolutionized texture and used the pedal to such an effect.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>&gt;You say you don't care about Ravel, Schoenberg, Tchaikovsky's opinions, but then I don't care much for your opinions either.

I said I do' care about Ravel's opinion. If you had ever seen a thread I am in the idea that I wouldn't give a shit about **Schoenberg**'s opinion is so far from the truth that it is preposterous.

&gt;As for your defense of Chopin Waltzes and Mazurkas, I could make an argument about how each and every one of Beethoven's bagatelles develop like how you do with Chopin's.

You were claiming they had simple formatic structure, and didn't develop. I explained why that was wrong. I never said Beethoven didn't develop.

&gt; don't think it's appropriate to keep going at great lengths on this topic here, (you didn't start the thread for this, did you?) but I will say this, there are plenty of 'Romantic music fans' around this sub who don't even care about late 18th century music in general, calling it trivial shit, (according to them, Mozart and Haydn are both shit) while being extremely tolerant about Chopin's faults.

This is something I do agree with you on, except I am not one of those people. I personally consider the developments happening in the 19th century to be somewhat trivial until the high romantic era. Complicated <b><u>Harmony</u></b> existed in Bach very much, but the early Romantic Era was still important because of the Bach Renaissance. Mendelssohn saved music.

&gt;Paganini did for the violin like how Chopin, Liszt, Alkan did for the piano. But Paganini is never hyped up in the way Chopin is.

Yes he is, you clearly have never spoken to a Violinist.

&gt;I think part of the reason why this is because piano is so popular these days as a solo instrument and everyone likes sentimentality.

Because it is easier to make now and is undoubtedly the best solo instrument. With Violin and Guitar you are limited in your range, and how many notes you can play at a time. You cannot really accompany yourself on these instruments near as well as on Piano, nor can you play as contrapuntally. Because Pianos got cheaper, they became more accessible. This actually happened in the high-romantic era, not "these days."

&gt;People hype Chopin all the time about how he revolutionized piano technique, but in fact that was expected for his time. The 19th century was when solo piano and solo violin started becoming flashy.

And why did that happen?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Form, how to structure a piece, how to analyze the structure of somebody else's piece, etc. You should be able to know the purpose of aspects of a piece, how they contribute to the piece. You should know the meaning terms like developing variation, motif, theme, and section. You should also know <b><u>harmony</u></b>, voice leading, and counterpoint. You should also have competent ear training. I would consider all of this a good *bass* for any musician, since everything mentioned will come up in all music.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>What are your influences for this piece? It reminds me more of soundtracks to anime music than it does to Romantic, Baroque, Classical music. The descending bass-line over extended <b><u>harmony</u></b> is quite similar to Hisaishi, alongside the parallel fifths.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>i-v6-vi7-iii6-iv creates a feeling of melancholy by descending by step while remaining in a minor key without using any major chords. Generally a iv6 would be used instead of the vi7 but it makes sense here because the iii6 should be adjacent to a vi chord. I don't see anything wrong here, in fact the A section of this piece feels very strong(while technically *weak* is the harmonic strength, but that is in terms of resolution(weak vs strong), not in terms of quality).

Why I say this sounds a bit like anime music to me is that it doesn't resolve ever. It still uses functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> so it doesn't sound like Debussy or Modal Jazz, it has this exact sound. I like how well this piece captures it actually, but you definitely can improve in terms of developing this piece.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If I were you I would actually start by learning what he thinks about tonal music in *Theory of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, Structural Functions of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, and Fundamentals of Music Composition.* I would also read the *Path to New Music*(webern) if I were you. Everyone else gave you good resources on the 12 tone row. The reason why I think you might want to start on his other books is that the logic behind how he understands tonality and form carries on into the 12 tone technique.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>He makes important relations between the two concepts. I also believe that OP would like hearing his opinion on Tonality as well. I would say that the *Path to New Music* is probably the best introduction. The main reason I consider his writings on tonal music to be important for understanding his 12-tone music is because they are important for understanding Schoenberg. *The Structural Functions of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>* is also important because it shows us why he felt the need to escape tonality, and it helps us understand the free period much better.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes. Look up Alban Berg's Piano Sonata. I highly doubt your piece really is that far away from tonality. There in fact is an entire book answering our question: *Structural Functions of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>* by Arnold Schoenberg. Essentially Modulations are merely a deviation; they don't abolish Tonality. Using Chords not inside your key is called mode mixture and is a form of Extended Tonality, not Atonality. A lot(most of it) of Atonal Music doesn't even use chords you could put Roman Numerals on.
</p></li></ol></div><hr><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">User: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/nuclearslurpee>nuclearslurpee</a><ol><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Strictly speaking, it is a D# major chord. However, harmonically that's all it really is - it doesn't serve a tonal harmonic purpose, and just happens to be part of the 1 - ♯3 - 3 - 2 - ♭2 - ♯7 - 1 chromatic stepwise motive which is being played in opposition to the first motive in the bass (6 - 5 - 1).

The Prelude in general eschews tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> almost entirely, in favor of heavy chromaticism and a lot of stepwise motives (typical for post-Romantic/modern work), so don't sweat the details of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> too much.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I can't think of a specific use of this particular progression, but it does work on the kinds of harmonic principles that Wagner and others would have used.

Essentially, the progression is analyzed functionally as

    C:  I IV ♭VI | ♭II
    D♭:      V/I |  I  IV ♭VI | ♭II
    D:                    V/I |  I  etc...

Both V -&gt; I and I -&gt; IV are pretty standard and go by circle-of-fifths, but the IV -&gt; ♭VI does not. Instead, this is an example of chromatic mediant harmonic motion - essentially, two chords share a common tone and have chord roots a third apart (i.e. a mediant relationship) - which is an ubiquitous device in Romantic-era music, particularly the style associated with Liszt, Wagner, and so forth. It's not tonally functional in the traditional sense but works due to very smooth voice leading and the common chord tone. Due to the lack of traditional harmonic function this tends to provide a fairly ambiguous feeling to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> as opposed to the clear sense of direction that a typical tonal progression like IV - V - I does.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; Then, talking about "modal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" often leads me to sources like here and here which discuss its applications in jazz and folk music, which I think either aren't very applicable to me due to their focus on folk and jazz music as opposed to classical music, or I don't entirely understand the idea of "playing with the tone colors of specific modes".

That's largely because "classical" music, in the strict sense, doesn't really fit with the concept of modality. This isn't to say that there isn't "classical"-era music that uses modality, but the traditional functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> of common-practice music, on which traditional music theory is based, is built around the major and minor modes rather than the ionian-dorian-etc. modes - i.e. the focus is on subdominant/dominant/tonic relationships, leading tones, and all that. Folk and jazz don't limit themselves to common-practice approaches and thus modal <b><u>harmony</u></b> is more common in those genres.

That being said, you can certainly compose in a classical style with modes and modal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you just can't rely on common-practice harmonic theory to guide you. Try working with a procedure such as:

* Figure out what progressions "work" with the mode(s) you want to use. Generally speaking, the "color" of a mode is dependent on the location of the half-steps in the mode scale, so chord changes that highlight those half-step relationships are probably the most characteristic of the mode.

* Start with a melody line, then add a bass line following classical principles of counterpoint.

* Fill in the inner voices to create the chord structure you want, based on the progressions you want to use.

Hope this is helpful!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You certainly could do it either way, but it seems that most people find it easier to write the main line first rather than the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Additionally, from a practical point of view it can be easier to use the melody and bass counterpoint to provide direction rather than modal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, especially if the mode lacks a strong cadence - and usually, if you're writing in a classical style, you want your music to have a sense of direction and forward motion.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Spelling. If an interval spans three notes, it's a third, for example B to D spans B-C-D so it is a (minor) third. If an interval spans two notes, it's a second, for example A to B. In the case of A♭ to B, it's still a second because there's no other letters in between, but the interval spans three semitones making it an augmented second.

In many cases, such as dim7 chords, the distinction is academic and doesn't have any audible effect. In other cases, the distinction matters - usually from a functional-<b><u>harmony</u></b> perspective since the resolution of an augmented 2nd is different from the (usual) resolution of a minor third. For example, the resolution of a Ger^(+6) to a cadential i^(6-4), which is somewhat frequent in common-practice music, features the augmented 2nd resolving to a major 3rd (e.g. A♭ - C - E♭ - F# resolving to G - C - E♭ - G). Typically a minor third would not resolve to a major third in this way - it would be more idiomatic for a third to resolve upwards or downwards by step if you wanted it to resolve to another third, otherwise resolution to a fourth or fifth is more typical.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm writing out the notes in each chord below just to make sure that we're talking about the same chords, since I've seen a few different variations of some of those chord names:

    E G# B D# F#
    E G# B D# F#
    E G# B C# F#
    E G# B F#
    D F# A B E
    D F# A B E
    A F# A B E
    A F# A B E

If that's all correct, then you're probably in the key of E Major (or a mode with the same signature). The <b><u>harmony</u></b> does not look very "functional" to me, in a classical sense at least, but the root movement (E-E-E-E-D-D-A-A) suggests I-bVII-IV which, IIRC, is a substitution for I-V-IV. Either way, the last chord seems to want to resolve to E or maybe B, which is why E Major makes sense as the key.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If I might ask, how are you working out the chords? It might help if you could provide the context of the nearby chords as you've analyzed them.

I'm not terribly good at picking out chords by ear, but from listening and working off a tab it looks like the progression is

    C#sus F# D# C# AMaj7 C#7   F#Maj7
    Isus  IV II I  VIM7  V7/IV IVM7 in Roman numerals

So I don't find any CMaj7 chord here. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> doesn't look terribly functional, but can be understood in a vaguely tonal way.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think I can take a crack at this:

1. The second chord implies an A^b chord even though the fifth is missing. This is actually fairly common in three-part voicing since it allows flexibility by letting two voices double a chord note (if every voice must always play a different chord tone, the voice leading becomes very restrictive and plain).
2. One of the big general ideas in "classical" voice leading and <b><u>harmony</u></b> rules is that a chord in root position is a stable resting point, a chord in first inversion is unstable and generates momentum, and a chord in second inversion is dissonant and usually avoided. So a first-inversion triad (here, A^b / C is implied without the fifth) is "unstable" in the sense that it wants to resolve to a stronger chord/voicing. IMO, the choice of the word "dissonance" in the text here is a poor verbiage that obscures this idea.
3. Here, the dissonance really comes more from the second-inversion voicing of the A^b chord, which resolves into E^b. This is called a "cadential 6-4" (second-inversion triads are denoted by 6-4 in classical analysis).

Frankly, I think the text verbiage of "consonant/dissonant" is unhelpful, and particularly will be confusing as you look to more modern music where the concepts of consonance and dissonance are much broader and more powerful. It's more helpful to think in terms of which chords are stable resting points in a progression or cadence, and which chords are less stable (usually inversions) and provide momentum. With this understanding, the examples you've given are better understood as examples of how to resolve such progressions with good voice-leading.

On the other hand, with this frame of understanding you can also understand how to tweak or break these rules to good effect. For example, the progression 'C' could also be used to create a predominant-to-dominant progression that actually *increases* the instability before resolving it (to the tonic chord):

    Ab  Ab  G
    C   D   Eb
    C   Bb  Eb
    IV  V7  I

(Note again that in three-voice <b><u>harmony</u></b>, some chord tones are implied if not explicitly provided, and this is a common technique.)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm not much of a jazz theory guy, but this looks *kind of* like tritone substitution, where the dominant (D7) is replaced with the chord with its root a tritone apart (Ab). I'm not entirely sure what the Maj7 is doing, though. The Eb could be understood as a substitution for V/V and/or as a bVI of G major.

As for the Phrygian aspect, G-Phrygian shares a key signature with Eb major, which has EbMaj7 and AbMaj7 as diatonic chords, so there's some mode mixture going on there as well. However, GMaj7 is definitely not diatonic in G-Phrygian, so I feel like the turnaround back to G major "works" in part due to the resemblance of the Ab - G progression to a tritone substitution.

So in short, my best assessment is:

* G D Emin C is all diatonic G major <b><u>harmony</u></b>
* EbMaj7 is borrowed from G minor and also can be said to mix in the Phrygian mode.
* AbMaj7 can also be considered Phrygian mode mixture.
* Ab - G progression "works" due to its similarity to the tritone substitution even though the chords have Maj7 quality instead of MajMin7 and Maj quality.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Quick hits:

* The text is in error, it should read G-B-D-F (note the F in the oboe melody on beat 3).
* The fourth in strict classical <b><u>harmony</u></b> is only considered dissonant if the interval is formed with the bass note, which is why second-inversion triads are rare or "special cases".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>As a preamble, you'll want to make sure that your recording setup is giving you consistent good quality, since a poor sound quality will make anything sound bad.

The trick with creating "interesting" rhythms is to remember that the human ear will usually only be able to follow one "thread" of sound at a time, which will usually be the most rhythmically-active part. The active line can jump around between parts, or two parts can trade back and forth, but if you have multiple parts all trying to do something complex, the sounds will just muddle together and be uninteresting.

So a general idea for how to combine rhythms would be:

1. Create your main melody line, which probably has the main rhythmic interest. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can have two (or more) instruments trading off the line, but for starters it's simpler to just use one instrument.
2. Sketch out a simple bass line and possibly other <b><u>harmony</u></b> parts. Here you can establish a "harmonic rhythm" which is simply the rate at which the chords are changing and may be different from your meter (e.g. in 4-4 time the <b><u>harmony</u></b> might change every 2 or 4 beats, or a consistent two-measure beat pattern of 4-2-2, or something else entirely). Don't worry too much yet about filling in an interesting rhythm, get the <b><u>harmony</u></b> down first.
3. Beats where the <b><u>harmony</u></b> changes usually inform how you place your metric stresses - rhythm can be either in sync with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> or opposed to it. If you want to add drums or percussion, this is a good point to do so.
4. Returning to your bass line, you can start working out how it should sound rhythmically. One approach is to use a simple rhythmic figure that can be repeated without drawing attention. Another approach is to Play the main bass notes, and add connecting notes between each chord change (for example, if you change chords from Amin -&gt; Cmaj, you could have a bass line of A - - B C - - - with the '-' indicating to hold the note longer).
5. The remaining parts are usually the hardest to keep "interesting". Generally, think about how they can compliment the melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> rather than how they can be "interesting" on their own - all the parts have to work together. For example, if your bass line has a decent rhythmic feel, you could have a rhythm guitar line that has the same rhythm but plays full chords instead of single notes. You could have the rhythm guitar line consist of full chords played on each chord change with some connecting notes in between (like the bass line, but different). You could have the chords be arpeggiated in constant 16th notes. The key is to make sure that, again, the rhythm is simple and not going to draw attention from the melody.

I recommend looking at how music you like is structured for instruction and inspiration. For example, [the opening of "The Unforgiven" by Metallica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDzGy84VIoU) is a nice example of some of these techniques. The rhythm guitar starts with an arpeggiated figure in 16th notes, and then the lead guitar comes in after a few bars. Since the rhythm part is pretty constant, the ear is drawn to the new, more rhythmically-interesting melody line while the rhythm part provides harmonic interest with the mildly-dissonant arpeggio. When the bass enters, it outlines a simple line with some connecting figures between each chord change, but mostly accents the melody rather than competing with it. It's a nice buildup into the rest of the song where each part is interesting but different, and they all work together because each instrument plays its own role instead of competing with the others.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Bass notes determine the inversion, not the root. To find the root for traditional tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>, rearrange the chord notes into a stack of thirds. The bottom note of that stack is your root.

So for example, if I have a chord voiced as F D A F, then ignoring the doubled F I have D to F as a third and F to A as a third, so the chord in root position is D F A or Dmin. The F in the bass means that this is a Dmin/F i.e. the chord is in its first inversion.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's definitely not a traditional tonal-functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> in that section. I do think it's likely more for color than function.

However, I don't think it represents a modulation. Note that the bass line from mm.10-13 sketches an incomplete B major scale, which is the dominant. From this, I would tend to think of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> as an expansion of the dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b>, which is a fairly common idea in most common-practice composers' works (though implementations vary quite a bit). Note that from mm.10-11, the chord on Cb "resolves" like a Ddim (D to Eb/D#, F to Gb/F#, and Cb/B to Bb/A#). So one way to analyze the progression might be as vii^dim7 /iii - iii - I^9 in B major. Another approach would be to analyze the diminished chord as a common-tone dim7 (with B as the common tone) which doesn't hold the common tone.

Probably the best analysis though is to simply acknowledge that the harmonic function is secondary to the color, voice leading, and melodic line establishing an extended dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Music theory is descriptive, not prescriptive, and describes what composers usually do to make stuff sound good when they don't have any better ideas. Thus, I would consider this as a "better idea".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Usually, you're going to need separate textbooks for each of the main areas of importance for composition:

* <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and Form: some "Music Theory" textbooks cover these together, some only cover one or the other.
* Counterpoint
* Orchestration (i.e. how to combine instruments together well)

[This material by Alan Belkin](http://alanbelkinmusic.com/site/en/index.php/introduction/) might also be useful to you. It's not a substitute for a traditional textbook, but he does a nice job of recontextualizing the material you'll learn in textbooks for a more general approach to composition (e.g. without relying on traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b>).

Bbmin6 is the ivminor of Fmajor, one of the most common chord progressions in all of music.  A iv minor goes to it's I about 99% of the time in functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>....I usually refer people to the old standby "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" for an easy example.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br><b><u>Harmony</u></b> is going to help you with structure, you'll also be abled to analyze a piece of music you enjoy and figure out what makes it tick.  Learn Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, your common patterns, Secondary Dominants and modal interchange stuff.  <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is directly related to rhythm, you'll for instance notice what beats chords change on most often, etc.
Also, I recommend picking something you like and using that as a Model to build your own composition out of, don't worry about being a copycat at this point.  You simply trying to figure out how to write good pieces of music.  For example, take their chord changes and write your own melody on top of it.
Transcribe as much as you can and use the material you get via transcribing.  Songs teach you quite a bit of <b><u>harmony</u></b> on their own. 

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>No, if it were me I would just hire the best composition teacher I could find, online or in-person and work my tail off to get what I wanted.  This includes studying scores, writing, transcribing, studying <b><u>harmony</u></b>, anything that will make you a better composer.  You can become a better composer without school but not without the studying.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think you should compose right away.  At the same time, I do believe at some point to go further you need to learn about form, themes, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and such.  It can save you time so to speak, knowing what works and what works....on the other hand, a mind less filled with all of that can be quite creative.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I think you are viewing improvisation as something separate from composition when it fact it can be part of it.  People often forget that a lot of the baroque and classical composers improvised.  I guarantee you that's how they came up with the things they went on to write.
My suggestion is to RECORD your improvisations, listen back and find parts you like.  Use those to develop a composition out of.
I would also suggest taking some of the best melodies you know, analyzing them for content, how are they shaped?  How are they related to the <b><u>harmony</u></b>?  Use those as models to make your own melody.  It could be you are trying to create out of a vacuum and you have to put in materials in order to get something out.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Of Course, at the end of the day you are dealing with SOUND and you need to do everything you can to increase your ability to hear something and know what it is.  Better hearing will speed up the composing as well.  With the proper training I think you'll find this disadvantage disappears to some extent.  
If you want my opinion I think you are trying to do too much....piano/cajon/drums/guitar and all of those styles?  I would advise to pick two things at most and learn them well.  Piano is always good for composers, percussion would be too.  That covers your <b><u>harmony</u></b> and rhythm.  

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I will explain why I had the same problem:
1)The chords presented in books often give you lots of substitutions and discovering the underlying functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is difficult from both theory and aural perspective.  You need to start with basic structure and chords
2)Learn basic jazz progressions.  ii-V, Rythmn Changes, Circle of Fifths progressions.  A great deal of standards are highly predictable once you learn this stuff.
You could start with 12 bar blues, then rythmn changes then something from older era like Sweet GA Brown.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>At no point did I say it was someones obligation to do something "difficult"; however, by limiting yourself to playing/writing in one key then you won't be prepared for much that a professional music is called on to do.  

A lot of music I enjoy is actually quite simply....doesn't modulate, is made up of three chords.  So you read a lot into it that wasn't there.

I think there is a misunderstanding- Playing in only C major is not the same as modal jazz, minimalism, and drones.  

For example, "So What" and "Impression" are modal songs.  However, Coltrane and Miles Davis for example ran multiple modes, melodic minor, harmonic minor, and natural minor over a modal song....not to mention overlaying substitutions outside the tonal area.  Basically anyone playing over a modal song such as those uses a variety of sounds outside of only the mode.  There's a good reason for that. If you are confined to only a pentatonic pretty soon you've run out of ideas.  The knowledge of other material is what allowed them greater freedom and "innovation."  

From the same era "Passion Dance" for example is F and not D like Impressions.  So within the modal jazz world you have them using different tonal centers.  Sometimes switching for the A and B sections.  

Sure in practicing you get A LOT out of limitation and exploring one set of sounds.  Jamming out on D dorian for an hour is fun.  However, the moment somebody says C Mixolydian, you're dead unless you've practiced it.  Hence why I am arguing writing/playing everything in C major is a bad idea, especially for those with limited practice time.  

Minimalism-Once again, not always in a single key.  Sure people do that but they also don't always choose the same key for every composition.  Lots of minimalism pieces run through different tonalities.  There is a reason people don't compose every minimalism piece in C major.

Michael Torke is one of my favorite modern composers, he's wrote a lot in One key, great stuff.   Yet, he can also write a song with a complex <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  In fact, many of the people that play/write modal/minimalism music have a good understanding of <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  

Indian music is something that's more a long the lines of playing in a single "key."  Since they don't have to focus on the <b><u>harmony</u></b> they can expand the rhythm and melodic motifs....but that's why I said Western Music.  

I don't think many of history's great musicians/composers really thought about things the way you are advocating.   Trying to write and play everything in one key. Not Mozart, Bach, Duke Ellington, Sousa, Charlie Parker, Buddy Holly, Robert Johnson, Beatles nor Louis Armstrong.

Perhaps I've missed them.  Who are/were the musicians advocating playing/writing in only C major?

Lastly, I would beg to differ that what Beethoven did in his time was normal.  The whole reason he is remembered is because it wasn't normal.  The level of theme development and duration of it is partly why he is remembered....things he was able to do because he didn't sit around writing everything in C major. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>At no point did I argue that someone is obligated to push the envelope harmonically to be innovative.  

Some of my favorite music is three chords with no modulations, so you read a lot into it that wasn't there.

I was simply addressing your blank statement that efficiency drives innovation, when there are countless examples where that isn't the case.  What drove a great deal of innovation was people exploring all the possibilities.  Whole genres of music were created like this, not because they wanted to sit around playing in one key.   

Keep in mind many of things you mentioned were reactionary in some cases done by people who had taken <b><u>harmony</u></b> to it's limits.  Done by people that had already went through knowing their stuff.  It's one thing to do it for musical reasons and another to do it out of shere laziness which is what I see advocated on here quite often.  People don't want to be bothered to learn music so they take the easy way out.

Telling someone to learn only one key, how is that going to work out for them in a performing situation when somebody calls a key they never practiced or know anything about.  If somebody has an hour to practice every day, no way would I recommend playing only in one key.  A year from now they will not be able to adapt to much of anything. 

To address your point about modal/minimalism.  Playing only C major is not the same as modal, minimalism, for many reasons:

Take something like "Impressions" or "So What", Miles Davis and Coltrane did not play play only D Dorian on those songs.  They played D Dorian, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor, Pentatonics, as well as superimposed other keys.  It was their knowledge of that other material that gave them freedom to play over something like that for twenty mins.  If all they knew was a Pentatonic scale, despite the limitation, they would have ran out of steam.

Even in Modal music people do not use the same tonal/root.  "Passion Dance" for example is in F.  There are a number of modal pieces that shift roots/tonalities between the A to B or C sections.  Another reason to not only write/practice one mode.

Same goes for minimalism-there are a number of those pieces that shift tonalities through sections.

I think someone whose prime exposure to music is a piano roll in a DAW is going to think all keys are equal because they haven't been exposed to the nuances and unique resonances of the various instruments.  They are coming at it from a technology point of view and not one of actual real instruments.  If you go to play with real musicians you don't have a transpose button there to help you either.   

Beethoven was not doing something "normal."  Until that time nobody had the level and duration of development sections he had.   One reason they were of that length was due to the modulations,  keys were form markers.  

I don't recall Duke Ellington, Wagner, Beethoven, Chopin, Buddy Holly, Louis Armstrong, Coltrane, Bill Monroe, any great musician ever telling people to play/write in one key.  Nor did they do such a thing. The only place I have seen or read such a thing is on an internet forum.   
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think that the number of notes is a small part of the musical equation.  For example, lots of great melodies have been written with five notes.  We could have 100 notes but would that lead to "less boring" music? Perhaps or perhaps not, depends on the person using those notes.  This is why people are still writing hit songs and memorable melodies with only 12 available, they are using the same old basic sounds but in a new order.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> is another thing that's only part of the equation as well, a lot of music isn't sophisticated harmonically.  However, at this point, I'm not sure what's left to do with <b><u>harmony</u></b>, at least that's capable of capturing the average audience members ears.  The further it goes, the more you lose a lot of people.  

There has been an upswing in rhythmic complexity, multiple time signatures, polyrhythms and that of course will continue to be explored.  I think there's much to do there.  

Personally, I think an area with the greatest range of exploration is with instrumentation and arranging.  For example, sometimes instruments get confined to one or two genres.  Many attempts at these explorations come off wacky and bad but I do believe we aren't there with all of it yet.  

Don't forget timbre and dynamics.  Things that I think can be explored further.

In summary, I think a lot of new music could come from concentrating on things other than pitch alone.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are lots of teachers out there so you shouldn't have any trouble finding one, what do you want to work on?

I teach a lot of music theory and <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Given how long you've been playing and your interest of jazz guitar.  I would say counterpoint is lower on the totem pole.

At the same time, as someone that spent a lot of time as a jazz guitarist I will say learning functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and "blocks" of chords does miss some things.  Namely the idea of voice leading and thinking more horizontal as opposed to vertically.

Is it worth to sit down with a counterpoint book like the Fux?  That's something only you can decide.  

As a jazzer, you are already going to have to spend time learning things in multiple keys, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, learning vocabulary, scales, etc.  Counterpoint requires time and dedication.

You might be as well off to sit down and work your way through each part of Bach's Two Part Inventions to get ideas and see how it all works.  To play jazz well, you don't need an incredible understanding of counterpoint.  
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>While your endeavor is a good one, I think you need to also understand that even the great composers composed using "theory".  Theory can be as simple as what notes are in a C major Triad.  

Your melody should guide you to options if you know <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  Something as simple as let's say your melody has a C note in it, well what chords have that note.  What effect are you going for?  This starts to eliminate all of the options.  Knowing the key even tells you a lot.

I just think it helps to know that even the greats didn't sit there hearing polytonal chords in their head as they wrote.  It was a lot of theory plus trial and error.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>My process:

I draw out only the form, the number of measures.  This is usually four to a line (not always)....I don't try to fill in the chords or melody yet.  I am simply labeling the number of measures in each section and observing whether there are repeats, second endings, bridges, etc.  I note if there are unexpected odd measure numbers.

Next I write in all of the things I hear immediately, for example I-IV-V's.  I may make notes of "minor" chord.  I then go after all of the things that come easy to me, I don't work in order with the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  Working in order slows me down because I'll sit there and obsess about one measure and not get much done if it's difficult for me to hear..

Melody wise I work more in order.  If it's something I can't hear quickly, I analyze the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and see if it might tell me what the notes might be.  I make notes of themes, repeated fragments.

Sometimes I write it out in notation software, sometimes I do the most ridiculous things like write on the back of a scrap paper C E G F# Ab, and then put rhythm symbols under them for the melody.  Depends on how I'm going to use what I'm transcribing.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Well I learned my theory by studying what is called the Great American Songbook, songs by Gershwin, Kern, Young, etc....These songs teach a person how <b><u>harmony</u></b> moves and works.  My background was in jazz and not classical music.  The forms are much shorter and in some ways predictable.  Less Faster Modulations as well.

I've only been analyzing/learning classical forms for last year and half.  If I started with this, it would have been a bit daunting for me due to length of pieces.  

I dare say that <b><u>harmony</u></b> might be better to understand from music/songs that are simpler.  I've even seen some classical composers say learn how pop music works, because it's easier.  

Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is the topic you need to look into.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>While I do agree with the gist of what you are saying (heck half my responses are go transcribe, sing  and sight-sing), I will say that it has to be in balance.

I've seen people with incredible ears that could sing back complicated lines upon first listen who produced pretty boring music.  That's the weird thing about music, you would think if someone could hear something and know what it is immediately they could assimilate a TON of music really fast and they would end up producing something great....yet, there are countless people with incredible ears that don't.  It's the same reason not everyone with perfect pitch is a great musician.  Music skills are a complicated equation.  I liken it to a car with the best set of tires you can buy....without the other components it's not going to suddenly go a lot faster.

One of the main reasons I advocate learning by ear to my students is because at some point the memory bank runs out with repertoire/notes/etc.  The more you can depend on your hearing, the less you have to depend on memorizing.  At some point, you hear or hum something in your head and just know where the notes are.  Extremely important if you want to expand your repertoire beyond say 50 songs.  

Something like functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> liberates your hearing if you not only study it but use it to figure things out on recordings by ear.  Personally I didn't naturally have good ears, I had to work my tail off at it.  Without understanding functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> my ears would have reached a plateau.  The theory allowed me to go beyond. Theory was simply labels and by having nice little labels for things it can help me see and hear them.  An organization principle.

One problem I have with theory is it often does not accurately represent what is in the scores or recordings.  Which is why everyone should go to the scores or recordings to find the theory of the music they enjoy.

Anywhoo, In summary- Get your ears as far as they can go but realize that 10 mins a day with some ear training app isn't going to suddenly revolutionize your guitar or piano playing.  You have a lot of work cut out and it might be a while before you see the real benefits.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I teach <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, theory, and improv via Zoom online.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I just noodled it out on guitar for a second, some comments:

1)It's all diatonic.  No notes outside the key or modulations.  I get all of the arpeggiated figures and that was sound you were going for but at the same time, don't be afraid to play more than one voicing at a time, maybe some chord or dyad hits every now and then.  You have many strings with lots of potential.

2)Each "section" is simply too short, in other words you move on to quickly.  It's a common problem and one I still have myself at times.  Those first seven measures, without even playing through them I'm thinking why the change so quick to the different rhythm, did you explore those seven bars enough? If it got boring to you then go further harmonically or melody wise.  A constant thing I'm reminding myself of-if someone listens to your piece for the FIRST time, they are probably not as ready to move on from your initial material as you are the millionth time you've heard it :)

3)M11 through M17...The oblique motion is nice; however, the bass should move contrary sometimes in your piece.  It's moving too much in parallel with your melody.  Think about that melody going up while your bass moves down.  This might require making things more difficult to play.

4)Development (tied somewhat to # 2).  An EASY way to develop it is to simply sequence the material up.  So take whatever your melody is and move it up say a major 3rd, 4th, or a 5th and then put a new <b><u>harmony</u></b> underneath it.  I see a lot of possibility of starting your melodies on different beats, for example m. 17 is a goldmine.  Take the B to C part and move that around to starting on say beat 4 or beat 1 in another measure....I'm just choosing that, choose whatever is most important to your piece and move it around to different beats.  

In summary I think you would get a lot out of sequencing up some of your ideas, starting and ending them on different beats.  Taking one section and expanding it to at least 12 bars and modulating elsewhere for one section.  After you try this, repost (the composer reddit is a good place as well) and get more feedback.  It's the only way to get better.

Lastly, forget that judge ever said that and get back to work.  
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Normally I give detailed responses about why I feel the way I do...about melody/<b><u>harmony</u></b>/rhythm/texture.   

I dug where it was going but you lost my attention at the 3:00 mark.   

Around 5:00, I started enjoying it again.  Then you lost me again at the ending.

I think some of it was because I was craving silence for just a bit, it's a lot to take in :)
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Even if the piece is modal, I think you need to consider the musicians performing the arrangement.  Make it easy for them so they can play their best. 

Sure Roman Numerals indicate function but even in a non-functional tune you can use them to help with things like transposition/playing it in different keys.  Lots of Wayne Shorter tunes are not functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> but I can't imagine writing bass continuo for them.

Even basic folk rock tunes are sometimes modal but Roman Numerals would help in once again transposing them on the fly.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you are just interested in music theory I would save my money and get a cheap one.  The good news is there are A LOT of cheap MIDI keyboards.  I have a Nextar LX88, cost me $250, it's wonderful...you can get a smaller one cheaper.  No it won't play like a real piano but for what you are trying to do with your budget it doesn't matter.

The theory comes by doing, going over the exercises and ideas over and over.

For example if you want to know <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you could begin by sitting at your keyboard and playing V-I's in all 12 keys or expanding ii-V-I's and so forth.

If you went through the Great American Songbook material, let's say five songs playing only the chords and taking note of how they move numerically speaking you would learn a ton about <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  Having a bigger or more expensive keyboard wouldn't help you with either.  It's the doing, not the gear.

A lot of music theory is a mental exercise, you could sit with some sheet music, no instrument, write it out and learn quite a bit.  Singing is great for music theory too (even if your voice sucks :P), it allows you to internalize it.  For example, singing arpeggios and naming the notes in each chord.

I recommend getting a keyboard but I'd also say don't lose sight of what's available to you that'll help you become a better musician that doesn't involve much gear.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Here is an approach that I think is a common thread to a great deal of music:

1)CREATE VARIATIONS.

\-Take a melody to a piece or tune you already know and write as many variations as you can on it. Augment, diminish, expand, sequence, etc.  I'm sure you know the scoop.  This is great because you aren't having to invent a melody, it's already there.

Try to take those variations you created and play a game of mix n match.  So pieces from variation 1 and variation 3, mix var 2 and var 4, etc.  This way four variations quickly become actually ten  Maybe limit yourself to five good variations on 8 bars.

Every type of music I've learned involves the variation principle-Jazz, Bluegrass, Blues, Classical, Indian Music.  It's in all of them.

When Sonny Rollins is improvising for 20 mins on a jazz head, he is doing A LOT of theme and variations.  It's just a different style and going far away.  He is hearing the melody the whole time in the background though.

The problem many people have in the beginning is overwhelming themselves by thinking improv is some spontaneous/magical thing, and while it certainly can be, don't start with those expectations.  Make it doable.

Compose/write it out and practice mixing them all up.  Get rid of the idea that preparing a few things ahead of time doesn't make it improvising.

We improvise conversations all the time, using words we have used a million times, it's the ORDER that changes.  So take things prepared beforehand and you mix them all up.

2)WRITE A repeating BASSLINE (Passacaglia), limit yourself to FOUR BARS:

For example C-Bb-D-G (One bar each).  Let it loop and practice improvising and/or composing over it.  Don't even worry about chords/<b><u>harmony</u></b>.  Just make up melodies, see where your ears take you.

Here is one I threw together in a few minutes ( I'm not a piano player, I'm a guitarist/banjo player; I have "composer piano chops", lol but this is what I do for fun when I can't think of anything to write or play)

[https://youtu.be/bzfqT-uq\_7U](https://youtu.be/bzfqT-uq_7U)

Classical and jazz both had this principle- Improvising on a set chord/bass pattern.

3)TAKE SMALL FRAGMENTS (Scale degrees like 123 or 321) and learn those in as many keys as you can.  The goal is to get where you can play ideas in multiple keys quickly.  Then come up with a chord progression, let's say C-Dmin-G-C and improvise by limiting yourself to only three note fragments on each chord.  You'll find in order to make it interesting you have to change the rhythms (a good thing!)

You need Small/simple steps, not a bunch of complicated mess.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Let's take the key of Eminor.  The V is B7.  A regular 9 on that chord is a C#, So B9= B D# F# C#

The C# isn't in the key of E minor (one reason we change extensions, to fit the key, it's not only reason)...that C# simply doesn't pull you back to the Eminor as strong as a C (b9) or D (#9) would.  It wants to lead you into a D note.

Most of the time people will play a b9 or #9 on that five chord in a minor key if they need to add extensions.

Another reason B9 doesn't often work is that in older songs (30's and 40's) the iminor chord was actually a im6 (E G B C#) and not a im7....

If you put that C# in there it works like a leading tone pulling you strongly into a D, like you were going to an Em7 (E G B D) for the i, which is wrong on those old songs.

Try B7b9 or B7#9 to Eminor and then try B9 to Eminor, listen to the differences.  I think the theory of it all is more confusing than simply listening to the differences of sounds and taking notes of what others play.

As you get further away from functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> these things of course matter less but for functional material these are good "rules" to follow.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I think in order to properly prepare yourself, you need to start reading music notation every day and do your best to use it to notate your ideas.  Why not?

Sure there are lot of composers nowadays that don't write or read notation and just play in MIDI format.  However, I think for a degree the higher level those skills are at the better your experience is going to be.  I can't imagine trying to play catch up with some of it while at university, you'll already have enough to do.  Start working at least treble and bass clef each day.

Guitar players are known for not being good sight readers, so I'm sure they'll cut you slack.

At the same time, I've had a number of students throughout the years that wanted to go to music school.  Almost all of them never put forth the time and effort to get there.  Things we worked on-creating chord melody to jazz standards like All of Me, Just Friends, etc.  Learning all of our scales in every key.  They THOUGHT they wanted to do it but somewhere they became slackers.  

I am not sure what I would recommend with the piano, this is where the education people on the board are of more help then me.  I hesitate because if you start spending 30 mins a day at the piano, does that pull you away from getting basic required skills on your main instrument, guitar?  I"m blasting away at piano myself and meanwhile my guitar skills are decreasing...at the same time, there is no better instrument for seeing <b><u>harmony</u></b> and sight reading things.

What about your ear? Where is it at?  How much transcribing have you done?  Can you hear basic chord progressions by ear? What about melodies.

Lastly, somewhere will mostly accept you.  It depends on your goals, do you just want to go to music school.  How serious you are about it.  As one of the other posters stated, and I agree with, weigh your options.  Can you study composition privately and do something else at school?

As a pro musician I will tell you that being able to play solo guitar with lots of popular repertoire CAN pay your bills.  Hence why I tell students to keep up the performing if they want to make a living at this.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Quartet writing you are talking <b><u>harmony</u></b>/voicings.  You need to know basic line independence rules, bass moving in contrary motion to top line at times, etc.

I'll throw a different suggestion:

Take a melody you already know, it could be a folk song, national anthem, a hymn, anything that is short and sweet.

Arrange that for four part voice. 

The great part about this is you don't have to come up with a melody, it's already there so you can concentrate on your other skills.

Take it and create variations on it.  Write the same melody arranged a bunch of different ways.  Really milk it for all it's worth.

This is how I'm currently working on my orchestration, by separating it from composing a new melody I find I can better focus on possibilities.

I'll echo what someone else said, I don't always like this advice of write, write and write some more.  I know for me personally this advice didn't help me.  I spent a lot of time writing but wasn't getting any better.  Without someone to tell me what I was doing wrong, I'd still be writing the same crap.  You need a feedback mechanism, a mentor, It will save you LOTS of time.

Modeling:  Take something that has already been done, a short piece once again.  Use it as a model and write your own piece using ideas from it.  You could take a Bach Chorale and say, okay he moves his bass this way or the soprano does this.  Go back to your piece and do the EXACT same thing (using different notes of course).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Given what you've posted, here is my opinion-don't waste your time with it (it pains me to say that, haha)

You said you aren't interested in classical and are more interested in popular stuff.

Counterpoint is great but  it seems like you aren't very interested in it and what you like isn't using it very much.

I think you have to pick your musical battles with limited time available.

I think you'd get a lot out of learning Great American Songbook songs because of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, studying things like quartal voicings, pentatonic superimposing, from maybe a more jazz perspective if you are simply looking for more options.  Improvising and <b><u>harmony</u></b> based ear training is what I would focus on.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I would say no for a number of reasons.  Firstly, The charts in the book have all the changes written out, including the ones the composers didn't write.  In some cases, the wrong ones as well.  

I think you need to understand functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> so you can weed through all the chords they have listed and relate them to how people actually hear sections of harmonies.  This allows you to think like a jazz player, adding substitutions/changing each time you play, rather than some set in stone form of a song.

I always reduce the songs in that book down to their simplest forms for my students if they want to learn from it.  For example, Tonic/Dominant/etc. Then demonstrate the different things someone can do through the Dominant sections, etc.

My advice, pick something easier like "All of Me", grab an Ella or Frank recording and learn the words or melody to the point you can hum it or sing it away from the instrument.  Then try to play it on the piano by ear.  Perhaps start with a Blues or an older swing song like "Lady Be Good" or "Sweet GA Brown."

Attempt to learn chords by EAR first, using a lead sheet as a key to see what you didn't get or couldn't hear.  

Try to learn the chords to the songs in multiple keys.  It's a ton of work at first but will greatly accelerate the process as you get further into it.

In summary, engage your ear as much as you can.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are a number of ways to look at it

1)How much do the pitches move around, is it mostly steps or are their leaps?  Does it go up and down, this is know as the contour of the line.  Locate the highest and lowest points, where do they occur in time?

2)You can analyze the notes in relation to the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  This tells you if the composer was thinking Chord Tones, arpeggios, etc.  

3)What are the non-chord tone notes, how long are they held for?  Where do they occur in the line

4)What are the themes or motifs?  A common one is for the composer to sequence a melody up and use it again over a different <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

5)What are the most used notes in the melody? 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>If you are thinking more industry then you need to master working in a DAW and be able to work very fast. Not to mention incredible mixing skills.  
Take pieces you like and transcribe them.  Then try to write something similar.  Do speed writing, see how fast you can create a two minute song.
This is the industry side, stuff I'm personally not interested in but aware of how it works.  Production and speed being the skillset to develop. Some styles you can just patch electronic sounds together with little knowledge of music theory.

Now, If you are talking the craft and art of concert composing then I would suggest hiring a teacher.  It will save you lots of time trying to piece it all together from a variety of sources.
You need to know how to write four part <b><u>harmony</u></b>, cadence's, reharmonization, orchestration for sure... and that's just beginning.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The good news is you don't have to stay horrible at it....

1)I'd start off by taking something you already know the sound of, something you've heard since a kid; perhaps a nursery rhyme, hymn, pop tune, etc.  Sit down at your instrument and try to find that completely by ear.  Start on a different string and different fret with a different finger a few times, ie, different keys.  You say you can find stuff on the fingerboard but it's something to always work at.  This speeds up the hand to ear coordination of hearing something and knowing where it's at.

2)Practice singing melodies back that you hear, make a habit of it.  One thing I find is people take a recording and play a game of fast-forward/rewind, over and over, to the point they aren't even listening any more.  It's a game of hunt and miss.  

Don't do that.  Play the music, a short segment and then hum or sing it a few times until you can do it without the music.  Try to find it on your instrument only after you can at least hum it.  My opinion is to start with songs that have words.  Practice transcribing singers.  If you can't transcribe some guy singing quarter notes then fancy guitar riff is just going to be more difficult.  As has been alluded to by Reverb, as you get more advanced SOME of figuring out riffs by ear is just knowing lots of vocabulary.

3)<b><u>Harmony</u></b> wise-start with three chord songs.  I made a list for all of my students songs that were only 3 chords songs, stuff to supplement their studies by figuring out by ear.  Quite a few were lame country songs but the point was limiting it to only three chords and they had to be easy to hear.  The only way you get better at this is what I call error-correcting.  You play along, you make errors, you correct until the errors start to decrease.  Unfortunately some people can't handle all of the errors and give up.  When I started I couldn't even heard a I-IV-V and now let's just say I don't have any issues hearing difficult harmonies.  Lots of hours spent playing along to recordings.  

4)I realize it's not for everyone but sight-singing helped my ears.  Solfege is what helped me be able to transcribe something without an instrument.  I think singing is great, even if your voice sucks and you aren't trying to be a vocalist.  Sing basslines, sing arpeggios, etc.  All of these bring clarity to your inner hearing.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>You are assuming that we are good, haha.

There are so many layers to being a composer.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b>/Music Theory/Improvisation are things I worked at for years.  Improvisation for instance I worked at 5+ hrs a day for extended periods of time, this in the fields of jazz and folk music.  Lived and breathed it every day.  Performed and studied privately.  

Orchestration and what I would call "Concert" composing is newer to me.

Composing I actually have a teacher, despite all of my music knowledge it became apparent to me that the only way I was going to get better was to get feedback from another composer.  

I feel like we sometimes live in a world where people are afraid to ask for help, get a teacher, etc....thinking they are going to wing it or just watch a few youtube videos and suddenly become a better composer.  My advice is if you are truly serious about getting good then do exactly what the people whose music you admire did to get good.  Read interviews, replicate study processes, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I will give you a few ways to study/analyze music.

A lot of theory talk is about the very small details or can be overly focused on <b><u>harmony</u></b>/chords.  

What I currently do is go through a piece with a color pencil and find the structure of the song.  What are the sections, what are the motifs/themes?

How many measures are each section? Are there variations on the primary melody?  How did they move from one section to another?  I have my own ways of marking this all out but it involves an outline.

I of course do a harmonic analysis but I think in order to properly understand the harmonies you need to know why they were use and how they create structure.  For example, a modulation is a great tool to outline form for your audience.  So just because there is a V of V in there, that doesn't tell you much by itself.  

If composing and improvising are your goals then I would also find melodies in the songs you pick and transpose them to a couple of keys.  You basically want to get to the point that you know the keys inside and out so you aren't sitting there struggling to play something because you don't know that key.  The more you can take a melodic or harmonic idea and play it in a number of keys the more freedom you will have with your writing/instrument.  Speeds up the process.

This is something all jazz players work on but it shouldn't be limited to jazz or jazz vocabulary.  For example, I took a bunch of "licks" out of Ravel's string quartet and transposed them to a bunch of chords and keys.  

You like russian composers, go take some Tchaikovsky/Rimsky-Korsakov melodies and transpose them.  Something else you could do is even write variations on those melodies.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Ha, I can relate to some of this.  I feel like a very slow composer.

I'll give you random thoughts:

A typical answer is to compose more.  Compose every day.  At the same time, I'm not so sure how helpful that is once you get past a certain point with your music knowledge.  In particular if you are doing the same things wrong over and over again.  I know all the <b><u>harmony</u></b>/progressions/tons of repertoire,etc.  I often find this "compose everyday" can quickly turn into 20 unfinished pieces really quick.  

There seems to be part of music that no matter what you do, you are stuck with, ha.  Look at Ravel, he wasn't a fast composer.  He wasn't the only one, some people suffered each note.  Beethoven had to work harder than Mozart.  Look at Schubert, throwing out tunes like they were nothing.      

Here are some things my own teacher has shared with me or things I find help:

1)Make a blueprint/plan.  If you don't know where you are headed then it's hard to get there.  This could be form, keys/modulations, number of measures.  Write a bare minimal sketch (melody and bass only)

2)Work from Right to Left.  Perhaps you are starting at the beginning running out of steam and then can't figure out what to do.  Music is largely about energy, building and releasing it.  If you know where your high point it is, construct it and work backwards.  This often helps get me out of a bind.  Example, if I know I'm going to modulate to Eb for the bridge, then I can put a Bb7 in the previous measure, then a Fmin in the one prior to that and so on.  

3)Use a model.  Easy example, if I told you to write a song with the exact same chord changes and measures as Duke Ellington's "Take the A Train," it will be a lot easier than having infinite possibilities and limitations.  Don't be afraid to imitate and borrow like crazy.  Once again, lots of famous composers would sit and compose with a copy of someone elses work on their music stand as a "model."

4)JUST WRITE.  Forget what it sounds like, forget everything, take the piano/instrument and bash out something trying to get your mind out of the way as much as possible.  Recording improvisations can sometimes help.

5)I forgot which composer it was but when asked if he was going to fix something, he responded with, "I'll catch it on the next one."  In other words, give yourself to write something that might not be the best in the world and know that the next one will be better.  It's a growing process.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Look, this is seriously open ended.

It takes hours every day to become a good composer.

You need to understand form/structure/<b><u>harmony</u></b>/constructing melodies/possible orchestrating.

These days you probably want to know something about sound production, MIDI and recording software (necessary evil).
</p></li></ol></div><hr><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">User: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/michinoku>michinoku</a><ol><li><p><b>Accordion</b><br>If you mean Jazz soloing, the safe ground comes from the amount of preparation you do in learning scales and chords and licks or patterns in those scales or chords. It takes years.

Probably the easiest shortcut into it is to make sure you learn a bunch of pentatonic scales - there are various, but many include the essential notes of most standard chord variations, and omit what are called 'avoid notes' in jazz, places where to have a sharp or flat variant would create too strong a dissonance compared to the key or terminology.

I am definitely not an expert at 'inside' jazz soloing, though I do a lot of free improvisation, but in my efforts to explore it further, it helped a lot to get a better understanding of jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b>, like common chord progressions (ii-V-I most especially) and chord extensions, which open up more harmonic possibilities in terms of how notes can relate to the root/chord.
</p></li><li><p><b>VGCovers</b><br>I think it's worth keeping in mind also that a lot of video game music directly breaks the rules of music theory, and so you sometimes need to decide between an authentic cover and a "correct" cover in theory terms. Obviously as /u/joshuataipale says, the rules are broken quite frequently and with great success - otherwise, how would any classical music from late-period Liszt on be successful?

as for your track posted - it's not the rhythm (triplets vs straight rhythm) but the fact that two lines have notes happening at the same time that sound as though they're a minor second apart - which, at least in tonal music, is something of a no-no (obviously this was broken in the renaissance and it has been broken in the last 150 years of classical music, but general rules, right?). The problem mgiht be fixed by changing the register, or by somehow changing the timbre of one line or another (some filter or something) so it's clear that there's two distinct lines going on.

but yeah - sounds like the best way to go would be looking at chords/<b><u>harmony</u></b>. I found a series of books awhile ago online by the composer Alan Belkin which do a great job of explaining some of these principals - (also one on orchestration, counterpoint and form) see [here](http://www.alanbelkinmusic.com/bk.H/index.html) for that link.
</p></li><li><p><b>VGCovers</b><br>Nice sound - with the two voice <b><u>harmony</u></b> it almost sounds like a ska line.
</p></li><li><p><b>Accordion</b><br>There are a few good resources out there: the Gary Dahl Chord Melody Method book for accordion (which focuses more on the right hand but is a decent resource for thinking about <b><u>Harmony</u></b>), or the Ralph Stricker Jazz Theory and Improvisation Studies for Accordion book. Both of these are useful because they deal specifically with how to interpret things on the accordion, which takes some getting used to if you're, say, reading off of a lead-sheet as opposed to a full grand-staff score. I also like The Mighty Accordion, which while not strictly about jazz helps you make your way around the Stradella bass machine, which is a big obstacle in being able to play extended chords comfortably.

But there are a ton of free resources out there, on the wider Web as well as on YouTube, that deal with the idea of Jazz <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, which is the deepest well IMO in terms of playing in a style that sounds and feels recognizably jazzy. Understanding a bit more of that stuff will also help get you to the point where you can comfortably play from a lead sheet without needing to really prep beforehand. If you have a good sense of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, phrasing and soloing comes more naturally. And of course, listen to as much jazz as you can, both by accordionists and not, to get steeped in how the music works. Theoretical knowledge will only take you so far!

But anyway, tell us about yourself a bit - do you already play accordion? what's your comfort level with the instrument? with music theory in general? do you read sheet music reasonably well? do you learn by ear well? all these things help.
</p></li><li><p><b>Accordion</b><br>Cool. You're probably in good hands with those books. The temptation may be to blow through those first few PH books because the tunes are, let's face it, kinda boring, but it's really important to make sure your coordination is good between LH and RH as you progress on the instrument. Practice scales, even though they feel impossible on a vertical keyboard, and impossible(x100) on the left hand side - all the standard pedagogy advice applies, like using a metronome, making sure you can play things slowly, etc.

But if you're playing in a jazz band, you get a little more freedom. I think the goal should be for players of a chordal instrument to be able to play competently as a solo performer, but that doesn't mean you should wait until then to start. Sit in or just watch the jazz band as much as possible, and by all means keep listening with open ears - maybe if you're listening to a song, find multiple versions of it, or latch on to one player's solo and try and see what about it that moves you - is it their note choices? how fast they play? how they phrase their improvisation? then compare that to the choices someone else makes in those same categories.

From the level you're at, I would suggest starting with the Gary Dahl book and working from there, as getting a good knowledge of right hand chords will be very valuable in getting to a level of being able to both comp and improvise consistently. Even if you can't get a copy, there are jazz piano resources that may be adapted - so that you can make sure you know that when you see "G7" or "Abm7(b5)" you know what the chord tones are. I mean, it's a whole world out there and there are a lot of ways you could take it.

Also just now occurred to me that the very good jazz player [Dallas Vietty](http://www.rebelreed.com)  is someone you might want to look into. I haven't subscribed to his site yet but he has an option where you can do a free subscription that gives you access to a bunch of exercises and resources that deal w/ jazz accordion. He's a very solid player, both in terms of jazz/<b><u>harmony</u></b> concepts and accordion technique. If you track down the YouTube Channell for Liberty Bellows accordion shop (in Philadelphia, PA), he recorded a bunch of instrument test videos for them which shows him playing unaccompanied.
</p></li><li><p><b>Accordion</b><br>Keep in mind it's not just about the range but about the character of the sound. An accordion bass machine may be able to hit the right range of notes to hold down a bass sound, but the thump of the bass strings does as much for the rhythm as it does for the range of notes.

Some music doesn't need that kind of thing, though, so I guess it's whether or not you're playing music with a steady beat, etc. It also depends on what kind of beats/patterns you're doing with your left hand, and if they are steady or syncopated, etc. If you do a lot of patterns where the bass note is more infrequent or irregular, then it will be harder to be heard next to a drum kit.

Accordion is also a good bridge between rhythm section and melody/<b><u>harmony</u></b>, so it can be really nice to play with a bass player to have that flexibility.

But ultimately, the best way to tell is to try it, and take a recording of it, either from a practice session or a gig, and just see how it sounds through a sound system. Accordion left hand sounds way louder to the player than it does to almost anyone else, and if you're it for the low end, you want to make sure you can be heard anchoring everything.

</p></li><li><p><b>Accordion</b><br>There's always the old joke - 
"Q:how do you keep two accordionists in time? A: Shoot one of them"
but as with any instrument that CAN do rhythm among other things, an effective duet is just a matter of finding the right roles for each player, be it the right <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or a counter-melody in the left hand, etc. But if  both doing oom-pah (or oom-pah-pah) rhythms and primary melodic lines, you'd start to see quickly why the above joke came about (besides general meanness to accordions...)

As for extant duets I know of few (I see a handful of free-scores.com but can't vouch for them), but there is a whole body of accordion orchestra music from the 50s and before that could give you some idea of how to make the best use of multiple accordions.

Now, of course, if you meant duet as accordion with another instrument, this is extremely common. I've done a fair amount of playing with accordion/guitar, accordion/violin, accordion/clarinet or flute, and it works really nicely because then you can usually fake an arrangement off of a decent lead-sheet...
</p></li><li><p><b>Accordion</b><br>Not much to add here but his accordion is beautiful - I wish that lighting effect wasn't on the video (apparently on all his videos?) so we could have a better look at it...

I don't know Irish music super well, but it does seem like's subverting a little of the expectation by going to the relative minor (B minor, from the home key of D) in some of the sections. It's a sensible choice for someone playing a <b><u>harmony</u></b> instrument in music that may have been originally conceived as a vocal song or as a solo fiddle tune - otherwise, we chordal instruments are stuck playing drones, which can get old after awhile. I notice this trick gets used a lot in Scandinavian music when it is played by chordal instruments like guitars and accordions. Similarly, he's got a nice descending bass line in what I think is the second section, walking down from the G to the D before pivoting to the A-major.
edit: clarity
</p></li><li><p><b>Accordion</b><br>I could give it a shot - but my accordion is in the shop for a few days. The potential issue with playing it on a Standard/Stradella bass accordion is that the trademark left-hand part in Vince Guaraldi's version, which is part of what makes the tune so recognizable, would be a little reduced because it depends on having a full octave range. You'd definitely be able to get the core of the melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> - just the bass ostinato would be somewhat less familiar. 

If you can ask whether or not the musician plays a free-bass vs standard bass accordion, that would help - a free-bass accordion would be able to do it pretty easily, I'd think.

Congratulations, btw.

I read the term "linear counterpoint" on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint#Linear_counterpoint) in relation to Stravinsky and that has always made sense to me in describing the combination of his strong part writing and <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Here are some topics to look up that may help :)

Look up “functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>”. This will help with basic chord progression, as it breaks diatonic chords into categories (tonic, dominant, sub dominant) and explains why each category “leads” to another I.e. what should sound good.

Cadences deal with “returning home”.

Modulation is about changing keys to create interest.

Chord substitution deals with making things more interesting. This handles throwing in other, often non-diatonic chords and explains why they still work. Jazz uses this a lot. 

Altered chords also add interest. 

A blues ignores standard diatonic limitations, instead working with the harmonic relationships established in basic functional theory (the relationship of a I chord, IV chord, and V chord) where the root changes normally but the chords stick to dominant 7 chords.

A fugue (often) uses literal transposition of a single melody to create harmonic interest, often modulation.

Counterpoint deals with the specific intervals between each note sounding at the same time, in order to make sure none of them clash. It breaks each interval into two categories: consonant and dissonant, and prescribes rules for how much dissonance is allowed in each bar. However, knowing which intervals are consonant and dissonant is generally helpful and provides a way of focusing not just on chords, but strong harmonic relationships within them.

“Voice leading” is very important if you want to go deeper than “this chord moves to this chord”. It focuses on each note in a chord and how it moves to the next note. Strong voice leading means strong chord choices.

Wikipedia is great for most of these topics. I find these principles are great, as they are tried and true ideas that get me thinking beyond things I’ve heard or done before and I end up trying new things instead.

Hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Reading and working through the exercises in Gradus Ad Parnassum changed how I think about composition and <b><u>harmony</u></b> in the best way.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Maybe take a look at functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> or voice leading.

Functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> deals with which chords sound good in sequence, and then you might look into chord substitution and borrowed chords.

With good voice leading you can move each note in a chord independently and if the movement is strong you can end up with some interesting chord choices.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Well. This is a big post, and I don't think I can answer all of your questions, but I will offer what I can. I'll break down the major topics and a quick summary of each in an order that I think makes sense.   


**Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>**: The logic behind chord progression is often built around the chord function of triads or seventh chords (and possibly their extensions, though function can begin to become blurry the more complex the chord becomes). The principle behind many charts you might find is that Tonic (I / first) chord is "home" (in Classical <b><u>harmony</u></b> the goal is essentially to return to this "home"). The Dominant (V / fifth) chord has a strong relationship to the tonic, and "leads" home to it (giving an "authentic" cadence, essentially a strong way of ending a musical thought). And Subdominant (IV / fourth) chord "prepares" the Dominant, leading away from the Tonic to the Dominant (though it can lead to the Tonic for a weak cadence). This forms the basis of progression in much of western music, and is sort of the primary underlying logic.  


**Non-Chord Tones**: It is important to understand which notes belong in the chord currently being played (called *chord tones*) in order to build melodies that sound consonant. However, you don't necessarily *have* to only play chord tones in a melody. Melodies would be boring arpeggiations if they only used notes from the chord. However, if you only played notes that don't belong in the chord, it might sound like you're hitting wrong notes and like you don't know which chord you're meant to be playing. Classical and Baroque music have stylistic rules for resolving non-chord tones (which are considered dissonant), which tell you how to use them over a chord (look up neighbor notes, passing tones, appogiatura, suspension, escape tones). The idea, generally, is to make sure you're melody has more chord tones than non-chord tones, unless you're going for a different style. In Classical music, chords that aren't part of the triad or seventh chord are simply considered non-chord tones, so there's no need to justify them as extensions.  


**Chord Substitution**: From there, you can begin to substitute chords with similar "functions". This is useful, because only every using I, IV, and V chords in a progression would be boring. Using other chords from the scale is an effective way to start. In Classical style, chords that share the Tonic function are the iii and vi; the viiø chord shares the Dominant function; and the ii shares the Subdominant. This helps with making chord progressions a lot more interesting and makes use of the whole major scale (and the same principles can be applied to the harmonic minor scale, which is the natural minor altered to have a dominant V7 chord by raising the 7th scale degree).  


To add further interest, you can start borrowing chords that do not usually appear in the scale you're working with. This is actually a bit easier than it sounds. Probably the two primary techniques are Dominant Substitution and Modal Interchange. 

\-**Dominant Substitution** is where you use a dominant chord to create a pull to any other chord from the scale. You do this by creating a Dominant V chord a perfect fifth above the chord you want to pull to. So for the ii chord, you would create a V/ii chord (read: five of two): for example, if you have a Cm chord, you count a perfect fifth above to G and build a G7 chord. 

\-**Modal Interchange** is where you borrow a chord from another scale or mode built on the same root pitch. If I am in C Major playing a C major chord, maybe I will decide to borrow the C minor chord from the C minor scale. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Voice leading**: This is probably the other principle that forms logic for chord progressions. This has to do with the position of notes from a chord and how they move to the position of notes in the next chord. Each note in a chord is classified as a "voice" (based on when music was written primarily for vocalists). Generally, you want each note in a chord to move smoothly to the next note of the next chord; that is, you usually don't want big jumps and the closer the movement, usually the better.   
\-*Counterpoint*: This technique takes a close look at the intervals between notes and has rules designating motion (contrary motion, oblique motion, parallel motion, similar motion). In common practice (Baroque/Classical/Romantic <b><u>harmony</u></b>) you don't want "parallel" movement of fifths or octaves, though in modernism this can become exactly what you want (e.g. Debussy).  
\-*Inversion*: Not all chords are in root position, where the root pitch of the chord is on the bottom. This helps add interest (you could use only I chords and change the inversion to make it sound like you're moving along a bit, even though you're really still home). Further, this allows for much smoother voice leading.   


**Linear <b><u>Harmony</u></b>**: this is where chord logic is not really determined by function, but by motion. Voice leading takes full control here. Chord progression logic in linear <b><u>harmony</u></b> comes down to voice leading, in that the next chord is created by moving each voice (or at least some of the voices) to a tone near it (the movement can be more convincing and/or less jarring if you move fewer voices at a time, though this may or may not be the effect you want!). You can make this as consonant or dissonant as you decide, and it is an interesting way to come up with very unique progressions that otherwise might not make "sense" that are justified by strong voice leading. It is probably beneficial to think about tension and release when choosing chords this way.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 1: I think you are correct. Seventh chords are the foundation of jazz theory and even used functionally in many circumstances in the common practice period, so sevenths can fairly be considered chord tones. In Baroque/Classical practice, anything extended beyond a seventh is a non-chord tone, but in modern &amp; jazz (and even Romantic) <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you might even treat extensions as chord tones. In jazz you often leave other chord tones out, prioritizing the 3rd and 7th chord tones (imply the root and 5th). You might want to read [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_chord) on extended chords for how they are used in Romantic or jazz music, as I am more experienced in Classical and Modern <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Modern <b><u>harmony</u></b> uses added tone chords, which don't have to resolve, which is fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 2: You can obviously use any chord progression you want. If you want to further "justify" the chord progressions, you can root your progressions in the principles of function and substitution, or strong voice leading. Though, doing what sounds right to you is probably justification enough if you are confident it is the sound you want.

&amp;#x200B;

Forgive me if I missed anything or if you already know any/all of that. Hope that's helpful! Happy to have further discussion on this, and if anyone has anything to contribute or correct here then please let me know in a reply to this comment!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I like the first motive you present. It’s a very simple motive, but the <b><u>harmony</u></b> underneath is interesting and explores the motive really nicely. The arpeggios in the middle section remind me of Philip Glass. Nice progressions.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I’m not following what the books are trying to explain. I will try to help, though.

I don’t think it hurts to start in root position (1-3-5-7). It’s a really strong, stable voicing. From there, it’s good to voice chords so that each voice moves to the nearest note in the next chord, or sticks to a common tone (e.g. if E can move to either D or B, move to D). This principle will get you inverting chords from necessity. Inversions help create interest.

You can always experiment by starting with other inversions to see what options that opens up — this will give you different sounds to choose from for the same chords. But as a starting principle, strong voice leading is often a good idea. Though, if you need to break from the principle to create an interesting effect, or if you want to jump to another register, you can play with those ideas. Parallel movement (same voicing but moved somewhere else) can be cool, too.

In jazz the 3 and 7 of each chord are usually considered the most important tones. Bass often covers the root. This frees up room for interesting extensions.

You can also play with quartal and quintal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, where instead of building chords by 3rds, you build chords in 4ths (e.g. C F B) or 5ths (C G D). 

Hope that helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>For more Stravinsky check out Concerto in D, Symphony in C, and Petrushka if you haven’t. The rhythm in these works is amazing, on top of the fascinating <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Many layers to his work that keep me finding new bits of gold all the time, and these are great examples of that.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>For <b><u>harmony</u></b>, there’s a good Coursera course called Write Like Mozart. Definitely focused on the classical-era style, but very helpful knowledge to have for any style.

For form, [this](http://alanbelkinmusic.com/bk/F.pdf) ebook by Alan Belkin is awesome. He also has a great YouTube course on modern <b><u>harmony</u></b>. And many of his other resources are great.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>There have been a lot of Stravinsky recommendations already, but I’ll add some more.

On the less dissonant side, Dumbarton Oaks is one of my favourites, as well as Danses Concertantes. These have a lot of the big <b><u>harmony</u></b> and unusual/engaging rhythm I feel represent his style. Symphony in C for something bigger in a similar rhythmic/harmonic style. 

To get more dissonant, try Concerto in D (and Petrushka has its heavily dissonant moments). 

This might be a good lead up to Rite in terms of getting into his rhythmic style and getting progressively more intense/dissonant.

Also if you dig the first few I mentioned, try Francis Poulenc’s Biches Suite, Animeaux Modeles, or Sinfonietta.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I agree. I think linear <b><u>harmony</u></b>, polyphony, and alternative forms of counterpoint can give way to unique emergent harmonies that you don’t get from functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, possibly in a way that hasn’t been fully explored.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It might be a little early to suggest this, but once you get a handle on melody, chords, and functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> then it sounds like you will love baroque and classical counterpoint. Both are sets of rules derived from aesthetic goals that, when followed correctly, essentially create the styles of those eras of music.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>To fit the style of baroque or classical music, yes. Absolutely. The focus on triadic <b><u>harmony</u></b> and rules for doubling were important for those styles. 

But if you break the rules a bit, or modify the rules according to different aesthetic preferences, you can get some interesting results. It’ll likely sound more modern (and sometimes more pre-baroque, IMO) and can be heavy on dissonance (or not). 

For instance, if you stick pretty closely to your key signature, but don’t worry about the voices forming triads, you can wind up with lots of extended chords, or sevenths, or clusters. The emergent chords/harmonies are not a result of planning the progression, but arise from a focus on strong part-writing and voice leading. Often, strong voice leading and strong part writing is enough to give cohesion. 

This has been my experience anyway :)

If you are diligent enough to work your way through it (and work on your own ear training) you can learn a LOT about theory. Best of luck! 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>It really depends on what you want to write but I'll list some materials and you can decide their relevance to your work.

*Counterpoint* by Kent Kennan is an excellent resource to learn counterpoint. This is very much Bach-style counterpoint but of course the overall principles are important to know regardless of your preferred style of music. You can get this book for free with a free trial of Scribd (that's how my whole class got the book).

&amp;#x200B;

*The Fundamentals of Musical Composition* by Arnold Schoenberg is a book that sort of tackles the process of (common practice era) composition and forms. It uses many examples from the common practice era but they are, of course, very much still relevant and useful regardless of aesthetic or style. This book is available for free as a [pdf](https://monoskop.org/images/d/da/Schoenberg_Arnold_Fundamentals_of_Musical_Composition_no_OCR.pdf).

&amp;#x200B;

*Instrumentation and Orchestration* is great for learning about idiomatically writing for each instrument, orchestration techniques and notational practices. It is also a EXCELLENT reference book. For each instrument it lists ranges of beginner players, high-schoolers, and professionals as well as the dynamic curve to illustrate how loud the instruments can be in different parts of the range. It also contains plenty of cheat sheets like fingering charts for woodwinds, the fingerboards of string instruments, chord charts for guitar, etc. It's really an invaluable book. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Analyzing Classical Form* by William Caplin may be a bit too much to tackle for now as he tends to have a lot of specific definitions for things that differ from other theorists and he tends to give too many details at once. It is, however, a top-notch book for really understanding how forms work on both the small scale and the large. It is best in used in a class setting though.

&amp;#x200B;

*20th Century <b><u>Harmony</u></b>* by Vincent Persichetti is great for exactly what it sounds like. I won't talk too much about it but it's an excellent read and resource and I highly recommend it. It is also available on Scribd with a free trial. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, composer Alan Belkin has a truly spectacular [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUQ0TcIbY_VEk_KC406pRpg/playlists) and website full of excellent free resources to teach you about most of the topics I've listed (and more) and their practical use. Highly, *highly* recommend.

3. It's completely fair to judge it based off of a traditional standpoint or "What would Bach do" as it is 100% inspired by bach and his preludes.

4. I genuinely loved every idea you gave in terms of how to improve it. I have been studying theory on my own for a few months, and <b><u>harmony</u></b> has always been scary to me. I'll be taking AP music theory this coming year, so hopefully that will help. I'll definitely check out the resources you recommended though  

Although I don't plan on changing this piece, EVERYTHING you said is going into consideration  for the next one I right. Again, THANK YOU

</p></li><li><p><b>ClassicalMemes</b><br>The <b><u>harmony</u></b> in bach's c major prelude is pretty interesting. I don't have it on me rn but I did an analysis a few months ago and there's a F#dim7 going to a C major in 2nd inversion near the end that sounds pretty rad 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I just listened to the entire piece, and I don't know how best to describe my experience other than I feel like I didn't listen to anything. There are fragments of ideas spewn throughout that seemingly have nothing to do with each other. I was initially going to comment on how the <b><u>harmony</u></b> seemed very stale, but eventually I became puzzled by your transition from one chord to the next, and I think you should look into better [voice leading](https://youtu.be/UcpTWmtEyPo). The melody felt non existent, and I would have forgotten it completely had it not been featured so many times throughout the piece. I may be incorrectly assuming that you're going for a romantic sound when composin a nocturne, so I'd also recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/WlW9TiaUOZ0). 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I feel like you're so enticed by the THOUGHT of all of these musical ideas, that you didn't stop to care about how it sounds. Moving around the circle of fifths is a cool thing in music, but when proceeded by two minutes of boring <b><u>harmony</u></b> in one key, it sounds terribly out of place and completely random.

Using a polyrythm is exciting, and it can be a great show of musical ability. But when it's an extended section of polyrythms that clash against each other where each line seems to have nothing to do with other, then it won't sound good.

And where did you gather that "using triplets" being a notable part of chopin? When I think of chopin, I imagine bel canto melodies with a beautiful accompaniment, and a perfect balance of drama to the very last measure. Not triplets 

Don't be too excited by the alure of more uncommon/ advanced musical techniques. They are awesome when used correctly, and sound bad when not. And the listener doesn't hear the advanced rhythms or complex changes, they just hear music. And if the music doesn't sound pleasing, then they won't like it 

</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>I like it as a first composition. Certainly better than mine. I feel like there's just not much going on. As far as <b><u>harmony</u></b> goes, this is about as un interesting as it gets. And I couldn't really latch on to any theme or melody. Who would you say inspired you the most in this composition?
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I listened to about 2 minutes of it, and I have some questions that I guess aren't all related to the piece 
1. I didn't check to see if each row was the same or whatever, but are those repeated note triplets part of 12 tone rules? Wouldn't that make those repeated notes more important than other notes?
2. What makes it a fugue and not just a repetition of the original row? There seems to be no concern for part writing (parallel intervals, arriving at intervals by similar motion) and obviously there's no rules to follow as far as <b><u>harmony</u></b> goes 
3. What rules specifically were you working around when composing this?
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Learning a little bit of theory is gonna be much better than having an AI choose your <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I suggest checking out musictheory.net 

If you want, you can pm me your melody and I'll work out some <b><u>harmony</u></b> and explain my decisions 
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>I think this is your best piece. I found the <b><u>harmony</u></b> interesting to listen to. My only complaints are stylistic: It's pretty repetitive, and doesn't feel like it's going anywhere. The melody doesn't lead anywhere, but maybe that's intentional 
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>You probably already know this, but the left hand is very repetitive, alternating between two harmonies that don't seem to have any motion. This limits what you can do in the melody, since there isn't any opportunity for tension and release, which makes the piece feel like it isn't going anywhere, just staying in one place 

The thing is, that could be entirely what you intended. There are a whole lot of pieces that use boring repetitive <b><u>harmony</u></b> that are very popular, and it would make sense for that to be your inspiration. In that case it's a fine piece, but still particularly uninteresting.

Remember though, this is your VERY FIRST composition. I remember when I wrote my first piece, it got absolutely torn to shreds. I took people's criticisms, and over time developed a somewhat more unique style. No one has a great first piece, and I'm excited for a year from now when you'll begin to really shine. I'll be keeping an eye on you
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I'm probably not saying anything you don't already know, but it's not particularly interesting (at least in my opinion). Its fairly repetitive and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> leaves much to be desired, and the melody isn't really remarkable, which are ALL things that I'm guilty of so don't feel too bad about that.

The thing is, I'm almost certain that you already know all of this. It's a poppy arpeggiated chord progession played under a simple diatonic melody. There's a billion other songs just like this that tons of people love by composers such as yiruma and einaudi. So I guess my criticisms aren't really at you, but at the genre you compose for. It's not high art, but if you enjoy composing and playing music like this, all power to you man. Like I said, composers such as yiruma and einaudi are adored by so many people
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I see how this could be useful for jazz harmonization, but Bach pretty much harmonized them entirely with the harmonic language of his time. Jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b> could be interesting tho  🤔
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Pretty nice. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> becomes really getting after a while, because it's pretty much the same chords for 2 minutes, and the moments of harsh dissonance in the melody feel really out of place in such a consonant piece
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>Pleasantly suprised by the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Maybe the folks at r/composer would have more to say, but beware that you need to provide a score
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The chords on top are correct. That's the <b><u>harmony</u></b> that's playing, but the only sheet music that is shown is the melody. So we only see the the melody, but we can hear the melody and the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, which is labeled
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Gorgeous music. I'm a sucker for parallel 5ths and this kind of <b><u>harmony</u></b> in general. Really a beautiful piece of music. The only change I would make would be to add slurs or some way to show phrasing. The rubato made things a little harder to follow, and sometimes it felt like it could have been in 4/4 with how much the beat was being pushed and pulled. Not really a knock on the piece though, still beautiful music and <b><u>harmony</u></b>
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, yeah :p but I still would like to understand music beyond what I learned in theory class. And I'd like to learn whatever I possibly can from these scores, even more than <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I just don't feel like I have the capacity to do so yet.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Ooh boy, what lovely music. I'm gonna refer to them in movements, so keep that in mind.

For the first movement, the intro felt a little stilted, but after that I thought it was pretty great. I loved the rapid, manic intensity throughout.

The 2nd movement was definitely the weakest. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> was a lot more stale, but it's not like it has to be complex to be good, so that's fine. The repeated note would probably sound much better on a real piano, so I'll give that a pass too. My main issue is with the melody: there's absolutely no syncopation, and in a piece where the melody is right there in that spotlight, it got very uninteresting. It felt like it was tied down to the "grid" of the piece, instead of being a free melody. I'd try to imagine an opera singer singing the melody, and how much freer that would be 

The 3rd movement was just a lot of fun to listen to, as I imagine it was to write. Like something out of looney tunes. No criticisms here, just great fun music.

As a whole, I have two issues. First, I feel like the music didn't necessitate being for two pianos. If the melody weren't doubled in octaves and the chords were less wide, it would sound very similar on one piano. But I guess melody doubling could itself be a reason to use two pianos 

Secondly, the musescore playback does this thing no justice. It really is good music, and I hope one day you can find someone to play this (not me, nowhere near good enough). Great work man
</p></li></ol></div><hr><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">User: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/IsThatGaryTheFish>IsThatGaryTheFish</a><ol><li><p><b>composer</b><br>This is definitely I think one of the hardest aspects of composition, something that takes looots of practice.  I don't think it has entirely to do with your melodies being different from one another, contrast is great and is possible to work naturally.  

In my experience, transitioning between melodies can seem more natural by keeping SOME sort of common ground.  It can be rhythmical, it can include a similar ostinato variant, a new twist on a harmonic figure, in a key which is related to the last, there are so many different aspects to a section of music you often don't even realize all of them yourself - even as the composer.

For a more natural transition, use a bridge.  These can be difficult to write, but the right bridge can naturally transition almost any two melodies and/or sections.  There are many different ways to go about writing a bridge, but a standard framework for a bridge usually starts at the highest point of tension in your melody A - this is usually towards the end of the phrase.  So basically, instead of completing your phrase as per usual, you extend what you perceive as the point of tension/the climax.  Commonly this is done by repeating a motif found at this point, and then putting it through some sort of variation to produce some sort of sequence.  

Where this sequence goes is up to you and your ear - but during this journey, know where you're headed!! This is the most important thing - rarely is it wise to write bridges before you have already written the first phrase of the new melody B, complete with <b><u>harmony</u></b> and everything.  While you're in your journey of the bridge, start to introduce elements of your upcoming melody.  This prepares the listener.  There are many different things you can begin to introduce - chord progression, harmonic rhythm, melodic rhythm, melodic and intervalic motifs - these are just a few of many.  

You're end product of your bridge is something that grows out of melody A and that introduces elements of melody B, so that when your sequence completes and arrives at melody B, it's both satisfying, new, interesting, yet not totally out of the blue.

Of course there are many other alternatives to using a sequence-structured bridge, but in my experience there are three things of imporance:

1) Have it "grow" out of melody A
2) Introduce elements of melody B beforehand
3) Keep SOME sort of similarity between A and B.  This does not have to be melodic.  A rhythmic motif, a harmonic motif, etc. etc. You don't have to use them exactly like they were either - variation is your friend.  Retrograde, invert, put things in double time, etc etc. 

These are some of the thoughts and processes I go through personally, but it's still tricky.  Practice, listen and analyse some of your favourite works.  Find a transition that just seems so natural to your ear and then figure out what the composer did - more often than not there is theory behind it all.   
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Harmonically and melodically, modes are actually very complex.  I'm not sure that playing Phrygian over C-maj would really make any music at all.  Modes are (generally speaking) ALTERNATIVES to the major-minor scale.  Each mode has melodic and harmonic characteristics that are inherently different than the major-minor system.

But one thing at a time - your C Phrygian scale is correct - another way to think of it is as a C minor scale with a flat second degree.  

Usually however, when you want to have something sound Phrygian, you use the mode for both the <b><u>harmony</u></b> AND the melody.  For example, you'd use your C Phyrgian scale over a C minor chord (the tonic chord of C Phyrgian).  

Your idea in 4 is correct.  A section, melody, bar, or whatever have you of Phrygian content will have Phrygian <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  Diatonic <b><u>harmony</u></b> is treated in Phrygian just like it is in Aeolian and Ionian.  

Your harmonic analysis is half-correct in 5 - C Phrygian has c-Ab-f-gdim.  When you're in Phrygian, every note is altered to its Phrygian state at all times.  Comparing it to Ionian (the major scale) is harder to grasp than comparing it to Aeolian (the minor scale).  The Phrygian mode only differs from the natural minor scale by one note - the flat second.  


All-in-all I'd suggest you think of the modes as variants of the major-minor scales.  Each is it's own standalone scale with it's own standalone diatonic harmonies and melodic characteristics.  The major modes (other than Ionian) are Lydian and Mixolydian (due to the major third), and the minor modes outside Aeolian are Dorian and Phrygian (due to the minor third).  Locrian counts as minor mode as well, but it's the outlier mode so to speak.  You use each as if they were your exact replacements for your minor-major scale (for the most part. Altering the 6th and 7th degrees of Dorian and Phrygian don't work like they do in the minor scale).  

And here's a fun tidbit - if you're wondering why the modes aren't used nearly as often as the major and minor scale, it's due to their instability.  Every non-Ionian/Aeolian mode has a tritone relation between some note in their tonic triad and another note within the mode.  In addition, the most important triads harmonically (IV, V, I) don't all match in function like they do in Ionian and Aeolian.  For example, the major scale has C MAJOR, F MAJOR, G MAJOR - notice how they're all in agreement? Same goes for the minor scale.  This is not the case with modes, giving them a unique flavour to be sure, but a good amount of uncertainty and instability which is harmonically difficult to stabilize for long periods of time. Difficult but not impossible ;) 

TL;DR - Modes are fabutastic 


</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>Across all cultures and times, it has been generally pleasurable to have music have a center - a tonic.  From ancient Muslim chanting, to Inuit throat singing, to the ragas of Indian Classical music, having a pitch to which all the other pitches relate to.  It's seemingly universal.

Our concepts of scale and <b><u>harmony</u></b> are primarily western only though. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's due to the technicalities and parallels between Ionian and Aeolian (major and minor scale).  These two scales/modes are the most inherently stable modes of all of them for a couple of reasons.  First of all, they are the only scales that have no tritone relationships between its tonic triad and the other diatonic triads.  If we were looking at the white-key modes for example (C Ionian, D Dorian, E phrygian, etc), the C major tonic triad and the A minor triad are the only two tonic triads that do not have an F or a B in them.  As we know, F and B make a tritone and as such and tonic triad in the white key modal system which includes an F or a B will have some outside tritone relationship with another diatonic triad within the mode.

The second feature which makes the major and minor scales more stable than the other modes is the agreement of the tonic triad with the subdominant and dominant triads.  The subdominant and dominant are the two most important cornerstones of western <b><u>harmony</u></b> - in the major/Ionian scale, the tonic triad is major, the subdominant is major, and dominant is major.  This agreement adds to the stability of the mode.  It's the same in Aeolian - the tonic is minor, the subdominant is minor, and the dominant is minor.  This is why the Ionian and Aeolian/major and minor scales are the most used in Western music
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm adding a little late to this discussion, but here goes;

First off - a modal scale will inherently sound more unstable and unresolved than a melody would be in that mode.  If you have an F lydian melody, it would sound a lot more resolved than just the scale, that is if it's written properly in F Lydian.  What I mean is emphasizing the right notes and ease off on the ones that would suggest a different key.  Lydian is actually kind of tricky to balance because it's third is it's relative Aeolian and it's dominant is it's relative Ionian.  But the idea is to write it as would any other melody, given the essential peaks and beats to the most important notes, which in the case of F lydian, will be a lot of F's to try and emphasize that's your tonic.  

Also, when pairing it with <b><u>harmony</u></b>, make use of inversions when using chords that could destabilize your mode.  Using the example of F Lydian, the main chord and note you'll be fighting against is C.  As such, you want to avoid C major chords in root position.  By using inversions, it helps eliminate a sense of arrival you might otherwise experience with the C major chord. Naturally it follows that you'll want to use root position bass lines and chords when you arrive at F major to help solidify that as the tonic.  Hope that helps!  
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Don't be too alarmed by what may seem to be "a lot of going on" in orchestral works.  Careful analysis of most orchestral pieces will show that each instrument can be defined as being either the melody, counter-melody, or accompaniment at that point in time.  Filling out a score vertically means there are more than one instrument in each roll.  Often they're just doubling one another in a different octave or even in unison.

When writing for tutti orchestra, it's never a good idea to have each instrument doing a different thing.  Orchestration deals with colours and the textures of mixing instruments.  Instead of putting the melody in the horn, put it in the brass section for example.  Horn also blends really well with the oboe and clarinet in quieter sections, and makes a fine double for the strings.  

Something wont take away from the main idea if you add more instruments to the main idea.

As for accompaniment, chords and <b><u>harmony</u></b> can be made into many other figurations than just a block chord.  For example you can hold the root in the cellos while the violins play an arpeggiation of the chord, with a flute trilling the 3rd and 4th on top.  There are countless possibilities.

I'd study some staple orchestral scores.  Nothing too modern, maybe something like a Beethoven or Haydn symphony, and just focus on the full vertical sections as you call them, and actually analyze what each instrument is doing.  You can get free scores as imslp.org.  Hope that helps! 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I'd start by saying to keep going and don't stop.

Before even listening to your music I'm already startled by the speed of which you are writing.  An album within your first few months of composing is staggeringly fast.  And it shows within your music, the majority of it is a lot of film and trailer music cliches without much sense of direction.  So my first piece of advice is to slow down and take your time when you write.  Really aim to get everything sounding the best it possibly can and be picky, otherwise it ends up sounding uninspired.

I'd really recommend to do some research into musical composition, it doesn't have to cost you anything.  If you haven't already, do some reading into <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and try checking out Alan Belkin at http://alanbelkinmusic.com/site/en/.  This guy's got a lot of free resources and practical tips for the beginner-intermediate composer.  

While it's basically impossible to do something "wrong" in composition, there are certainly many areas that could be better.  In your case I think it's creating a sense of direction.  Your pieces are very stagnant, keeping within one feeling, chord progression, and idea which never seems to go anywhere.  Every new instrument or line you bring in sounds more like a random addition than a calculated development which fits the music.  I'd recommend to try and think of music as a story - you've got some sort of introduction, which gives rise to a growing plot line and suspense, culminating at the climax, and easing off into the conclusion.  That's a very rough example, but what I'm trying to say is to give you music some sort of sense between beginning, middle and end.  I realize you're writing with the purpose of each small piece representing one emotion, so don't feel obligated to change the mood throughout.  There are countless other things you can change, like the harmonic progression, the dynamics, the instrumental textures, tempo, and so on.  

For a specific example of applying this to your own music, I'll use your track "Love". It's driven by an arpeggio-ostinato in the harp.  An easy way to create a sense of climax, interest, change and direction is to take this ostinato and put it into a more powerful instrument, like some low strings.  This would keep a sense of continuity, as it's the same recognizable line, but it would also keep things interesting by changing its instrumentation and thus its effect and feeling. Right now it feels like you can listen to the first 8-16 bars of your music and have already heard everything about the music.  Everyone starts at this point - composition is phenomenally hard to do well and all these things you could do better are things every beginning composer takes time to develop. 

Keeping things interesting I think is the most important and at the same time the hardest thing to work on.  Don't be afraid to experiment, you'll never know what might catch your ear - there is no specific formula for interesting music.  However there are some general tips;

Aim for contrasting sections.  Contrast is the most simple and effective way to generate interesting and a stronger emotional reaction to the music.  There are many many ways to contrast sections, it doesn't necessarily have to be through mood.  Contrast in tempo, in harmonic scheme, in dynamics, in texture, in melodic shape, in rhythmic subdivisions (sixteenths vs. half notes) - I can go on and on.  It's the difference between just adding things on and actually creating and drawing something new out of the music organically.  Sounds really complicated and it's hard to put into words but you'll get it soon enough.

I'd recommend showing your music to a few close friends or family members who would be supportive and offer their feedback and thoughts.  Even feedback from the least musical of people can be worth your while, its a new fresh perspective on your music and it really helps to see your music in a way not your own.

Anyways, the bottom line is keep going.  For your next piece, try to take your time, revise revise revise, and compose it over a period of a few weeks.  Aim for interesting developments and a sense of direction.  You've got the beginnings of an ear that hears what sounds good, the next step is to develop an ear which hears what comes next.  

Good luck!  
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Hey man,

I believe that this is an issue that many composers, especially early on in their career, fall victim to very easily.  I myself have felt the same "how am I going to write something actually GOOD again? I can't seem to write ANYTHING let alone something actually good" countless times.  Let's face it - inspiration that actually suits our standards of music making is rare during this part of our compositional lives.  So what can we do to work around this?

Something I like to do sometimes is to just take some time to listen to pieces of music I've written over the past couple years.  It reminds me of a couple things; that I've come such a long way, and that there is a lot of moments which DO meet my standards and I am really satisfied with.  Despite my periods of inspirational drought and self-doubts, I have always eventually came up with something I was happy with.  This cycle of anxiety to self-pride can often feel exaggerated, but it's always important to keep in mind that it is indeed a cycle and the other end will show itself soon enough.  Composition and creative inspiration doesn't just follow a day-by-day cycle like sunset and sunrise - to me it's more like entire seasons.  Just having the mindset that you WILL get your inspiration back is really important.

As for some more specific tips, it depends on the composer.  While composition requires inspiration, there are many things that do not.  At practically any time composition isn't flowing, you can sit down with a book on music theory instead.  Learn about jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b>, some scales used in Eastern culture - the possibilities are endless. I find this helps open your mind, and even better, keeps your spirits up since you still feel like you're doing something productive for your passion and that you're not just sitting there pulling your hair out.

There's long-standing advice to just to write a little something every day, no matter how bad it is.  Personally I do not find it satisfying nor helpful, but to some it most definitely is one of the best ways to keep at composing until you strike gold.

Finally, there's also a tip to make composing time the same time every day.  This helps prepare your brain for times of inspiration and creativity - it recognizes that during a particular time period during the day is devoted to creative thinking, and if you keep to the schedule enough, eventually it can become as natural as sleeping during night-time.  

Take long walks, listen to music you love and music you've never heard before, and stay positive! 

Good luck
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Oh the amazing realm of music psychology.  There are dozens of reasons as to why this song induces a feeling of somberness for you, and while many are inherently subjective, some of them are a little more tangible. I'll see if I can name some of them.

Other than pure subjectivity, I think one of the elements that can cause this to sound more somber than your average major dance song is the consistent presence of the the leading tone in both the bass line and the harmonic riff without being of a dominant function.  

In what is oft called "joyful" music, the leading tone (in this case B natural as this song is in C major) is generally only seen as part of the V chord or the vii diminished chord, limiting its strong 'yearning' feeling to strong cadences. When its included or suggestive of chords such as the iii or Imaj7, the yearning effect is now part of the tonic function, aka your home base.  So basically, the inclusion of the leading tone as initially laid out by the opening riff, particularly the E G B sequence (which outlines the iii chord), 'softens' the happiness that would otherwise be associated with your home base if the leading tone was only present during the V (G major) chord.  Easy rule of thumb to remember about major keys - the iii chord (in this case E minor - E G B) is one of the easiest ways to shift the mood from joy to something more bittersweet.  

I'd really have to sit down and listen to it carefully to work out all the harmonies, but from what I can gather, it doesn't have as many strong V-I relationships and instead uses 'weaker' subdominant, mediant, and whole-step relationships between chords. Basically, there aren't many strong cadences which drive the music forward in a clear-cut fashion, instead feeling more... smooth? Hard to describe exactly, but it's definitely a different feeling than the rigid sense of destination associated with the V-I movement particularly in the bass line.

In addition to <b><u>harmony</u></b>, there are many many other factors at play here; the timbre of her voice, the tempo, the emphasis of mid-range frequencies over bass frequencies, appoggiaturas held on the #4 of a chord during the chorus (holding a B natural over an F major chord before resolving downwards to the A) and more.

And this isn't even touching upon any personal and extra-musical connotations you may have with the song.  One of music's most moving qualities is its ability to induce nostalgia and subconsciously trigger old memories and feelings. 

Hopefully that's of some interest to you, but in the end these are only simple guesses at an extremely complex, personal and subjective emotional reaction.  Best of luck!  

  

 

 
</p></li><li><p><b>Learnmusic</b><br>Here are some tips and tricks I've come to appreciate with my time transcribing;

1. Work things out bit by bit. Focus your ear on one particular instrument/voice, one phrase at a time, or if that's not working, one bar at a time, or even one note at a time.  The more you pinpoint your focus the easier your ear will be able to identify what it's hearing.

2. On a similar note, work with what you DO have.  You say rhythm isn't an issue - so transcribe the rhythm! If you know the key, mark that down too, and so on.  Every piece of the framework that you're able to identify and lay out helps when listening for the complete product.

3. If possible, listen to the song at half speed.  Youtube allows this function for their videos and it can really help to work out those trickier passages.   

4. Finally, probably the most valuable tip of all is to have a good grasp of music theory.  With a substantial amount of theory to back up your ear, the process becomes immensely easier.  While someone without music theory knowledge will have to labour over trying to identify every pitch in every chord, someone with knowledge of chords and <b><u>harmony</u></b> can infer entire chords and progressions at a single listen due to knowing "what works". 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This - it's a harmonic sequence of 5ths and 2nds.  I-V, relation of a 5th, then up a second, vii-iii, same relation of a fifth, then up a second again, IV-I which once again is the same relation of a fifth. Then he breaks the sequence with a IV-V-I cadence which is extremely typical of baroque and classical <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Wowzers, that's quite the list.

I'd recommend looking into the work of John Sloboda and some of his followers - he deals with these sorts of concepts in a way that is up to date and as accurate as is possible with research of this kind.

I can give you some basic info however;

Tempo has far and away the most effect on perceived emotion.  "Sad" is nearly never described of a piece of fast tempo, yet you are sure to find examples of sadness which cover every other musical quality you listed.  Likewise, a "happy/joyous" song will almost NEVER be in a slow tempo. Tempo is more defining than <b><u>harmony</u></b>, scale, pitch, melody, timbre, rhythm, etc. 

Everything else you listed is extremely variable and much too difficult to give adamant answers for.  Qualities of music take their meaning when sounded with dozens of other qualities simultaneously, and each combination yields a different result. Not to mention - different listeners perceive things slightly differently, especially when you start switching cultures.  

Sloboda worked out a rough quadrant system however, from simple emotions and some musical qualities - Joy is most commonly *fast and simple* while on the opposite corner, sadness, is *slow and complex*.  More "angry" emotions generally fall under *fast and complex* and I forget the exact word he uses, but *slow and simple* is something like mellow contentment if I remember correctly.  In these examples, simple vs complex is a simplification of all the pairs of effects you've listed, and includes things like <b><u>harmony</u></b>, counterpoint, dissonance vs consonance, meter, rhythm, and so on.

Hope that helps - if you're interested, Sloboda's text which deals with this sort of thing (and also happens to be my resource for these assertions) is titled "Music and Emotion"
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>While I understand the thinking, I don't believe that's the case, and research suggests otherwise as well. By your reasoning, the faster a piece is, the more difficult it is to discern its emotion, and slowing it down would make the emotions more evident.  

That's just really not the case.  I came up with a few examples off the top of my head of some fast music which is very tellingly emotional;

https://youtu.be/-0nKJoZY64A?t=5m38s
https://youtu.be/t3217H8JppI?t=54m52s
https://youtu.be/c7O91GDWGPU?t=15s

Would slowing down Shostakovich's brutally terrifying and angry string quartet make it even more angry? Would slowing down the William Tell overture make its happy energy all the more evident? I'd argue, and many more people too, that in fact the tempo is an essential ingredient for those emotions to be conveyed in the first place.  The William Tell overture is especially interesting since even when it is quiet, it is abundantly obvious in its emotions.  

Tempo is linked to the core of so many musical emotions - like energetic music for example. Exhilarating. Pathetic. Or lethargic music.  You're not gonna put on a tape of fast music when trying to get your baby to sleep, and you're not gonna put on slow music when you're out head-banging at a party. 

It's worth mentioning volume too. Dynamics don't quite hold the same power, but are still important - they just vary in what they're conveying.  In western art music especially, changes in volume are absolutely vital and occur incredibly often. Adding a soft moment to a joyous piece remains a joyous piece, and a loud moment to a sad piece also remains sad.  However, I find that the basic emotion may alter slightly - like a melancholic sadness growing in volume to a grief-stricken sadness - but yes in general the basic underlying emotion does not change solely from volume.  My own personal opinion puts <b><u>harmony</u></b> as the second most important determinant of musical emotion but that's a tale for another time. 

Oh, and another shoutout to Sloboda - he's done several several studies which give evidence to claims like the ones I'm making

   

</p></li><li><p><b>Learnmusic</b><br>I've done a good deal of research into music and emotion, I'll try and sum up some of the scientific findings that have been developed over the past 20 or so years.

There are approximately 7 different ways that music invokes emotional responses in a listener, and many of these are subjective.  For example, there's episodic memory which happens when a piece of music becomes associated with a particular personal memory and thus a particular feeling.  Lyrics are also highly personal and subjective, and are most effective when they serve to remind the listener of something they themselves went through.  Then there are more broad but still subjective manners, like musical expectations (like expecting one chord but getting another).  These are largely similar across entire populations and not really "personal" but they're still culture-specific and do not inspire the same emotional responses in a remote Australian tribe for example.  

There ARE still some pretty universal and objective emotional responses to music, like brain stem response and rhythmic entrainment.  These sorts of emotional responses are basically "instinctual" for every human - things like responding with surprise or apprehension to a certain auditory event, and reacting to tempo.  Tempo is THE most important piece of the puzzle when considering a piece of music's emotional content.  Our bodies like to try and sync up our breathing, heartbeat, and more to the beat of the music.  Fast breathing and a quick heartbeat indicate emotions such as terror, joy, and excitement in real life, and a quick tempo piece of music will be infinitely more effective at evoking these emotions than a slow piece of music.

So now, coming back to the songs you listed, an important part of Western music like these is <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  I'm sure you've probably heard of "minor = sad, major = happy". This is of course a crazy over-generalization, but it does demonstrate how their are two primary kinds of <b><u>harmony</u></b> and scale in Western music - major and minor.  These have been around for about 400-500 years now, and while there are SOME scientific and objective explanations as to why minor <b><u>harmony</u></b> and scale is used for negative emotions while major is used for the opposite, most if it comes down to cultural conditioning, developed over hundreds of years.  Basically, we associate minor with negative emotions and major with positive mostly because that's what we have been raised to associate them with.  In other cultures, a minor-sounding scale can mean something very positive. 

So knowing this, I took a quick listen of the songs you mentioned.  I Follow You by Melody's Echo Chamber has vague harmonies that move between both the relative major and the relative minor.  At any given point it's difficult to say with 100% certainty if it's a minor song or a major song, and it shifts between the two constantly.  The result is a bittersweet mixture of sadness and longing, major with a twinge of minor and minor with a twinge of major.

A similar thing happens in Tangible Intangible but in a different way.  This song is more clearly in a major key, but it uses Major 7 chords rather than major triads.  I'm not sure what your knowledge of music theory is like, but a C major triad has the notes C E and G.  A Cmaj7 chord has the notes C E G and B.  That added B adds a lot of melancholy to the sound, as now that chord has both a major triad AND a minor triad in its sound.  It still has C E G, a C major triad, but now it also has E G B, which is an E minor triad.  So again, more major/minor mixing and ambiguity, potent stuff to ears familiar to our <b><u>harmony</u></b> and scale system.

Combine that with everything else mentioned above regarding tempo and subjective processes, as well as other things like timbre which I didn't have time to go into, and you more or less have your answer.

Hope that's interesting and sheds some light! If you're interested, most my sources for all this is from books like the Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology, the Handbook of Music and Emotion, and more.  A good entry level book for anyone interested is "This is Your Brain on Music". 


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Oh boy, that's quite the tall task for a first transcription.  There are a few tips to help you out though:

The first is to know the theory of what you're transcribing.  This is mainstream jazz so you can expect a number of ii-V-I's and common jazz extensions/alterations.  Knowing the theory allows you to make educated guesses as to what a chord COULD be, and then checking by ear to see how close you are.

Use some sort of tools/program to slow down the music.  Transcibe! (https://www.seventhstring.com/xscribe/download.html) gives you a 30 day free trail and has really helpful tools like the option to only focus on specific frequency ranges, completely free manipulation of speed/tempo, and more.  Some may call it cheating, but for a first shot at transcribing I think it's well warranted.

For this piece in particular it might not hurt to transcribe parts of (or even just google) the vocal line first, if you can.  It can give hints to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> of the accompaniment. 

And of course it's always possible to really split it up into chunks.  Just transcribing the rhythm for example, then the general chords, then the precise notes themselves.  That can help make things a little less daunting.

Good luck      
</p></li><li><p><b>ELI5Music</b><br>There seems to be an alteration in the bass line/<b><u>harmony</u></b> at that part, compared to what comes previously.  The usual chord is now *inverted* and the destination chord at around 2:08 is *substituted*.  

So first, with the inversion - standard chords such as these are made up of 3 notes (triads), and the most common way to organize them and 'voice' them is to have the root of the chord in the bass or lowest-most note.  The root is the namesake of the chord name - D is the root of D major (the chord at 2:05 is in fact D major).  However, at 2:05 the bass note is NOT a D - it's an F#.  This doesn't change the actual chord, as F# is still in a Dmajor chord, but it does alter the sound just a bit - a bit more suggestive of minor to my ears.  

This inversion sets up a satisfying bass line into the chord at 2:08 which is *not* the chord we're expecting.  We expect, based on what the song has already established, a home base A major chord (the whole song is in the key A major).  What we get instead is F# minor, once again inverted.  This is replacing the "1 chord" with the "6 chord" and it's an extremely common substitution that works in both major and minor keys.  That's because in standard <b><u>harmony</u></b>, there are 3 categories of chords in any given key - tonic, subdominant, and dominant.  What they are isn't too important here, but what is important is that chords of the same category can be substituted for one another pretty easily because they share 2 notes in common.  F# minor and A major are in the same category here.

What you're wondering about regarding if the effect of this passage is made effective by what you heard previously is absolutely correct. Our brain latches on to repetition and patterns, and when they're violated, it gets our attention, often in a pleasing sort of way.

Try voicing chords in their modal contexts. For example, C Lydian is a C scale with a sharp 4; therefore a C "lydian voicing" would be C#11. This could be voiced C, G, C, F#, C, E. The context of the tonic in a mode is the hardest thing to master. In a Lydian mode the progression I-II-I is pretty essential. I'd add extended <b><u>harmony</u></b> to most of the chords in a modal progression, because it can further the aural context of a mode.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think its just a matter of perception! I'm probably the wrong person to ask for that one! Bahaha! I really like atonal, serial music, and music that heavily uses symmetrical structures! So, I listen to a lot of Penderecki, Schoenberg, and Ives. I think it sounds great! That's also why I like bebop! It is interesting, and I've wondered about it though. I would imagine that it is connected to the harmonic series in someway, most things in music are. A wild guess would be that in the harmonic series, the partials that make up the major and minor thirds are the first tones to be technically flat. Everything before them is sharp, outside of the fundamental and the octave. From that point of view, it could be be suggested that thirds, by their very nature, are actually dissonances, rather than consonances, and that perfect intervals are the only truly consonant intervals. Perfect quartal and quintal <b><u>harmony</u></b> don't sound nearly as dissonant as augmented and diminished structures! Purely a guess though!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I really like this. You have a good sense of rhythm that allows the accompaniment to feel connected throughout the piece. One suggestion would be to consider the melodic construction. While the work sounds nice, the melody never really grabbed me and stuck. There were lots of nice moments where the melody was part of and extended <b><u>harmony</u></b>, though. That's awesome, keep doing that. The harmonic ventures you take may be better served in different mediant modes. Consider all the chromatic and doubly chromatic mediants and their modes and you continue crafting work. The use though, is so nearly there. Great job! Keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>There are a lot of skips and leaps going around in this. It very hard for me to get a good idea of what the theme is supposed to be. Also, perusing your score, the texture is more or less three part at max, with embellishments here and there. The only problem is that it starts to seem that you didn't have enough material or didn't know how to execute the four part texture in an interesting way. (Sorry, if that seems harsh.) What I think you'll find though, is that the genre "string quartet" is very wide, but players want to be heard and feel equal in their roles. If you focus on balancing the individual parts in that way, I think you'll be more successful. Also, I'd recommend sketching theme with <b><u>harmony</u></b>, preparing form ahead of time, and spending more time in the pre-production stage of composition. Even if that lasts weeks, if you stay on target I promise you'll get a better result. Take a listen to a wide variety of quartets as well, classical, romantic, and modern. Get a feel for what makes the most popular ones great. Also, get a copy of Bartok's string quartets, they have a wealth of indispensable info about the genre.    
</p></li></ol></div><hr><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">User: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/Polypeptide>Polypeptide</a><ol><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>In terms of classical theory, a progression refers to <b><u>harmony</u></b>, i.e. chords, (though in this case, counterpoint doesn't use chordal <b><u>harmony</u></b> but that's another subject).

There isn't really a term for this kind of thing but I think what you're referring to could be called in modern terms a "theme" or perhaps a "motive". Another word you could use could be that the notes are ornamented in a similar fashion.

Hope this helps
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Not bad. Your main theme (mm 3 to 7) is quite good, sounds folk-y, I think there is a lot more you could do with it. Try to develop it more. Make it longer, add some variation. Right now it comes to a full stop too quickly and that's honestly quite grating. You could also probably start the oom-pah pattern a bar earlier, at m 2, or at least add a rhythm to "propel" the melody into the following pattern.

Formally, there are some things happening that I would watch out for. 

First of all, the general structure lacks direction. You often start a lively section and then interrupt it almost immediately with long note values. For example, mm 3-6 are interesting, but then you come to a full stop on 7. This happens quite a few times. You could definitely take a lot more time on each musical idea.

Second, you take a lot of time to build up but it doesn't always lead to something. For example, mm 37 to 43 build up quite a bit but the following section feels lower energy than what the buildup suggests. 

Overall, I would suggest trying to find more direction in the piece in general, even if it means simplifying the structure. I know it's tempting to go for very complex early on but I think in this case it would greatly benefit the piece.

Other things to watch out for :
-I'm not sure 2 pianos are necessary here. Perhaps the MIDI is giving you a wrong impression but you have a lot of similar rhythms in both instruments. Most of this could be played by a single player, I think.
-Watch out for thirds in the low register. They will sound muddy on a real piano (and even worse on MIDI playback). Try to space them out.

Other than that, you show some understanding of <b><u>harmony</u></b> and I can see you're developing a sense for musical direction, which is always difficult. I think you need to push those melodies by expanding them into 8, 12, 16 bars.

Good luck and keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Not trying to recompose for you but on M. 17 I was really expecting a V7/V, i.e. A major with the sop from A (root) to G (m. 7), leading nicely into a D major chord next bar. This would be nice especially since the accompaniment pattern is the same, it would give a subtle but interesting contrast. Or even, on M. 16, change the <b><u>harmony</u></b> to D7, with the bass C natural, and resolve in M 17 with the A as a suspension to the I64 chord. this would give a nice chromatic feel to the music and lilt it up every so slightly. Again, sorry if I'm overstepping!

Also, try to be more directional with te bass maybe, some passing tones and inversions wouldn't hurt!

Otherwise, this is pretty good, I like the simplicity and the thematic uniformity. Keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>The accompaniment is fine. I wouldn't change the pattern. Just vary the <b><u>harmony</u></b> to keep it fresh.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I think you should vary the <b><u>harmony</u></b>/accompaniment more, the whole piece would benefit from it. I like the main melody, but harmonically you could easily add some simple "zest" that would make it so much more interesting. Try playing around with some chords!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>It could be as simple as having the bassline move more. Right not it's oscillating between C#, C and B, but you could easily give it more direction, by either having it move chromatically down, or jump around, instead of going down and back up. Of course that would affect playability, though.

Or, you could keep the same bass, but change the fifth above, since it stays static. Choose one bar where you think a "moment" should happen (I would suggest m. 14) and change the <b><u>harmony</u></b> to something unexpected.

It doesn't have to be huge, sometimes smaller is better, but I think it would benefit to have a "twist" or two.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Hey this is not bad at all, I especially like the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. The voice leading is interesting as well.

Here are a few suggestions, that you may leave or take :

-I think it generally lacks melody. You can always use one of your four voices to include a melody. If you really need four held notes, split one of the voices.  
-It lacks rhythmic diversity. Most of the voices have only whole notes. If they don't they pretty much always use the same note value for the whole bar (mm. 9 - 12 switch between quarters and 8th, but never combine both!). Rhythm isn't just a way to make the beats move forward, it also participates in the creation and release of tension. You should always keep that in mind!
-The range of each section is fine, I think, though maybe you could use the basses' upper register a bit more (not required, just a suggestion).

Overall I think a lot of the shortcomings of the piece could be fixed by having started from a poem. Since you're writing for choir, there's not really a reason not to. The natural rhythm of the text will help you so much to not only structure musical phrases, but to give inflection and rhythm to individual voices.

All in all, I think this is a good start and I see a lot of potential. Keep working!!
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>I'd think you'd have quite the trouble finding people who can read 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> in their heads. :P
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br><b><u>Harmony</u></b> is the total "sum" of notes played together at any given time (resulting from chords or counterpoint).  A chord progression is the succession of such harmonies over time, e.g. chords played one after the other.

Sometimes "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" is used to describe the overall use of chords in a given piece, e.g. "the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is this Schoenberg quartet is very dissonant". But overall it usually means what chord is played at a given time, e.g. "the <b><u>harmony</u></b> on the first beat of this bar is Gm, C on the second beat, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Overall I found it nice. Cute melody, and nice grasp of <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

&amp;#x200B;

Some things I'd maybe like to see more are more inversions in the piano (a lot of root position chords), which brings me to my second point, which is more movement in the piano (lots of block chords in the first few pages, a dynamic bass can help alleviate a lot of that). I'd also like to see more dialog between the instruments. You did it a bit at the end but right now it feels more like accompanied cello rather than a duet.  The buildup to m. 26 could be a lot longer, right now it feels a bit awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I'd get rid of the first bar of piano, it didn't do anything for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Here are a few thoughts. You should try varying the left hand more. Right now you're just copy/pasting the same pattern on every beat. Try varying the bass and having a contour to the right hand, with maybe even some passing tones to break the repetitiveness. 

&amp;#x200B;

In general, your transitions are very sharp. You have a nice flow going and then you stop like you're hitting a brick wall. Try smoothing them out.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I think a bit of variation in the A part can really help this piece. Instead of repeating exactly, try varying a bit, maybe harmonize the melody in 3rds or change the <b><u>harmony</u></b> in the left hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Thanks! This one was a bit different. Since I was trying to imitate a specific style, I identified some elements I wanted to have. In terms of <b><u>harmony</u></b>/melody, I consciously chose Lydian, as it's a mode that's often used in this type of aesthetic. In terms of orchestration, I decided to include suspended cymbals, a LOT of chimes and harp glisses for extra cheesiness.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I had a theme, it was just a matter of choosing an orchestration, and making sure that there was never an exact repetition. I did this by changing the orchestration a bit every time and making slight changes in melody where appropriate. I then developed the theme a bit (honestly I could/should have made this piece longer but decided to keep it real short) and voilà.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things I kept in mind : a little variation goes a long way. Identify what elements are foreground and which are background. Make orchestration decisions based on those parameters. Never repeat two bars exactly the same. Pacing is primordial, make sure there are no dead moments (especially in an introductory piece like this, which would serve as a main title). Vary <b><u>harmony</u></b> enough to keep things fresh. All those things which I learned over time :)
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Also, to add on this. If you're writing chords that include wind, try not to leave any gaps between the instruments when writing the voicings. This will ensure a better blend. In a ff passage, write the highest flute (or picc) as the soprano/melody and then all other instruments as the closest note below in the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. e.g. C on top, then G, E, C, G E, C, etc going down rather than, say, C on top, the G, C, G E etc. (skipping the E). Not sure if that's clear, if not I'll show you on a score. You can also have some overlap to make for a better blend.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Just a few thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

I think in general the mood is good. There are some counterpoint issues that I think weaken the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Sometimes you have some parallel voices that, in such an austere context, really put holes in the texture. For example, m. 9 you have vln 1 and basses in parallel octaves AND violas in parallel 5ths with the bass. M 22 you have the vln 1 in octaves, which is fine, but then you split the violas and cellos to include the melody. This seems unnecessary. In general, be aware of the relationships between the outer voices especially. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think also that you could use the bass much better. A lot of the time you're either holding one note for bars and bars or just copy/pasting the same pattern. The bass should really feel like a secondary melody, use it to create momentum! 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, triple stops cannot be sustained. Either use a div. or make it short.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Really, really nice. Simple melody, harmonized beautifully. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> kept me entranced! Well done.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It really depends on what you mean by tension. As someone else mentioned, introducing dissonance is one of the ways. But tension can be achieved in other ways. For example, increase in harmonic rhythm (starting with one <b><u>harmony</u></b> per bar, then two, then four, then maybe even six or eight). Modulation or tonicization to other keys can increase tension. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also don't underestimate the use of rhythms to create tension. The most common use of that is in EDM songs where the snare hits halve in value every bar until the drop. It doesn't have to be that simple but it usually works quite well.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Music theory is especially useful when trying to take a melody that's in your head and translate it to paper. In that sense, I'd actually argue it's essential. When it comes to composing, I don't like the approach of using theory to compose, at least not from the get go. I'd encourage you to improvise on your piano and notate the ideas you find. Do that until you feel like you have at least an elementary grasp of using theory to notate and of basic melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the question of transforming feeling into keys, that's a really difficult one. Everyone experiences music differently. My suggestion is to listen to music you like, identify what parts you like the most and then go back to a score and analyze them. Think about things like form, key/mode, dynamics, timbre, rhythm, etc. and try to understand how they relate to the things music makes you feel.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>It's not so much that it dampens the creativity, rather, it feels like a lot of new composers expect theory to do the creativity \*for\* them. Reading books about theory won't make you suddenly a master of melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It's something you have to discover within yourself, as esoteric as that may sound.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I don't know what's up with people downvoting honest work in this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, here's some feedback. It's hard to convey real emotion for an intimate instrument like the violin via MIDI. Overall I think you have a good sense of melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Both cadences at 11 and at the end seemed too abrupt, like they needed an extra bar or something. You have a lot of nice bits but I think you switch between ideas too much for the length of the piece, you should try developing them more. Also a few double stops here and there at key points could be a nice little addition.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>For an early piece, it's actually pretty good. I'd say in general you need more movement. What I mean is that either you should have more movement in the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (how many bars of Cm is that?), more movement of counterpoint (the bass note and the arpeggio pattern stay the same for whole bars at a time, it becomes rather tedious) or both. I think changing just that would make the piece already a lot more interesting.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Nice. Love the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the rhythms. Really good stuff. My only problem with it is that it ends too abruptly, it feels like it's building up to something but then cuts away just at the moment of payoff.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>First off, I'm not sure that's a Rondo. The form is hard to discern in this context but a Rondo is usually ABACA (sometimes ABACADA).

Second, sorry if this sounds harsh but this is really random. The melody has no clear direction, the music doesn't build any tension so it has nothing to release. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> doesn't really make any sense. You have two voices most of the times but sometimes three, though when/why that happens is not clear.

I would suggest starting off with a basic chord progression, two chords per bar at most, and trying to find a melody that fits that progression.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Cheers! I think you just have to keep going. This is your first one - obviously it will not be your greatest work. Personally, and I know this is tough on the ego, I would just go back to the simplest compositions. 4 or 8 bar phrases with whole note chords underneath. Don't hesitate to go for simple, I-IV-V-I <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Once you get that down really well, your confidence will increase and you'll be able to write longer parts, to transition into other formal sections. The key is also to write a lot!

Good luck!!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Absolutely gorgeous.

I love the thematic development. Great <b><u>harmony</u></b>, the voice leading makes everything super interesting. The 7:4 phrases feel natural, the music flows beautifully and the performance is very touching.

My only complain is that it's not long enough! I really wish you would make it longer. I can see this idea being developped into a 4 or 5 minute piece, even with a B section potentially.

Also some issues with engraving but I'll put that on the limitations of Musescore ;)
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I like it. You have a good sense of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you understand how to write for the piano, and the phrases make musical sense. It has a good energy and overall structure.

My only problem with it is that it sounds a bit lacking. It could really use more melody. It works on its own but it sounds more like an accompaniment than an actual, full piece. I would consider putting another instrument on top, perhaps a violin or a clarinet. I feel like it would bring this piece from something good to something amazing. Of course that's just my opinion!

Cheers!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>If you look at the Shostakovich fugue, he rarely has parallels at all. It just makes for a much richer <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Here's what I think. I'm trying to be as constructive as I can.

Rhythm : Your rhythms don't seem to have much of a direction. You seem to pick one value/pattern per couple of bars, the switch, then come back. They don't serve the music, they just sort of do they own thing. Try writing a rhythm that builds tension in the music. One good exercise is to try to find a "question and answer" type of rhythm, i.e. one bar that starts with a certain rhythm and another that follows with a rhythm that brings closure to that first bar.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> : your <b><u>harmony</u></b> is tough to follow. If you look closely, a lot of the intervals between the left and right hand, on the downbeats, are either seconds, fourths or fifths. There are hardly any thirds, which really consist of the bulk of chord colors in tonal music. Also there is a LOT of parallel motion between the two hands, this seriously weakens the harmonic richness.

Melody : This is where the two aspects above combine. The lack of rhythmic direction and the lack of clear <b><u>harmony</u></b> really make it so that your idea doesn't shine through. Whatever beautiful music you are hearing in your head... we can't hear it. It's lost because between the sounds in your head and the execution, there is a miscommunication. Either that or you don't fully understand the musical idea in the first place.

I would strongly suggest writing short, 2 or 4-bar phrases with a clear beginning, middle and end, and a simple <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>For a second composition, this is really not bad at all! It's a cute melody and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> works very well with it. Congrats!

I understand you were experimenting with different harmonies near the middle/end, but IMO it doesn't quite work. It's too different from what comes before harmonically to really fit in the idea.

Quick thing also, on the 3rd beat of m1. and all the subsequent repetitions of that part, both voices land on a C in direct motion. This creates a bit of a hole in the texture, I find. Consider changing the bass note to even a G to get a bit more richness there, I find it sticks out a bit.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>From your YT comments, it's really not as bad as you think.

Few things to look for : the relationship between the bassline and the melody, esp. on strong beats. Often you will have direct 8vs and 5ths between the to and bottom voices. Try aiming for 3rds and 6ths, as they have richer <b><u>harmony</u></b>. A few passing notes in the bass can't hurt either. I'd suggest writing the melody first, the bassline second, and then filling in the middle. Think of the bass as a secondary melody, but both the soprano and bass have to complement each other.

Second, watch out for voice crossings! While sometimes they don't matter so much, here they are quite hard to follow as instruments cross often. For example mm. 9 to 11, the melody is blurred because the 2nd violin is often above the 1st, even though the latter has the melody.

I think you have some good ideas but the execution is not great. With more attention to counterpoint, you'll have much more "bang for your buck" than right now.

Hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Well done! It's a cute little piece. You manage to keep all parts interesting and it flows very well.

My only thing is that the melody has a lot of Abs, by the end of the 1st page I was already tired of it. Maybe having the "answer" part of the melody (mm 7 to 12) tonicize a different key or be on a different <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I think it could make the piece more interesting harmonically!

Well done
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I'm not 100% sure I understand your post but here are my thoughts. 

One of the skills of composing is translating what you have in your head (and consequently what you are playing on your instrument) onto paper. That in itself is a skill that must be practiced.

It's hard to say from just your post but I think you just have to practice figuring out the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and counterpoint behind what you're hearing. When you hear a musical idea, your brain will sort of fill in the gaps of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, even if it's not clear to you what that <b><u>harmony</u></b> is. It can be quite tricky to know what this means on paper. Do I need G major here or E minor? Should the bass do this or that? The truth is there isn't one answer. I would tell you to just try a bunch of different stuff. Write a melody and harmonize it two or three different ways, or write two or three different bass lines and fill in the tenor and alto. Keep it simple, increase difficulty as you gain confidence. That was something that really held me back too.

Hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I mean, everyone has different perspectives on what they expect of music. If it sounds good to your ear, then that's perfectly fine. I'm just giving you my point of view.

From my point of view, it lacks a clear beginning and end, and yea, I would attribute that to inexperience. Hence the suggestion of going back to simpler phrases. The music doesn't really do anything, it sits vaguely around that C major chord. For a musical phrase to have a sense of tension and release the <b><u>harmony</u></b> has to move with the melody and support it, but that's not really happening right now, they are both just sort of doing their own thing.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>If you look at a Mozart score the woodwinds usually help fill out the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. They will hold notes of the chord, acting much like the sustain pedal on a piano. They are good for doublings, yes, but they can also be an integral part of the counterpoint if you use them properly. If you do use them to fill out the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, Koechlin recommends having at least the whole chord in the same section, this helps blend the voices better.

If you're having trouble, open a score you really like and see how they are orchestrated. Knowing the range and registers will also help you.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Form doesn't have to be as clear-cut as that. I had a class in University for sonata form where they explained all the different constructions of phrases and sections and this and that - but they had a hard time finding examples that actually stuck to the definitions.

I don't think there has to be discrete sections like "intro - A melody - B melody" necessarily. Sometimes pieces will have one main idea that is changed and modified over time. That constitutes the bulk of the structure of the piece.

This is something you've already started doing. All in all, I find this piece much more enjoyable than the other. You stuck to one idea and changed it up a bit every time it came up. That's great! The next step is to go from that and develop it. Break it up into smaller pieces or make it longer, change the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, play it upside-down, build it up to a climax and then bring it back down. Play with the ranges, the accompaniment, the chords... So many possibilities! I know it can be intimidating but try some stuff and see what happens.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>As u/duckstotherescue said, your score is out of order and should be labelled because it's impossible to tell who plays what.

My first observation is that the wind parts are unplayable. You never let them breathe! At this speed it's not even possible to breathe between two notes. Definitely change that.

My second this is that this C major thing lasts for too long. Pedal points are easy to compose but they often fail to create meaningful dramatic tension. I think this is one of these instances. The composition doesn't seem to really go anywhere. The long pedal is also partly the reason why it sounds like different ideas stitched together. Any slight change from a pedal is super obvious and really jumps at you so when you introduce a big change like at M. 26, it really sticks out.

Overall I like the main idea but I would love to see more dramatic tension being built. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> needs to move more and you should vary the pattern.

Hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>When you develop a melody, try to break it down into smaller parts. Take a bar and a half, or even just a half bar, isolate it, and change one or two notes. Repeat that bit and every time you do, change something. The rhythm, the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, one or more of the notes. It has to be recognizable but different.

As to creating a good bassline, that's not always super easy. What I would say is to write the bass before filling in the chords. Figure out what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is, but don't write it down just yet. Write a bassline that compliments your melody. This means favoring richer intervals like 3rd and 6ths, favoring contrary motion, avoiding parallel 5ths and octave, and most importantly having a distinct rhythm from the melody. Remember that it's impossible for your ear to pat attention to all parts equally at once, which means that when the melody is active, the bass should be rather steady and when the melody is more static, the bass should move more.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Fragment it and present it with unresolved <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Make it appear in bits and piece among different voices/instruments.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>It really depends on the melody. Often you can take just two beats, a simple but recognizable rhythm or <b><u>harmony</u></b> from the melody, and play it a few different ways, teasing is, as you say, before finally giving the whole thing away. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCdU0ev_WuI) is a great example. Kodaly builds the theme up by playing just the first part a bunch of times and layering it on top of itself. Then, finally at 1:52 you hear the main theme for the first time. It works really well.

As for unresolved <b><u>harmony</u></b> I just mean that none of the music before the actual exposition gives a sense of cadence or of resolution. The easiest way to do this would be to build up to V and instead of going back to I, going somewhere else. Do this a few times, as needed.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Not necessarily in the melody, but definitely in the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. You could land on the tonic in the melody but have a vi or IV chord (or any borrowed chord) underneath, could help you avoid resolution. It's highly contextual.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Yea, probably a sax or an oboe.

Also on that note, this is a really strange set of instruments to have chords like this. First off, you have a huge gap between the bass (which is doubled 5ths?) and the "tenor" of the english horn. Like, two full octaves between the cello and the horn. That's a huge no-no if you want instruments to blend together. It's *very* bottom heavy.

Second, you have two strings and one woodwind, which means forget about blend.

Third, some voices are crossing at points where they shouldn't, like m. 8.

I would say, get rid of the contrabass and add another intermediary instrument between the cello and the oboe, like a french horn which you can mute or something like that. Take the bassline from the contrabass and put it in the cello, and put the cello line in the french horn. This will allow you to have closer <b><u>harmony</u></b> and blend a bit better.

That's my take on it, maybe someone would disagree though.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>For the firs two bars I would guess that it's just C#m. The bassline builds tension around it but the C#m in the upper voices doesn't change. It's not really a pedal, just a static <b><u>harmony</u></b> with the bottom voice moving around.

The thing works well because you have a lot of common notes between chords and there is a lot of stepwise/chromatic motion. So while there is variety in the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, it also doesn't make a lot of strong, distant changes.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>It's a struggle that all composers have.

My best advice would be to be mindful of what notes you use and when they happen. It's possible to have a lot of moving voices while still maintaining a clear <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Try to have complete triads on strong beats, and passing notes on weaker beats. Giving a clear direction to each voice, and not having all voices active at once will also help you clarify the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Take this [awesome piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yd5EE0hAB8) for example. All of the lines are interesting on their own. But they also complement each other: when one is holding important chord tones, others are moving, and vice versa. They trade seamlessly between functional (as in, establishing the <b><u>harmony</u></b>) and ornamental (as in providing melody).

At the end of the day, it's something you have to develop an ear for and doing counterpoint exercises with a qualified teacher might be the best way to go about it.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>It's not bad. Could definitely use a bit more rhythmic variation to make the phrases more interesting. A few dotted quarters and eights here and there could help make a better melody. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> is quite simple (pretty much the 4 chords of doom) but that's fine. It means you keep the canvas simple and can make it more interesting in other ways.

Also, m. 2 beat 3, that parallel octave is super obvious and leave a big hole in the texture. Try going up to the C instead for a richer <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It'll also make your bassline a bit more interesting since it only goes stepwise and there are only two voices.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Honestly at times this seems a bit random. The melodies aren't really interesting individually and they don't really complement each other. There are some voice leading issues that really impoverish the music, like a lot of direct octaves and some strange leaps to dissonant intervals. For example, mm. 25 to 29, you have a bunch of direct octaves and 5ths in a row and you land on minor sevenths and minor seconds. Essentially, you're alternative between shallow and rich <b><u>harmony</u></b> very quickly and it doesn't give the listener a clear idea of what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is supposed to be. Try to favor thirds and sixths, as they will really give the colors you need for this kind of music.

I think you could benefit greatly from doing counterpoint exercises, it'll help you get a clearer idea of how each individual line should go and how it can work with other lines to create a whole that's greater than the sum of its parts.

Sorry if this sounds a bit mean, I'm really not trying to crap on your work but rather I'm trying to give you some constructive feedback.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Well done, nice melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Always nice to see some Shakespeare, a real classic for English composers.

Couple of things though. Your bassline is seriously underused! Your first 3 bars have the same bass. Often you'll stick to the same bass for a few beats or a whole bar. Use it to write some nice counterpoint. There are also times when the melody is a held note, that would be the perfect occasion to have a little answer in the bass. It doesn't always need to be a whole phrase, just a few notes to keep the interest going while you're repeating chords.

The other thing is that at some point you go from triplet chords to triplet arpeggios. This is fine, but you never go back to the chords so it kinda feels like you threw the idea away.

I think you have a good ear for melody and a great grasp of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you just need to start working on the details. Keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>For a first time it's pretty good! You already understand <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the melody feels like it's going somewhere. It's a cute catchy melody and honestly with some work I think it could become a nice little piece.

I think there are just a few problems. The first being that in the A section, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is a bit bland. The reason is twofold : 1) a lot of your chords don't use thirds and 2) pretty much all the melody follows the <b><u>harmony</u></b> exactly. What I mean by this second point is that all the voices are parallel pretty much always, for example, m.1 the right hand is the same exact notes as the left hand, m.2 you add a 3rd but both hands are moving in the same direction, and so forth. As far as I can tell up until m. 27 both hands are moving in the same direction in every single bar. Try having the move in opposite motion, it'll create a much richer sound. Give your bassline a purpose, write it as its own melody rather than just using it as block chords to fill in the harmonic space.

Hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I kinda like it. It's a catchy tune and you seem to have a good intuition for melody.

There are a few odd things about it. The most obvious one is that you use flutes in the mid-low range, which is its weakest range. The strings would pretty much completely drown it. For oboes it's not too bad because the mid-low is its strongest but still, against all those strings, not ideal. The strings are a bit underused. They generally carry the bulk of the material because of their versatility. Most of the time, they are just holding notes. Another thing is that you used a LOT of timpani, I think they'd have a greater effect if you didn't use them as much.

The other main thing is the odd voice leading. Sometimes you'll have two instruments in <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and sometimes in unison or octave, but they doesn't seem to be a logic as to why you're switching back and forth.

Hope this helps!


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>With 2 or 3 ideas you're set for like 15 solid minutes of music. Try to come up with variations in orchestration, dynamics, rhythm, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I'm going to comment on the style because I'm not a trombone player.

I think in general it lacks two things. First, it lacks a clear direction. I don't know where the phrases are going. They don't build any musical tension, so they can't release it. Sometimes you seem to have a moment of clarity in the melody but it's often short-lived and it goes back to being kind of bland. It seems like both trombones are sort of doing their own thing and not complementing each other, rather than working together.

Which brings me to my second point, which is the piece lacks strong harmonic relationships. What I mean by that is that both instruments are often a 4th, 5th or 8va apart. With more instruments that might not be a big problem but with only two, it sounds pretty hollow most of the time. Not only that, but it becomes really hard to tell what the quality of the chords are. That's why you need to favor 3rds and 6ths, because they have strong harmonic relationships.

In general, both instruments are moving too much at the same time. Try having more of a dialog. When one is moving a lot, the other one is more still, and vice versa. This will make the whole thing less chaotic and make the <b><u>harmony</u></b> clearer.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Honestly, my advice is just to write, and to challenge yourself. Write a lot. Write every minute of your spare time. The more you write, the easier it'll get. Books can't really teach you how to create meaning in music. Sure, they'll have some insight into technical stuff - like how to make your <b><u>harmony</u></b> richer or how to orchestrate properly - but they can't help you develop your ear, and they can't tell you what a good melody is. That's something you have to develop by writing.

I think a lot of beginners tend to place too much importance on books. I don't mean to say that they're bad, but expecting to learn how to write music by reading books is a bit like trying to learn tennis by reading the official rule book. You might know all the rules on paper but it's a whole other thing going out on the field and trying to play.

Having a teacher is a great idea. They'll help you reflect on your own process, challenge you in personal ways, in ways that you wouldn't even have thought. They can guide you towards areas where you need improvement and reinforce things that you are doing well. A good teacher will always let your own style prevail over their personal preferences. I hope you can find someone like that.

I know this is maybe not the answer you're expecting but I don't think there are any secret resources.


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Hey, not bad for a first try. It's a great idea to write every day!

You have some good intuitions. Each line feels like its own and they answer each other, which is great. It makes for very dynamic music.

One thing I'd be careful is how you harmonize your melody, especially with only two voices. Sometimes you'll use 4ths and 5ths and 8vas relationships but this makes for weaker <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Try to favor 3rds and 6ths, as they give color to your chords and make the <b><u>harmony</u></b> much richer.

Otherwise I encourage you to keep writing, the more you write the easier it'll get.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>There's a lot of unnecessary doublings. For example, m. 9 those woodwinds would absolutely not be heard at that range against the brass. They don't really add anything.

There are a few issues with range in the woodwinds as well, the woodwinds have basically no power (except maybe the oboe) in the mid-low so they won't be heard against the whole orchestra (esp. against brass).

I think you have a good ear for melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, this piece is interesting but there are a few issues with orchestration that I'm not really qualified to answer.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>One this you could do is have the woods underline the <b><u>harmony</u></b> by holding chords. It will be a bit like pushing down the piano pedal and creating resonance.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Move with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> but try to find as many common tones as possible. French horns are really good at fattening the texture. Woodwinds are lighter and can help in sections that aren't too dense.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The other comments are great, but I would say that the best course of action is to work at developing an ear for finding the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Just try out a bunch of different stuff. Some really simple (I-V-I) and some really complex. Some of them will be good, some will suck. Eventually, you'll become more accustomed to finding harmonies and it'll become so easy you won't even have to think about it. That's also when it'll open more doors. The more you're comfortable with simple harmonizations, the more you'll be able to explore.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>One of the tricks to figure it out is to find where the <b><u>harmony</u></b> changes. In this song, most of the time, at least, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> changes every two or four groups of 3 beats. That's usually a pretty good hint.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I like it. Good melody, nice sens of <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I would really suggest using the bassline more. The lower note of each arpeggio should move more, especially when the right hand is just holding a note. It would give the piece so much more interest.

Those two transitions to and back from the fast middle are waaaay too abrupt. Esp. for a nocturne. You have to make it more gradual. Introduce the fast part bit by bit.

The recap is also too short and the ending too abrupt. Again, I would recomment smoothing it out.

Keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Alan Belkin has great resources on modern <b><u>harmony</u></b> and general counterpoint. Highly recommend.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Overall I like the melody, and I think 5/8 was a good choice. However, I don't know if this is meant as background music but I found it a bit too repetitive. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> moves very slowly and I thought it was a bit tedious. I think you'd get much more of an exciting feeling if you had faster moving <b><u>harmony</u></b>, some parts with chord changes two or three times per bar.

Also you should really label your staves, I'm not sure which is which. Seems like it was written for string orchestra. Why are there two double bass staves in unison and why are they in a separate bracket?
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I like the ideas, they are quite fun. You have a good sense of musical drama.

However, here are a few things I can say right off the bat : you really need to be more mindful of breaths for woods and brass. Some parts are unplayable as is, esp. the 8th notes on the second page and that long line in the bones starting on the 1st page. In fact, I would argue that there is overall too much brass. It doesn't really show on the MIDI playback but the brass take up a huge abound of space.

Page 4 those runs are REALLY high for oboes and clarinets. Take them down an octave.

Page 9 those runs are again unplayable, much too long without breath esp. at forte. Plus the flute is too quiet at that range, you might as well not include it. Oboes are strongest in the midrange and flutes are very weak in the bottom range.

In general I think the <b><u>harmony</u></b> needs to move more, it'd give the piece more energy.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>As usual, great stuff! I love the dialogues between the sections, and you have some great harmonies in there. I really like the 3rd and 5th movements.

As far as orchestration goes I think you're doing great. My only nitpick would be that there are hardly any resonances planes, i.e. held notes in the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It's kind of like playing the piano without pedals. I think some places might benefit from having the <b><u>harmony</u></b> made more obvious, but then again it's your piece.

Also some of the slurs look like phrase markings, they might be confusing for the players.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I would suggest just trying out composing short phrases with a clear beginning and end. Like, 4 bars, then 8, then 16. Nothing too fancy, keep the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody simple. Eventually, you'll start developing an ear for creating meaning in music.

The technical stuff can come a bit after, I think. Once you've already gained a basic understanding of how to write music.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Honestly... I don't understand this piece. I don't get the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, I can't discern where the phrases begin and end. The ending is also very abrupt.

&amp;#x200B;

Also there are some strange orchestration things. First off the alto is in the mid-low register for the whole piece, she will be drowned in sound, especially during the tutti sections. The soprano only sings 3 bars. Not sure she's necessary at all. Sometimes you have a doubling of the bass line one or even two octaves above the double bass. Pretty unusual.  
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Usually if the chord extends for more than one beat it'll have a line next to it, like 6 --- to indicate that it's still the same <b><u>harmony</u></b>. If there's no symbol it means the chord is in root position.

As for omitting the 3rd or 5th that's quite unusual in classical <b><u>harmony</u></b>, much more common in jazz where you might have really dense chords and you have to leave a note out. In terms of figured bass realization I think the performer is expected to know when it's more practical to omit a note in the chord, for V7 chords for example.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Hey! Nice work. Very catchy! You have a good sense of phrasing and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and this piece really shows that off.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of practice, there are a few things that are out of style. The voice leading isn't so great (even by modern standards). Often, you'll have the bass and the soprano in parallel octaves. Try going for a richer bass. Incorporate more contrary motion, make better use of inversions, favor 3rd and 6th relationships. In general, the use of bassline is out of style. Also, try not to double active notes like leading tones or altered notes (for example, last chord of m. 28). If you're going for a period imitation piece, I'd highly suggest studying voice leading. Even if you're not, it's a great tool to have!

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, in terms of notation, it's standard to use eight notes for every chord rather than the slashed stem. It's not a big deal but it's unusual to see it written out like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Well done and keep it up!
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>Not necessarily. It only depends on the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>Wow, this piece is really nice. It definitely has a unique character, yet still catchy.

Sometimes I wonder how Ades does it. If you look at the score for Totentanz, everything is massive and yet there is still melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Definitely a composer I'd love to get more into.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>VERY nice! I absolutely enjoyed it. Reminds me of Ravel's own minuet from the Tombeau. You have some great colors throughout, and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is rich. Very well done!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Thanks. By the way, I think the reason it's so hard to find a melody over this accompaniment is because the <b><u>harmony</u></b> changes every beat and they're really spaced out chords.

I'm trying to find something... Give me a few minutes.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Sort of. I tried to use mostly notes that were common to the different changes of chords. This is what keeps the <b><u>harmony</u></b> coherent. Otherwise, since it "modulates" every chord or so, it's difficult to anticipate what comes next.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>There are definitely some good ideas in here. As others have said, your sense of <b><u>harmony</u></b> is sound, and you are able to work dramatic effects very well.

Personally, I would try to introduce more variation in the main theme. Right now, every iteration, weather in the main key or modluated, is pretty much the same. You could change the rhythm or even the actual notes (sometimes just changing the order of the chromatic quintuplets can do the trick). Maybe even switch the theme from one hand to another.

And the left hand is not busy enough, the tremolos are fine for a bit but you could achieve even greater sound by outlining chords or jumping octaves rapidly.

Also, I don't think there is a strick rule for qualifying something as a "Nocturne", it just has to be inspired by the night. AFAIK, there is no actual formal definition of a nocturne, but perhaps someone can correct this.

Good luck, it sounds great.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I agree with this. It really feels like the whole piece stays not only in the same key, but on the same <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I was expecting things to pick up, chords to move and modulate, but it stayed there the whole time. I think a nice modulation to the dominant would be easy and a great way to add power to the piece. Also, you don't need to double as much. Use the other instruments to create chords and make the <b><u>harmony</u></b> more obvious.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Books are fine, but they have limited impact if you don't try to make things. If you want to learn counterpoint or <b><u>harmony</u></b>, go see a private teacher.

That being said, I think the best way to learn any craft is just by doing a lot of it. Make lots and lots of compositions, even if they suck. Sometimes you'll get stuck - that's fine, just leave it aside and start a new one. Try things, set yourself challenges for each piece. For example, try a piece that has very simple <b><u>harmony</u></b>, a melody and a counter-melody. Or a piece that uses only one musical idea that is developed in different ways.

You have to be able to recognize your mistakes, but also to understand where you did good. What made a particular passage interesting? What made the following bit sound unorganized or boring?

Personally, I just wrote a bunch of garbage pieces until I started "getting it". Eventually, my compositions started to get more organised, I had more ease writing down what I hear in my mind's ear. I still struggle sometimes but I think most composers do, even the really good ones.

There is no substitute for practice.

P.S. A great way to learn is through imitation. Try to find a melody, and see if you can find a composer that has written something in a similar style. Then, look at what he did and imitate the voice leading, orchestration, form, etc. You'll learn much more than by just studying a score.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>IMO it's kind of pointless to notate the same harmonies over and over. I find analysis to be more about relationships than what "absolute" notes there are to be found.

However sometimes the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is not obvious if there are a lot of passing notes, and it might be useful to indicate the chords even if they don't change.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I think overall your use of <b><u>harmony</u></b> could be improved quite a lot. You use a lot of chords that are only a step apart and that move back and forth. This harmonic movement is usually very weak. For example, mm. 13 and 19, you had a chance to use strong harmonies for a strong effect, and you chose to move only one step up and then back down. Try varying the chords, use large skips (especially 5ths). This will allow you not only to use a greater pallet of chords but also to write and interesting bass.

Probably the best book to get started with is Fundamentals of Composition by Schoenberg. It’s a bit dated but it’s an absolute classic and has such a simple and beautiful philosophy regarding composition. It’s nothing really atonal btw. Beyond that if you’re going to be getting books I’d suggest getting books around the fundamentals, theory, counterpoint, and orchestration. These areas of study encompass so many other aspects of composition that if you’re going to study anything, study these things. That’s what Alan Belkin suggests in his letter to young composers. In his words he says you have to be an artisan before you become an artist. It’s like learning a new language, no one will listen to you if you don’t know how to articulate yourself and no one understands you. 

Theory-The Complete Musician by Laitz (There are other really good theory textbooks too) 

Counterpoint-Counterpoint by Kennan (There’s also the Fux though I’m not too familiar with it and some people think it’s sort of dated. The Kennan is what I’ve studied from in my counterpoint classes—I’m sure there are other great books out there too)

Orchestration-The Study of Orchestration by Adler. Basically the most up to date bible of orchestration. Has a ridiculous amount of examples. Very thorough and just a great book. 

In addition to studying from textbooks it’s vital to study scores. Whether they’re hard copies or from imslp.org. Take the score and try and condense the notes into fewer staves. This way you can understand the general musical ideas better. What’s the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, the form-What’s in the foreground, background, etc. After a while you’ll notice some interesting patterns (Debussy using tons of parallel 5ths to simulate gamelan, John Williams rarely doubling solo lines, etc.), then you’ll have a giant reference pile of ideas that worked for other composers that you can pull from. If you learn better from videos there’s great videos on YouTube from orchestration online and Alan belkin.

The Proportions of how things are located in the picture are important. You can use any system of proportions (3rds, 5ths, 7ths, etc) so long as the systems are used consistently inside the individual photo.  You can also mix them, but this sometimes requires luck in addition to skill.

A lot of the time you search the photo to see what is actually there in the photo, and try to process and trim to take advantage of any pre-existing pattern of proportions that you might discover.

In your photo the area below the horizon is 1/7th of the height of the photo. There is nothing wrong with this at all., and we can use it to advantage.

But the other element, the path of the aircraft does not quite coordinate with this. The upper tip of the path happens to line up with a proportion of 11ths. this does not cordinate wwll with 7ths.

So we can do a small tweak to adjust the path to take advantage of the dominant proportions of the picture. We can adjust the path of the aircraft slightly

http://i.imgur.com/qTkjq22.jpg

so it lines up on the grid based on 7ths like so

http://i.imgur.com/lRvdq7R.jpg

It's actually a small change, and might not make a much of a difference. by aligning to a common grid, we enhance the visual <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and remove something that might be creating tension. 

---

In the future, you want a series of shots in order to be able to choose the one that gives you the best proportions according to you tastes. With camera media so cheap these days, this is an effective way to go.

You also want a larger area so that you have more options for cropping. 

---

You can also play games with the proportions of the photo.

Most people like a horizontal panorama vs a tall skinny photo, unless there is a lot of detail in there (like a skyscraper photo, etc)

You might want to shrink the height of the photo so that it is square, for example. 

http://i.imgur.com/ysASBvq.jpg

so you have some options and some possibilities for the future

Nits to pick

* off from true horizontal by 1/10th of a degree
* lines line top and bottom of doorway are not perfectly parrallel.

by way of example

http://i.imgur.com/cGhWnIt.jpg

I presume that you have slightly more to the photo that you can work with for cropping

If so, we can get into subtle tweaks by adjusting the placement of the edges of the crop so that it falls in line with different proportions. For example the space to the left of the door could be sized to be 1/12th of the the total width of the total picture, along with the width of the right side window pane.  This is a minor point, but produces a certain visual <b><u>harmony</u></b>. You can choose whatever proportions make sense to you.

Here is an example where I merely stretched the sections in question so you can see how it looks.

http://i.imgur.com/Y1pMKVf.jpg

You could choose whatever cropping pleases you most







</p></li><li><p><b>photocritique</b><br>You can plan the spacing of things in a photo to make things look better.

You can also discover things in a photo to take advantage of the patterns you find.

Here is your original shot. I have super imposed a grid that divides the photo into 12ths both horizontally and vertically

https://i.sli.mg/21okpl.jpg

Here is the same photo cropped down, and then with the same kind of grid on it

https://i.sli.mg/lon3C6.jpg

and you can see how it lines up. These patterns form a sort of visual <b><u>harmony</u></b>. You discover them and take advantage of them as you see fit. often you will plan and crop things a certain way instinctively doing this. 

The examples I have provided are not the only way of doing it. They prove a sort of visual <b><u>harmony</u></b> that is not immediately intuitive.

As an artist you can choose to use or not use them as you desire. It's just another tool in the box.


</p></li><li><p><b>photocritique</b><br>your proportions are subtly off, leading to increased visual tension.  

This can be  a god thing, but can make things uncomfortable for some viewers 

by way of example

https://i.imgur.com/AwXcLSr.png

This is a grid of twelves and you can see where things do not quite line up. The end of the tunnel wants to be dead center, and it really isn't, for example. 

we can use the internal proportions of the photo to suggest some cropping lines 

Here the basis visual unit is the distance from the middle of the man's head to the center of the tunnel in the distance. Using this as a basic ruler, we can draw other guidelines to see what proportions exist. 

https://i.imgur.com/VP7jbcT.png

We can subdivide this as well

https://i.imgur.com/qEQr75w.png

The subdivision gives us as number of guides that can be used for a suggestions for cropping from the left and right sides. The picture will be different depending on what choices you make.  

You should play around with these. 

Leaving it as subtly asymmetrical as it currently is leads to a certain visual dis<b><u>harmony</u></b>. 

People tend to like simple proportions in art and photography. Complex proportions and outright lack of proportion make them uncomfortable. You can manipulate this to create interest, and to evoke certain emotions depending on what is going on.

technical feed back - in the fugue sections, traditionally a three voice fugue would only have 3 notes sounding at one time. and never would insert chords.

Later romantic era practice removes this restriction, especially in an orchestral context where you may have an actual fugue in the chorus, and the orchestra is providing <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

for example, Berlioz, as he expands and extends the Hosanna from the Sanctus of his Requiem

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I love the idea of Bartok's "chromatic functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" (not sure of the proper name, but you should be able to find it from that)
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Pretty! 

You probably want to spell those E-flats in the piccolo part as D-sharps (easier to read and straight out of E Harmonic Minor), and you have a few G-flats in the flute. There's also an F-natural in bar 18-- not sure if that's intentional or not, but those can be easy to miss if you're not using a key signature.

I notice you have a repeated motif (rising triplets and a quarter note). This motif can be super flexible and useful for development (think Beethoven 5).

Consider:

* Keep the rhythm, different notes (this would be a good place to try introducing some extended <b><u>harmony</u></b>, chromatic notes, or modulation if you want to experiment with that)
* Keep the notes, different rhythm or order
* Keep the melodic shape (4 rising notes), change the notes or rhythm

This is a good start, but don't call it done just yet! :)
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I just looked through your musescore posts-- I think you're right that we're pretty evenly matched (I'm a percussionist too, so ayyy). I have some thoughts, and I hope you don't mind if I leave them here since you posted them a while back.

&amp;#x200B;

Duet No. 1 is a great micro-piece as-is, but I don't think you should put it away just yet. It would make a strong theme for something longer. I'm not a string player, so I can't really comment on playability and such, but it looked like some other folks on here covered that.

&amp;#x200B;

"The Lost World" definitely stands out! The pacing is a bit slow in the first half, but the road up to the climax is crazy good. Some great moments: melody at 66, winds at 89, trumpets at 100, slowed theme at 114, timpani at 122.

Your sense of melody/<b><u>harmony</u></b> sounds great to my ears, so the only advice I have (other than maybe condensing the intro a bit) is with orchestration. Your orchestration is basically what I would have done two weeks ago, before the feedback on my first draft (unisons, doublings, interlocked voicings, brass). Instead of copying-and-pasting those comments, I'll just leave the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/b5wxwi/first\_real\_attempt\_at\_writing\_for\_orchestra/](https://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/b5wxwi/first_real_attempt_at_writing_for_orchestra/)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I would recommend downloading a different soundfont. The one I use is called Sonatina, it has pretty good sounds for orchestral instruments (alas, I have yet to find a decent percussion soundfont, especially vibraphone and tam-tam). It can help make the music feel a bit more... real?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really appreciated your feedback because, like I said, I think we're at the same level with this stuff. Cheers!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>"The tonality is distinctly A minor." I agree. The original melody (top violins, or viola) is E Loc., but when I filled in the <b><u>harmony</u></b> I kind of lost that (ugh. This feels like a really silly mistake). Thanks for pointing this out!

As for that Bb chord, the D-sharp (regardless of what the chord is called) is meant to function as a leading-tone to E, so I believe the current spelling is correct, although unusual with the mixed accidentals.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>&gt; D# *sort of* works as a leading tone, it also sort of doesn't (to my ears) and all those final E's just kind of .. happen. 

I can have trouble knowing how something will sound to fresh ears, so this is good to know

&gt; keep in mind that tonality is about establishing a tonal center 

This is advice I've given to people, so it's embarrassing that I didn't follow it...

Look under the "The Common Practice Period: Diatonic <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" section
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>At that point you either working with an inversion or a new chord altogether.  The bass note pretty much decides what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is, although at least to my ear there are a few instances you can get away with. For example I would say voicing a maj7 with the seventh in the bass is doable as long as the voices are in a high enough register (otherwise it gets way too muddy in the lower end).

Some though just don't really work, for example playing a Cadd6 with the 6th in the bass just sounds like an Amin7 and no longer a C. But there's nothing stopping you from trying, I just wouldn't go for that kind of voicing if you really want the <b><u>harmony</u></b> to be clearly unambiguous.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think it's just an impression, partially because of rose-tinted glasses and partially because of changing trends in pop music. Music may have seemed better "back then" because all the bad pop songs just don't get remembered, for obvious reasons, and sometimes the ones that do get brought back out of pure irony. Here's a list of bad songs from the 60s-80s: [https://www.thoughtco.com/worst-songs-of-the-50s-60s-and-70s-2523092](https://www.thoughtco.com/worst-songs-of-the-50s-60s-and-70s-2523092)  


Also, trends in music have changed a lot since then. Back in the 50s-70s you didn't really have the same tech you do now, so a lot more focus was put on <b><u>harmony</u></b> and songwriting. Nowadays many pop producers put their focus more into the production side of things, see people like Max Martin who made a living taking what might have just been bog-standard pop tunes and taking them up a level with his excellent production. That's not to say producers back in the day were somehow worse than they are now, there's just a difference in process and aesthetic that sets music from the '00s onward apart from older pop stuff. But of course these generalizations can't apply to all music nowadays, there's still bad pop tunes being created today, I just don't really accept the idea that music is somehow getting worse as time goes on. It's just changing to fit the tastes of the current generation, which will always seem strange to the older generation.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You are correct about the verse chords (although I would write A#m as Bbm since you don't want to combine sharps and flats when you can avoid it), I would say it's actually a combination of 2 different modes though: Cmin -&gt; Fmaj is C Dorian, and Db -&gt; Bbmin is C Phrygian. So you could say it's in C dorian and the Db-Bb are borrowed from Phrygian (look up mode mixture if you're unfamiliar with this term).

The breakdown <b><u>harmony</u></b> is a bit hazy at first although it's clear it's hanging around the note Bb, as a sort of elongation of the last chord of the verse. Eventually though to my ear it comes out as Bb -&gt; C -&gt; Gb -&gt; F, which is another sort of mode combination, with the Bb -&gt; C and F being Bb Lydian, and the Gb being borrowed from Bb Aeolian as a way to add tension and anticipation to the V-I (F-Bb) move that follows it. And then finally the F-G before it goes back to the original chord progression is more of a transitional move and doesn't have much function harmonically other than to set up a V-i ending on Cm. 
</p></li><li><p><b>LetsTalkMusic</b><br>I think maybe you're looking at rap and seeing a particular human element that isn't quite universal and somehow considering it not a human element. Like the whole of 36 Chambers and lots of Nas stuff are very clearly storytelling about life on the streets, and go a long way in evoking that feeling through lyrics as opposed to traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, melody, or production tricks. Those kinds of rappers look around themselves and write what they see.

I don't mean this to come across judgemental or preachy, because there's nothing inherently wrong with privelege, but it's kind of a priveleged POV to expect the "human element" of music to always be something lofty or deep like depression, child molestation, environmental concerns, or whatever else. If your whole life has been on the streets, how is it not human to write about life on the streets? I'm not saying every rapper has had the same life or experiences, but there are certainly very real human things being said in a lot of rap.

I wouldn't argue against there being less breadth of topics though, in general. Most rap seems comes from a place of frustration, adversity, anger, or whatever else it is that drives someone who feels like they need to be heard. That still doesn't make it less human, and personally I don't see it as a problem to be fixed.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Exactly. For your regular, everyday Western <b><u>harmony</u></b> scales, you want to use all the letters, and not have any repeats. There are more advanced cases where this stops applying, like the Alt Scale for example, but for now it's good to just stick with thinking about it like I stated.
</p></li><li><p><b>explainlikeimfive</b><br>Melody is horizontal, <b><u>harmony</u></b> is vertical. Melody is a single line moving up and down across time, whereas <b><u>harmony</u></b> is multiple voices playing at a single time. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> can change over time, but it is specifically multiple notes playing at one time.

Maybe a more simple definition is that one person can sing a melody, whereas you would need multiple people to sing a chord progression.
</p></li><li><p><b>Learnmusic</b><br>Well, it is easy if you know what scale you're in\*, but if you dont know about scales you can try this method (it assumes you have a piano around, but you can just use an online one if you aren't around a real one): first find the target note on the piano. Then your <b><u>harmony</u></b> note is almost always going to be in one of two places: either 3 or 4 half-steps away from your target note. This corresponds to an interval of either a minor third or major third, respectively.

Your <b><u>harmony</u></b> will work 90% of the time with one of those two possibilities. So for example if your target note is D, you can try going up 3 half-steps to the note F, or 4 half-steps to F# and one of those should work.

If neither of those do, however, then your next best bet is going up 5 half steps. This corresponds to an interval of a perfect fourth. An example of this would be if you're playing a song in the key of C and your target note is G, the most consonant <b><u>harmony</u></b> will actually be to go up 5 half steps to the C above G. In certain cases, using 3 or 4 half steps can work in this instance, but the perfect fourth interval will be the only one guaranteed to work.

These rules work in either direction from the target note (although it will almost always be the case that if one works in one direction, the other will work the other way, so for example if going up 3 half steps works on a certain note, you'll need to go down 5 half steps to find a note below it)

\* If you already know enough about scales to know what notes are in, say, the scale of A major, then you can simplify this process to choosing a note either 2 or 3 scale tones away from the target note. So in the scale of A, if your target note is C#, you can try E or F#. One of these will always work.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It wouldn't exist natively in any regular scale, since no scale has two major 7 chords a whole step away, much less three. It's more an example of [chord planing (aka parallel <b><u>harmony</u></b>)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_<b><u>harmony</u></b>), where you take a certain chord quality and simply move it around with no alterations or consideration for scale. It's a good way to get some unusual harmonic flavors without getting too challenging to listen to, since the consisten chord quality ties all the chords together. Honestly you can pretty much move a maj7 chord anywhere you want and it will probably sound alright, depending on what the rest of the instruments are playing. This was the basis for a lot of the sound of 90's dance music.

This is a recent song but it has the same sound, due to using chord planing in the main pad sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy-7LIxvygw
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>To be clear, whether a scale is Major or Minor has nothing to do with what kind of "feelings" it gives you, even though that's how it's often explained to beginners.

There's really only one thing you need to hear to determine if a scale is Major or Minor, and that's the third note in the scale (conveniently referred to as "the third"). Because scales don't contain every note in the 12 note octave we use in Western <b><u>harmony</u></b>, that means the third won't always be three keyboard keys away, but will either be three (minor) or four (major). So if you play a C and an Eb (three keyboard keys away from C) you've just played a minor third, and if C is the first note (aka the tonic) of your scale then you know you are playing some kind of C minor scale. Similarly, if you play a C and an E (four keyboard keys away from C) you've just played a major third, and if C is the tonic then you know you are playing some kind of C major scale.

That's it, really. There are other notes you can move to change the sound of the scale but when someone says it's in a "minor scale" then you can be guaranteed the third will be minor. With that said, because this depends on knowing what the tonic of the scale is you'll need to work on that skill first.

If we look at your songs, the Bryson Tiller song sounds to me like it's actually in the key of C#, so C# would be the tonic. The Migos song sounds like it's in the key of A#, and the DRAM song is in Ab, like you said.

Next we can see where the thirds are. Since the Bryson Tiller song is in the Key of C#, we first count up to the third *note name* above C: C -&gt; D -&gt; E. So we know that the third of the scale is going to be some type of E, whether it be E#, Eb, or just regular E. If we play each of them, the regular E (aka "E natural") is what the song is using, so then we know the third of this scale is E. Finally if we count the number of keyboard keys between C# (the tonic) and E (the third) we find it's a distance of 3 keyboard keys, making it a minor scale. Thus we know that the song is in (some kind of) C# Minor.

You can do the same process for the other two, although the Migos song doesn't actually play a third in the instrumental anywhere! I will say that to me it sounds like it's in A# minor given that we're hearing a minor sixth in the accompaniment, but that's a bit more advanced than what I wanted to get across. Suffice it to say other notes within the scale can give you *clues* as to the quality of the scale, but the only true determiner between Major in Minor is the third. Finally, the DRAM song is pretty obviously in Ab, as the first chord in the song is playing Ab C Eb, with Ab to C being a major third, thus making it Ab major.

He's singing with a modern audience, and modern audiences might potentially have more rounded expectations of music, especially in cities, and especially in westernised countries. I wonder if he's done the same thing with rural Chinese audiences...

Anyway, the point I was making was the principles of tensions and release and conchords and dischords are different around the world and have been different throughout time. As modern listeners we are much more primed to hear dissonance as effective musical <b><u>harmony</u></b> than they were 400 years ago. When e.g. Ockeghem was writing in the late 15th century they were just beginning to experiment with real dissonance such as simultaneous false relations, which we accept very readily as blue notes in Jazz today.

Similarly, the development of scales is different the world over and what we would consider a "third" in the western world sounds very different from one in the eastern world. Add to that the complications that arise from equal temperament and how far we've come from Pythagorean intervals... you see where I'm going with this.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Lots of good comments already - I'm just going to add a couple of technical points:

* in bar 3 you have an open 4th in the left hand, with the 5th in the bass. This is super weak. There's no third in the chord, and you don't correctly resolve the 4th (the F would go down to the E). I recommend an A upper note in the left hand. Notice in bar 2 you resolve the A to a G. It's not perfect part-writing, but it's more satisfying.
* in bars 11 and 12 you have consecutive octaves in the bass and treble. Worse, they're leading notes! You have hidden consecutives in 1, 3, 5 and 7, but these are less critical (still worth noting though for future development).
* final cadence isn't really a cadence. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> doesn't know what it's doing. The penultimate quaver in the bass should probably be an F and a G, rather than an Eb and an F.

Hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>AskReddit</b><br>He wrote three masses during a time when catholics had to worship in tiny secret meetings in private homes, which often had a secret door for priests to escape if they were visited by officials. The music reflects this claustrophobic, oppressive atmosphere with short, plaintive melodies and bitter-sweet <b><u>harmony</u></b>. There's a three-part, and a five-part to go with the four-part. They're all 10/10. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Love that cadenza.

I'd say it's modally/tonally ambiguous only in the broadest sense. You've just used some "jazz" <b><u>harmony</u></b>, there's always a solid root throughout. A touch of Ravel here and there.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Take fragments like you have but build them into longer phrases of several bars, and immediately start giving the <b><u>harmony</u></b> new directions and impetus. Right now it's like you're filling space trying to get to the good bit. Maybe begin the development with even more of a stark contrast. Don't have too many sudden changes of idea.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I think this deserves to be the top comment. Not that there are no dogmatic teachers of composition at HE but that the process of composition should be challenging the old conventions. 100 years ago composers really challenged the cultural status quo and music has developed much faster since then. The imperative to imagine new paradigms is much stronger now.

I went to a uni where the primary composition professor wrote for 12 loudspeakers and JCB digger bucket, large metal sheet, etc. Very esoteric. We never saw eye to eye style-wise but I have always respected his punk attitude. He studied with Ferneyhough and in my opinion bettered him.

I enjoy mixing up the traditional styles I learned to write in my earlier development with interesting processes and rules taken from my later education that I wouldn't have considered had I not been to a good university with that kind of teaching. Renaissance counterpoint? How about chant-based Canon where any <b><u>harmony</u></b> generated is a happy accident?

I'm currently writing a trumpet concerto in the actual Classical style as an exercise. I don't expect it to be performed ever. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Great stuff. Very wintry, very inventive <b><u>harmony</u></b>, lots of lovely moments.

Some slight irritations in the score:

b.24: left hand lands on E, effectively doubling the 7th in a fully-voiced chord on a strong beat. Also, the Bb in the next bar is actually an A# because it's the leading note in B minor.

b.31: your functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is making a chord of F# (the dominant of B minor again), which means the Bb should be an A# again. Same in b.33. You souldn't be having flats in a simple triad in a sharp key.

There are other examples of slight, but weird doubles and accidentals throughout that don't *reallllly* matter, but they do impact playability and intelligibility of the music.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>This would get a pretty good mark in beginners class. You've set out a simple motif of triadic and scalar movement, and you've developed it in several simple ways using knowledge of traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Your voice leading in the melody line is not great, and your sections begin and end abruptly. That's kind of the only real feedback I have. Continue studying keyboard pieces by Mozart and Bach to learn more about how traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b> can be used in a rich and satisfying way. You said bandmates so I don't know what your exposure is to classical music on the whole tho. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Some bits of #2 are good: fig.33-67 stood out to me.

You need to take the orchestra completely out of this and work out how it would sound on the piano. I think you're missing some important knowledge in counterpoint and harmonic vocabulary, and writing for full orchestra has allowed you to disguise this using orchestration. The writing is somewhat immature and directionless, even while some of your timbre choices and motives are *really interesting*. My overall feeling having listened all the way through is that there are a lot of notes but not much *music*. Maybe use the choir a bit more, and when you have something like Amazing Grace, do something more powerful with it rather than go through the motions once with basic <b><u>harmony</u></b> then call it a day. I wanted to hear some recognisable development on the tune well before the entrance of the hymn proper!

If you've got triplets and you want two notes in the time of 3, write a tuplet there, don't use dotted notes.

One last point: the choir goes above the strings in the score, not below.

Hope that helps.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Certainly not to hand. I am a lowly chorister/ex <b><u>harmony</u></b> student and have no Bach library. I can check the Passions later tho.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I thought the ending from b.67 was really powerful. Good stuff. Bottom of page 5 is also v nice.

The opening is ok, but within 2 bars I started to feel like I wasn't going to be interested, which is a bad place to be at the beginning of an aria! I know what you're going for, but (obviously, only my humble opinion), it's too rhythmically obvious, which spoils the interesting melody lines. When I write something that doesn't "spark joy" I always ask "what would Britten do?"

The answer is usually more syncopated rhythmic energy (and probably a sideways leap from tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> too).

For me, even simply tying the last notes of the phrase together so they don't land on the beat would be a great start to adding momentum and interest to the lines. I'm talking about beat 3 of b.2 and beat 3 of b.3.

There are a few subtle places where the text setting is a little off, and also a few places where it's a bit G&amp;S, which I don't think is what you want. It comes back to being rhythmically obvious or stilted to the modern sensibility.

"...surely have done wrong" is one - perhaps the text itself doesn't help.

"In mercy, Death, the Queen more just indeed would take our souls" - this line doesn't make a lot of sense. Your setting doesn't reveal any new truth either. Particularly the slur on "souls" is jarring and amateurish.

"...a crueler mistress is" - you need to emphasis "mistress" more than "is".

In b.60 separate out the rhythm in half-bar beams to make them more readable.

"man'll" - separate the 'll syllable into its own note (probably the last one of the slur).

Hopefully these suggestions help!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I listened to the second version.

You've got a real sense of scale and colourful orchestration. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> is striking but not too unfamiliar. The movt is just as long as necessary, does not outstay its welcome, and provides lots of tension and release, both on a micro- and macro level.

Things I love: how the end of each homophonic chord phrase ends with a surprising concord over the bass; how the final iteration of the opening theme is at twice the speed; how you set up the first scene in both an emotional and practical way with a sudden change in the musical texture - directors and back-stage will find that valuable.

What I didn't like: a lot of your accidentals are misspelt, making the score difficult to follow as the music sounds different from how it looks; how you've split the first and second violins given that the texture is often very dense and there might only be four or five players in each section; the fact that your three-note downward motif is *very* similar to a major theme in a piece I'm currently writing :(

Honestly, composing a long-form piece like an opera requires so much longitudinal coherence and structure that you could easily have added a minute to this overture and not overdone it. However, the pragmatist in me likes that you kept it succinct.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It works now, thanks. Not sure why that was.

Just wanted to listen before commenting because sometimes the feel influences the theoretical meaning, especially in jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

This is pretty much non-functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. The first chord sounds a bit like iv of G minor when it comes around the second time, but there's not much to infer from that. The pattern works. Where does it go from there?
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I don't have much to add on top of the other great comment here. Only to ask what hymn settings you've studied or taken as inspiration on the road to this version? Are you currently studying counterpoint and <b><u>harmony</u></b> more generally also? 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>If you can get hold of a copy of Hymns Ancient and Modern or (better yet) the New English Hymnal, you'll have a great resource for seeing how composers have set hymns of all kinds over the centuries. there's a lot of variation and creativity.

As a point of guidance, consider how almost all hymns keep the pulse continuous throughout the piece. You have some long full-bar chords in this which effectively stop the music in its tracks. Use the long melody notes as an opportunity to progress the <b><u>harmony</u></b> underneath to create a sense of continuous movement.

You say in another thread you just want to make something that sounds good without following a particular style. I can say for certain that your current arrangement doesn't sound good. It sounds fine, but not good. While u/eulerolagrange got downvoted for pointing out parallels etc., which are *technical* faults, they're actually right to do so because those faults add lumps and bumps to what should be a smooth-flowing sound. That's why I asked if you were studying <b><u>harmony</u></b> and counterpoint.

Here's a quick revision I did that fixes many of the problems (except the long notes - I couldn't be bothered lol). Compare the two versions and see how the mechanics of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> give the music the same intention but the new version flows better. https://i.imgur.com/XEO5AAX.png
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Not bad not bad. You've mainly built your <b><u>harmony</u></b> on the simple triads of chords i, iv and V, which makes it very easy to see your working. As a creative composition I'd prefer to hear more musical journey, but I guess that's not what this exercise is really about.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I saw this yesterday but kept it in a tab cause I was busy and thought it worth coming back to. Honestly I'm a professional composer now and I couldn't have done this well at your age so hopefully you will take advantage of this head start you have created!

On to business. The piece is very stylistic - you've got a kind of Boccherini sound going on which is twee these days but appropriate for the exercise.

I won't go over the whole piece, but just give you some real detail here and there as I think that'll be helpful and give you some examples to use and translate to the rest of the piece.

1. First bar: first chord is good as long as the sop is on a D not an E. Second chord is bad because you've doubled the third in the bass and sop which for the style is a big error. Try not to think of these chords as X/Y but think in inversions. Really this is a first inversion tonic chord, so Ib. Second half of the bar: cadence resolution is bad because you've not only doubled the third between the sop and tenor but also doubled the leading note in the alto and bass. Surprise surprise there's parallel octaves because that's how you resolve the leading note! Also apply this feedback to bar 2, there's plenty to look at there.

2. Bar 3: sop and bass, parallel 5ths twice in a row. There's also a parallel octave between alto and bass at the end of this bar (see bass's staccato B as it goes up to the D). This 2nd inversion G chord (Ic) is problematic because it both doesn't resolve correctly and is dull compared to what you could write instead. Consider a passing modulation to e instead via V/vi dominant (i.e. B7). This would make your circle of 5ths transition back to G more forceful.

2a. You can solve lots of problems for yourself by writing everything in slow single-chord blocks (sometimes called vertical scoring), either in half-bar blocks or quarter-bar blocks. The way you've allowed technical errors to spring up seemingly everywhere is *perhaps* because you're trying to run (with counterpoint) before you can walk (with basic <b><u>harmony</u></b>). Sounds like a severe comment for a young composer but I'm not going to patronise you with nonsense praise. You have to get this right and it will take practice but this is a good method.

3. Bar 9: your counterpoint is ambitious! Having your sop and bass exposed like this is an excellent way to pre-visualise your <b><u>harmony</u></b> and voice leading. You can use b.9-10 to implement some rules that will help with refining the rest of the piece. Firstly, try to go in contrary motion as often as possible. Parallel motion invites parallel 5ths and octaves as much as 3rds and 6ths. Notice how the first notes of the bar and the notes on beat 3 are parallel 5ths. They're hidden slightly by the quavers in the sop, but they're there nonetheless. The last quaver of b.9 and the first 2 quavers of b.10 are all parallel octaves D to A to C. On beat 3, that suspension of A over a G mordent in the bass is *technically* correct (the best kind) but is weak because although you close the cadence with parallel motion, the bass has already gone up to the A so you hear it as a sort of parallel octave.

3a. Furthermore, you've called this a chord of just G. Now, I beg to differ. I think it's more like a 4/3 suspension cadence in G that just lengthens the cadence you started in the previous beat. There's no fix per se because it's not wrong, but a better solution would be instead of the semiquavers, just have an F# then a G in the bass, perhaps with a D in between for a more solid resolution.

4. Bar 11. Final one now. Not much to say that doesn't repeat what I've said already, but just look at the alto and bass in the 4th quaver. Oof. False relation G and G# *and* parallel octaves well into the next bar! If nothing else, I hope this bullet point helps you see that parallels are not just between one note and the previous note, but also across each *pulse* of the music. In your piece it's sometimes each half bar and sometimes each quarter bar. That's the period over which you have to judge these things.

And yes famous composers sometimes have this problem too - in the Renaissance era they used to drop one voice out for a beat or two (even in the middle of a syllable) to avoid them. JS Bach has written a few parallel octaves that people slyly ignore!

Sorry for the heavy read. Hopefully you won't get scared but see this comment as a step along the route to understanding the aesthetics of <b><u>harmony</u></b> and counterpoint and, when you fix the errors I've mentioned (and the rest) you'll hear the difference and understand why composers have followed these conventions for centuries!

I wish I still had my compositions from year 11 to show you just how shit they were compared to your work!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hey, great work! I recently began doing a tremendous amount of things in the same areas, as a departure from my previous science studies and current music work.

* why do you base your work directly off of 12-ET? This is a rather recent convention, prior to which people studied tuning and intonation as a regular part of any musical training.

* instead of adjusting ET intervals, isn't it easier to just define the <b><u>harmony</u></b> as ratios? EG: your pure major 3rd could be expressed as 5:4 instead of, say, ~high three hundred something cents.

I have read papers before on the mathematical nature of consonances, for the life of me I can't remember where. I'll wrack my brain to see if I can remember some of the names.....

EDIT (by the way, I usually hate using cents (they always make me think I'm stuck onto 12-ET for no good reason) and as much as possible try to express all of my intervals as ratios)


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are a number of avenues that will take you deeper, for example: The nature of tuning, the effect of temperament on scales, the historical background that led us to contemporary scales and modes and <b><u>harmony</u></b> (which is unbeliavably fascinating), etc. Let me know if you have questions on any of these, I'd be happy to discuss them with you!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I want to agree with you, but you know as well as I do that arranging strings isn't all he did. There's a reason he was called "the Fifth Beatle". And when listen to any project that he's involved with, there's always a level of polish that comes from his extremely solid arrangements, and good interesting use of <b><u>harmony</u></b>. With an open mind, please actually look at that guy's body of work, and then come back to tell me that the success of his music and work as a producer wasn't at least partially based on a solid foundation of music theory. After all, that's what this discussion is about

**also.** Have you ever listened to shitty string writing? it really *really* sucks. Can't we just use this as an example of why theory, if only for the sake of (voice-leading/<b><u>harmony</u></b>/counterpoint/writing for instruments) is good to know?
</p></li><li><p><b>todayilearned</b><br>I once heard someone explain that if you pitch your instrument slightly sharp, you'll be heard clearly through a surrounding ensemble at minimal expense to the overall <b><u>harmony</u></b> (which is debatable, but anyways, soloists do this sometimes).

And yeah, it's interesting to note that until around the last century, intonation was taught pretty much universally in music, wheras now, with the prevalence of equal temperament, most singers learn to do this by feel, while string players are very often still taught intonation explicitly.

As a computer player, you can always take the plunge into microtonality, though! It isn't that hard, if you use software like PureData, to start being overly precise about your intervals (rather than just taking midi at it's word). :) I recently programmed my first addative microtonal synth to do pretty much that.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>What you're describing seems to be more modal (in this case, mixolydian) <b><u>harmony</u></b> than any case of secondary subdominants. 

Secondary dominants *are* used, though, and one of the mnost famous examples is from Mendelssohn's wedding march from A Midsummer Night's Dream, which goes:

     [iv, V], iii, IV, V(6/4, -&gt; 5/3), I

^(the IVs might actually be iis, I forget.)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Are you talking about his <b><u>Harmony</u></b> book? I don't particularly like it, and I haven't read his Counterpoint text, but his Orchestration is one of the best damn music books I've ever read.
</p></li></ol></div><hr><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">User: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/17bmw>17bmw</a><ol><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>First off, is there a reason you've spelled the last chord as B#min and not Cmin? B#min is a headache to think about so if there isn't a reason for the chord to be spelled that way, Cmin is far easier to understand and look at.

The first three chords use a technique called "(harmonic) planing" (also called "parallel <b><u>harmony</u></b>"). Planing is when a chord structure (say a maj chord with added 9th and 6th) is transposed up or down resulting in multiple lines (at least two) moving in strict parallel. It's a technique super common in Impressionist music; Debussy absolutely loved to do it. Check out [La Cathédrale Engloutie](https://youtu.be/cVMGwPDP-Yk) to see what I mean!

Because of the harmonic parallels, there are tons of half-step chromatic voice leading possibilities between Gmaj and Amaj and between Amaj and Bmaj. The D in Gmaj falls nicely down to the C# in A maj and the E in A maj could easily fall to the D# in Bmaj. It's not much, but personally, I've always found even a little bit of chromatic voice leading to be super wonderful especially against the stately backdrop of planed chords.

The final C minor chord acts as an excellent tension valve for the entire "progression" (in scare quotes because this sequence of chords don't really progress in any traditional sense). It has an enharmonic common tone with the previous Bmaj chord (D#=Eb) and a common tone with the first chord (G) meaning the whole thing loops nicely on itself. Also, between Cmin and Bmaj, there's even more possible half-step motions and the root motion by fifth/fourrh between Cmin and Gmaj is simply timeless; what's not to love? 

I hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The definition varies depending on context and specificity because as you can imagine, there are a lot of "keyboard styles." 

However, playing the three upper voices in the right hand and the bass alone in the left is one such style, specific to playing four-part <b><u>harmony</u></b> (chorale, gospel, etc.). The reasons for playing like this have to do (in part) with the distance restrictions between voices and the bass's ability to go as low as it wants.

That said, outside of a very specific four-part <b><u>harmony</u></b> class context, "keyboard voicing" is really open and not too specific of a term so don't take the "three notes in one hand and the bass in the left" definition of keyboard style as law. I hope this helps!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>A scale is an abstract representation of any patterned collection of notes and the relationships between those notes. It is shorthand for a specific organizational system of a set of pitches.

We can take the major scale as an example. What's really important isn't the specific notes themselves (Bb major vs E major etc.) but the fact that all major scales conform to the same shape of WWHWWWH (where W is a whole step and H a half step). Even further, the major scale helps us represent hierarchical relationships (the tonic and dominant sre clearly defined as part of the collection), specific possible harmonic organizations (tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> in this case) as well as relationships of resolution (the leading tone has in-built tension that most comfortably resolves upward to the tonic) and the organization of simultaneities (in this case, chord progressions like ii-V-vi). All of these things are features of any scale.

The definition in my first paragraph seems like a simple enough answer but is super involved with a lot of moving parts under the hood. If you look at more scales outside of the European classical diatonic tradition (raga, octatonic scales, flamenco, hexachords, jazz etc. for example) you'll see how quirky and variable scales can get.

Still, if you are a beginner, it might be better not to worry about exact definitions of things like "scale" and just worry about the specific patterns that allow you to create certain scales. All the same, I hope this helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You needn't account for differences because there aren't any, at least not at the level of harmonic analysis. Jazz and classical are sibling musics that, for the most part, use the exact same harmonic system. 

The non-chord tones you mentioned (9ths, 11ths, 13ths) are all used [quite thoroughly](http://musictheoryexamples.com/23913.html) in Romantic music. There's actually a list of rules and voice-leading procedures for resolution just like other tension tones and even cases of alterations being applied to them. Hell, you can find examples of dom7min9 chords as far back as Bach.

Even some of the wackier stuff you find in jazz (like upper structures, tritone substitutions, and modal chord progressions) all have their analogues in classical music. Like the level to which Strayhorn can be compared to Monteverdi is uncanny and unsettling. All the tools you would use to analyze jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b> can be used to analyze classical <b><u>harmony</u></b> and vice versa.

I hope this helps! Take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Again, sorry for formatting, I'm still getting the hang of reddit. Also, sorry for any spelling, grammar or punctuation mistakes. I'll try to edit those out when I see them. That said...

*"But it is my presumption that the harmonies present in jazz are either non-present in classical or are considerably rarer. Is this presumption wrong?"*

Yes, this presumption is wrong for classical music. Certainly, Classical (period) music was less harmonically adventurous than a lot of jazz but the Romantic Era was a whole different beast. It might be rarer to see these things outside of the "canon" and outside of many of the pieces you'd encounter in say, an undergraduate level theory class, but there's more than enough classical music that does have these harmonic features to call into question your presumption.

*"Can you tell me where I can find out more about this?"*

There's a lot [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_chord) about chordal extensions including rules for four-part voice leading and a hefty bibliography if you'd like to read more. Rameau's theory of supposition (mentioned in the article) gives a lot of historical context behind chordal extensions. It's a bit of a rabbit hole but, if you want to jump down, [this article](https://academic.oup.com/mts/article/38/2/155/2982076) might be a nice start. Schoenberg's Theory of <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and Structural Functions of <b><u>Harmony</u></b> also touch on this subject. Those are two texts I can't reccomend enough.

*"Can you elaborate on this? I understand you but I want to experience examples of what you're saying, because i believe you and want to experience it for myself"*

I'll do the best I can but I ask that you try to find exhaustive examples on your own. I'll drop some stuff here (like related terminology, further reading, and one or two examples) to help point you in the right direction but this is one goose I don't want to chase tonight.

**Upper structures**: Funky stuff happens when the tonic or dominant are extended (usually over pedal points). You might want to start by looking into [Chordiods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordioid). Slonimsky's Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns is (one of the best texts on the subject but [George Chadwick](https://imslp.org/wiki/<b><u>Harmony</u></b>:_A_Course_of_Study_(Chadwick,_George_Whitefield\)) and [Ebenezer Prout](https://imslp.org/wiki/<b><u>Harmony</u></b>:_Its_Theory_and_Practice_(Prout,_Ebenezer\)) both consider the subject in their work. There's also tons of ink spilled on [polychords](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychord), both in writing them into music and writing about the music they're in. Strauss's Elektra remains one if my favorite examples of them.

**Tritone substitutions**: I can't, off the top of my head, think of classical music using a tritone substituted chord as a dominant but it is common for the neapolitan to move through a preparatory V6/4 chord. Additionally, common tone diminished chords and modulation by fully diminished seventh chords are [well-known and well-noted](http://musictheoryexamples.com/26CT.html). For examples of neapolitan funness, honestly look through the Chopin's entire catalogue, Op. 48 No. 1 and his G minor Ballade being great places to start. Also, Schubert's work has a lot of wacky key relationships, tonicizations, and modulations. His lieder are easy enough to digest and his [one of his piano sonatas that I'm still trying to remember. I'll edit it in soon if I find it].

**Modal progressions**: Use of the church modes should be easy enough to find all over classical music. For starters, Gradus Ad Parnassum gave examples of species counterpoint in all the modes. Some specific pieces: Grieg's A minor piano concerto features mixolydian, Sibelius's sixth symphony is rife with dorian, Bruckner's 8th has tons of phrygian, and Beethoven's 15th string quartet positively glows with lydian passages. Also, you might want to check out [chromatic mediants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_mediant). It's not exactly modal per say, but their use can often produce quasi-modal effects on the surronding music.

*"Who are these people and what do you mean by this?"*

Billy Strayhorn was a jazz pianist, composer, and arranger most commonly known for his work with Duke Ellington. Claudio Monteverdi was a composer and director of the late Renaissance/early Baroque known for his sacred and secular vocal compositions. For clarification, I'm not saying these two were similar harmonically, just that one person's music was no more "out there" than the other's. I'm sure they would've loved to meet and chat. 

*"are you saying there is no difference at all?"*

No, I'm not saying there isn't a difference; the degree to which some harmonic features are common in one style is different than the other (which says nothing of other musical parameters!). I'm saying the difference is a lot smaller than you're suggesting it is. A lot of the examples in this post might not be exact clones of the structures found in jazz but I do hope they make it clear how close the harmonic systems are and how much they inform each other. The language of one isn't foreign or rare to the other; you can use the same tools to analyze the jazz canon that you'd use for the classical one. 

This was a lot of work but the hunt that went into this answer was super fun. Thank you so much for starting this wonderful line of discussion. I'm sorry that this response kind of got away from me length-wise but I hope this helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>May we ask exactly what emotion you are going for? With more info, it'd be easier to make suggestions or point you to pieces that ellicit the same emotion from us.

Context, for me, really determines the mood of a piece. The same major chord sounds different in a Bach chorale than it does in a Berg violin concerto, for instance. 

If I wanted to change the emotion of a specific moment I might play around with any of the following techniques: modal mixture, chordal extensions, chord substitutions, upper structures, voicing/doubling, and maybe even not strictly tonal structures.

Other musical paramters also play a huge role in determines what kind of emotional reaction a piece gives us. Rhythm (I'd say even more than <b><u>harmony</u></b>) plays a huge part. So does timbre. 

Still, it's hard to give more concrete advice without more info. Anyway it goes, I hope this helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>As your case shows, what we musicians might consider "basic" is a lot less far-reaching than what is actually basic and easily accessible to any lay-listener. I think musician ship never goes beyond what we are already able to perceive just simply gives us the tools to name and describe what we're listening to. 

A comparison: Just because I haven't spent years studying color theory and learning to accurately name onyx black vs midnight black doesn't mean a master painter and I actually see something different when we look at "Starry Night" by Van Gogh; the master painter just has an easier time explaining what he sees in a way anyone can understand.

If someone has listened to two songs of midly differing character, they are forced to grapple with notions of rhythm, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, timbre, etc. at quite a profound level. So what I'm really trying to say is extra perceptual ability isn't an advantage musicianship gives you.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Sure thing!

A relatively recent example of nontraditional resolutions would be Miles Davis's "So What." At its core, it still uses tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> but has its rules for progression, resolution, and motion. Creating self-contained systems like these is idomatic for modal jazz as a genre. It's worth checking out if you're interested in seeing how one could go about recontextualuzing otherwise sober tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

I became a fan of Paul Hindemith in high school when my teacher randomly plopped his "Flute Sonata" in front of me one lesson because I had asked for wackier sounding stuff. Hindemith's music is still thoroughly tonal but he uses so much quartal language that many of his resolutions are based on fourths instead of stacked thirds. 

Belá Bartók is one of my big musical crushes. He did SO MUCH for ethnomusicology as a field while his own compositions are often far-out, contrapuntal, and sublime. The clearest and most accessible examples of him altering traditional resolutions would be his pedagogical work, "Mikrokosmos" but you'll also find it in his string quartets (I have a soft spot for the fourth and sixth quartets).

Igor Stravinksy's octatonic wackiness is well known and noted ("Rite of Spring" has some of the hippest sacrifical dances around). I'm partial to woodwinds so I particularly dig his "Firebird" ballet (quarduple winds makes me swoon) and his "Symphonies of Wind Instruments." 

The Second Viennese School was lowkey my first love and Anton Webern was the guy I voted in as prom king. Their 12-tone compositional method throws out every rule and starts each new piece from scratch, harmonically speaking. I still tear up listening to Webern's "Herr Jesus Mein." Even so, these three didn't always need a tone row to write non-tonal stuff; check out the songs from Webern's Opus No.3 to hear what I mean.

A little more pitch-centric than Webern or Stravinsky, Claude Debussy still played with what an acceptable resolution is and how music could arrive at a resolution. His "Voiles" is dreamily whole tone and his "La Cathédral Engloutie" shows how parallel structures can force the ear to reinterpret otherwise familiar chords.

A fan of Debussy, himself, Tōru Takemitsu crafted incredible Impressionist gems. His "Nostalghia" turns concepts of tonal motion on their head in a way that's absolutely divine. His "And I Knew 'Twas Wind" is also superb.

Finally, I can't get over how much I love Elliott Carter. He, like Bartók, uses counterpoint to create layers and stratification; the harmonies that result are mystifying. I adore his string quartets (the third especially!); notice how each player has their own melodic system and resolution is almost entirely the result of rhythm rather than expected harmonic motions.

This was a lot longer than I thought it would be but I hope it helps in getting you started with atypical resolutions and the various ways those are possible. Take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>And that those other, better established concepts are easier to learn, have more and better quality resources written about them, and have use in way more analytical and compositional  circumstances?

I'm sorry for tacking this on and ranting but the way tons of people ride negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> like it's the best thing in the world boggles my mind. It's a party trick at best but so many people (especially people just starting out in theory or composition) act like it's the gospel. Yeesh.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I totally agree, negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> really is a nifty device and super cool to think about. I just wish novices took the magic and wonder they felt and channeled into into figuring out what's going on underneath the hood. But students getting stonewalled when they ask "why?" is a problem that reaches far beyond negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

EDIT: Maybe one of the things I could do is provide the nudge in the right direction. If anything's evident from people's obsession with negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>, it's that we all want to make and understand cool music; we're starving for knowledge. It can be a struggle to navigate materials and resources starting out, and knowing where to find the good ones takes some years. I'm by no means the best but maybe it could help.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> is a very specific brand of [inversion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(music\)) Pitch axis theory is also worth checking out on wiki. 

Schoenberg talks about and uses inversion far better than I could; I cannot reccomend his books on <b><u>harmony</u></b> and composition enough. They are far longer than a youtube video but I promise those books will reward every bit of effort you pour into them and then some. 

That said, one of my absolute favorite introductions into pitch-class set theory comes from the Gems of Compositional Wisdom series by Matthew Fields. The site where the lectures (word choice?) were is down/gone but you can find a pdf version of them by following [this link.](http://csmc.wonderful-music.com/resources.html) All five are theoretical and compositional gold but the one relevant to negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> is titled "What are serial materials?"

Negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>, then, is simply pc-set inversion of the diatonic collection around the major/minor mediant axis (that's an eyeful to read but it should make sense after you work through the serial materials lecture. If it doesn't, I'm more than happy to explain and clarify). 

What makes this framework fun is the realization that there's nothing stopping you from inverting the diatonic collection along a different axis. You'll have to experiment and find axes you like but I'm particularly partial to the tonic-leading tone axis, as well as the dominant-sharp four axis. Give it a whirl.

EDIT: Learning about pc-set theory may seem somewhat arcane at first, especially if your goal is making/understanding tonal music. First, the basic processes (like inversion) have been used for centuries; pc-set theory just codifies them in a way that's (relatively) easy to understand and discuss. Second, a lot of this stuff is foundational for learning more modern theoretical trends in tonal music (I'm looking at you, Neo-Riemannian analysis). 

This video is great, don't get me wrong but negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> just scratches the surface of the extremely powerful concept of inversion. I feel bad continuing to hate on negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> without bragging and stanning for its alternatives so I wrote this. I hope it helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You posted this right as I was writing my reply to this thread doing exactly what you ask for! :p Thank you so much for this question!

It's in this thread but here's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/bk11z9/i_just_found_a_great_video_on_negative_<b><u>harmony</u></b>/emd605q) to it anyway. I hope this helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yeah, well...uh....he's wrong?!

But no, really. He gave the transformation of the progression of I - IV - V - I into I - IV - iv - I as an example of negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>. But the second progression doesn't have the same functions as the first (the supposed draw of negative harmont) and is easier/better explained by other musical forces.

Flip your notes on any axis you like!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Technically, a chord is any collection of three or more pitch-classes. Just because, for example, the collection Db-Ab-C-G doesn't make diatonic sense, doesn't mean it's not a chord.

That said, there's a whole slew of terms that might be of interest here. There's isomelody which is any melodic fragment repeated a few times (. Isorhythm which is any rhythmic fragment repeated a few times. And also iso<b><u>harmony</u></b> which is easy enough to guess.

An ostinato, then, is anything that is both an isorhythm and an isomelody. Perhaps  one of those other "iso-" terms would be more appropriate. I hope this helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I see progressions like these a lot so I [made a meme](http://imgur.com/gallery/r6nNGz5) that answers why these chords work well together. Can I sit at the cool kids table now?

To better illustrate the point, let's look at the pitches contained within each chord. I've renamed the Bsus chord to an Emin chord¹ as well as renaming the Gbmin7 chord to an F#min7 chord.² More on those respellings later. I've also doubled tones in some places to better highlight voice leading potential in a bit.

Gadd9: (G, B, D, A)

G: (G, B, D, G)

Emin add9/G: (G, B, E, F#)

Emin: (E, G, B, E)

F#min7 (F# A C# E)

D11 (D G C F# [A E]³)

You'll see that every chord *except* the F#min7 chord has the tonic note, G, in it. And only the first two chords don't/can't have an E in them. Also note how, if we assume this is a loop, the last two chords and the first G chord could all share an A as well. Common tones are always cool and always help things mesh together.⁴

There's also this nice sequential idea within the first four chords. A Gadd9 chord resolving to a plain G then an Emin add9 chord resolving to plain Emin. Repitition of ideas always rules and here it's mega effective because it's between the major tonic and its relative minor; tonic expansion much? Like how divine is that?

Furthermore, peep how I voiced a possible melody line for this progression (the right most note in each listed collection): A - G - F# - E - E - F# and repeat. That's a smooth line made cooler by the fact that some of the melody notes are tensions/extensions.

Finally, I can't not mention how, on top of all of that, you're playing with quartal/quintal <b><u>harmony</u></b> as well. Half of the chords have a trichordal stack of fourths/fifths as a subset of the chord itself. Gadd9 has G, D, A; Emin add9 has E, B, F#; and the final D11 chord has D, G, C. So even more unity and cool harmonic language. Like, you're just showing off at this point, yeesh. :p

I hope this helps explain some of the reasons why this progression works so well. Have fun with your axe and take care!

0.) I can't believe I'm including footnotes now? This is a new level of...something the opposite of what cool kids do.

1.) The Bsus spelling doesn't make sense in context. B isn't in the bass, there's no D apart of the chord, and all the members of the chord are easily explained by E being the root, considering this is G major and another E minor chord follows this one. If the suspension resolved, I could buy this as a B chord but otherwise, it makes more sense to me as an E chord.

2.) Again, in G major, F# (the leading tone) makes more sense to see than Gb. If the lowered notes resolved how we's expect (that is, they went down) then we'd have a reason to call this Gb but here, the note most decidedly goes up! Also, spelling Gbmin7 is a pain (Gb, Bbb, Db, Fb) most of us would rather avoid even thinking about.

3.) I left the A and the E here in brackets because they aren't necessary for this chord to be a D11. The ukulele only has four strings, so if you had to leave out two notes and still get the effect of a D11, these would be the two you'd leave out. They would be scrumptious to add though, perhaps in a vocal line or some such?

4.) Common tone effects like this always remind me of Chopin's [Raindrop Prelude](https://youtu.be/Sh03YXzvDF4). Give it a look/listen and count how many bars *don't* have a Ab/G#. Crazy right?

Okay, now I'm actually done! I hope this helped and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm biased (if you couldn't tell!) but I'm of the mind it was certainly a mistake! His theory of <b><u>harmony</u></b> (and his other writings) taught me most of what I know, if I'm being honest. They're incredible texts that manage to be useful and insightful for all areas of music (musicology, theory, composition, performance, etc.) and for all levels of musician (except, maybe, the absolute beginner).

If I may go off on a tangent, may I ask why you stopped reading it?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This looks like a very cut and dry example of [harmonic parallelism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_<b><u>harmony</u></b>).

It's clearly got G as its center but for the most part it's a melody (it'd make a grear bassline!) that's had every note harmonized with a major chord. 

Changes like these always remind me of a technique I've always called [chordal melody](https://www.jazzguitarlessons.net/blog/build-chord-melody-3-easy-steps?hs_amp=true)¹ but I'm certain there's a more proper name for it. It's a super common idiom in guitar playing and rightfully so!

I hope this helps and take care!

1.) Rick Beato has an amazing [introduction](https://youtu.be/dXeni3cOZPk) to this concept. And he does it on guitar! Imo, check it out, it's super rad.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In addition to all the amazing and thorough responses already, may I talk to you today about our lord and atonal savior, Arnold Schoenberg¹?

He wrote this really lush and yummy string sextet, [Verklärte Nacht](https://youtu.be/vqODySSxYpc), that features instances of inverted *ninth* chords. The Vienna Music Society didn't think inverted ninth chords *could* exist which made it hard for him to get the music performed; it's impossible to play something that doesn't exist right?

This disdain for a completely wonderful piece naturally irked Schoenberg, so, in his [Theory of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>](https://www.schoenberg.at/index.php/en/onlineshop/product/23-arnold-schoenberg-theory-of-<b><u>harmony</u></b>-paperback), he considers ninth chords, as well as other extended chords). He details their constructions, histories, uses, *and* inversions. I know I sound like a broken record, but please, please, please read the text (and it's follow-up, *Structural Functions of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>*) if you want an excellent look into this subject.

Also of note, the act of chordal inversion (and not other kinds of inversion) is super relevant to non-tonal musics as well. Elliot Carter was fond of uses pitch-class sets with unique intervallic and inversion properties. The [grandmother chord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-interval_twelve-tone_row#Grandmother_chord), for example, is an arrangement of all 12 pitch classes such that all 11 intervals occur within the chord *and* subsequent inversions of this structure retain the all-interval quality. It's really something special.

Chordal inversion is an amazing topic so I hope this response helps you on your quest. Take care!

1.) Oh no, not me lavishing praise on [Schoenberg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7c/82/6e/7c826e094099a1519822fbeeace45af9.jpg) again? In case you're wondering, I'm never going to stop riding Schoenberg, best believe!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Would you clarify what you mean by Dsus4/2? Do you mean a D chord with the third and fifth chord factors suspended as a second and fourth above the bass (D E G) or do you mean a D chord with the fourth and second having their resolutions to the third suspended (D E G A)? 

Either way, I don't you should call that a D chord if those suspensions never resolve to a more traditional D chord. It makes far more sense as an inverted E minor 7th chord (with a possible suspension in the case of the A), epspecially in this context.

In E minor we have (ignoring inversions): i - VIadd9 - i7sus4 - ivsus2 - V - V7. So that would be the first reason this works: it's really quite traditional. Sure, the suspended chords deliciously obscure the basic motion but i - VI - i - iv - V really is such a simple and common minor progression. 

Next, let's look at the members for each chord. Em (E G B), Cadd9 (C E G D), weird E minor chord (E G (A) D), Asus2 (A B E), B7 (B D# F# A). Smooth [voice leading possibilities](http://imgur.com/gallery/r6nNGz5) abound here which gives this progression another reason why it "works."

Finally, there's a strong current of quartal/quintal <b><u>harmony</u></b> through out. The Cadd9 chord features a fifths cycle (C G D) with the added E to help the tonality of the progression. The Asus2 chord is another fifths cycle (the B displaced an octave) and that funky E minor chord yet another fifths cycle (again, with some octave reshuffling). This non-tertian-ness adds still another layer of unity and interest to these chords.

I hope this helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I can think of a few things that have helped me become better at creating motifs. I can try to hunt down some links to go along with this stuff if that helps!

1.) Find a good book on melody. It's kind of amazing/sad how much the "standard" theoretical curriculum glosses over melody. If you can find a book that treats melody as a subject to itself and do all the exercises and listening religiously, that'll help leaps and bounds.

2.) Often, what makes a motif a motif is not how it's shaped in isolation but how it's treated in context. The vast majority of one bar melodic fragments really are good motivic material but aren't treated as such. Studying imitative counterpoint can help illuminate the various ways a motif can be manipulated. Bach, for example, was King of taking rather bland ideas and turning them into gold.

3.) You know all those books that list exhaustive melodic patterns and scale shapes for instrumentalists to practice technique? Yeah, get your hand on one of those and steal, steal, steal. The Slonimsky continues to be everything to me, even now, just as a place to start.

4.) Schoenberg. His books on <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and Composition treat this subject extensively. I can't reccomend them enough (and not just because of my crush!). He specifically deals with good melodic formation quite well. His own music is obsessed with motifs and the idea of developing variation. Always worth a gander.

5.) Listen, transcribe, analyze, listen some more, and then steal. If you do this step enough, you'll find yourself gaining an intuition of melodies you'll like and how to manipulate them.

As always, if you're stuck, there's plenty of help to be found through the redditverse. I hope this helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Oh, no, Schoenberg analyzed the shit out of Brahms who he admired, and wrote gorgeous late Romantic, tonal music at the start of his career. 

The books in question were written as a guide to teaching students so they are designed to be accessible and deal almost totally with tonal music. Start with his Theory of <b><u>Harmony</u></b> then his Fundamental Exercises in Counterpoint. Definitely pick up Style and Idea, too!

As for melody books, Alan Belkin has an amazing site where he writes an [essay](http://alanbelkinmusic.com/site/en/index.php/on-musical-ideas/) on this exact topic. Alice Parker writes nifty guides including [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Melody-Exploring-Single-Line/dp/1579995608/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=melody&amp;qid=1560743978&amp;rnid=2941120011&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-6) on melody and as always, Berklee College of Music stays bossed up^1 with [books like this](https://www.amazon.com/Melody-Songwriting-Techniques-Writing-Berklee/dp/063400638X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=melody&amp;qid=1560743978&amp;rnid=2941120011&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2). 

Except the Schoenberg, I haven't read those materials too closely myself but I do know from previous encounters with Belkin and Berklee that neither will steer you wrong and will be great places to start. I hope this helps and take care!

1.) I'm giving amazon links because I'm a good, law abiding citizen but it shouldn't be too difficult to find plenty of Berklee Press book online through other routes.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The most "natural" place you'll encounter augmented triads is with instances of the harmonic or melodic minor. The raised leading tone causes the submediant chord to move from major quality to augmented.

And, like any chord with a leading tone (and just about any dissonant chord generall!), this augmented bIII triad works beautifully as a dominant function chord. Even with all the wacky developments/trends in tonality and <b><u>harmony</u></b> since the CPP, the augmented triad is still most commonly encountered as a dominant.

Within the CPP framework, augmented intervals had a tendency to expand into their resolutions. In this chord for instance, the augmented fifth created by the minor key's submediant and leading tone resolved by expanding to a major sixth between the submediant and the tonic.

It's worth noting that aug. chords are symmetrical so enharmonically, Eb+ is the same chord as G+ and B+. Because of this, you'll often encounter V+ instead of bIII+; the exact same chord technically but the spelling affects which notes need resolving and how.

Adding the seventh just spices up the dominant function the chord already has. With B+ as a dominant, for example. You'd still expect the augmented fifth to rise by half step from F× to G#. But now you also expect the tritone created by A and D# to resolve to G# and E respectively.

I hope this helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"If I have seen a little further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."

If your goal for score study is to understand the music in question, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. Especially in the case of famous composers, many thorough analyses have already been done on most of their output. If you don't understand something yourself, find someone who does and read/listen to them explain it to you!

That said, yes, when you encounter something that can't be explained one way, you have to approach it from a different angle. With time, exposure and practice, you'll famaliarize yourself with ways to analyze music that doesn't conform to "traditional" <b><u>harmony</u></b>

But even beyond <b><u>harmony</u></b>, any proper analysis needs to account for all salient musical factors as a listener would encounter them. So even if you don't necessarily understand the harmonic language of the piece, study can still be undertaken on said piece's rhythm, timbre, form, etc. I've found that often, starting with what I can make sense of helps illuminate the more confusing bits.

If there's a specific piece that you're having trouble with or a certain kind of musical language you'd like to familiarize yourself with, we would gladly help you with that here. Personally, I think it would be neat if, every now and then, people to post "master" works and have us all do collective score study of said work.

Take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I was going to do this anyway because I got coal in my stocking last year but way to pick the one piece with the fastest harmonic rhythm I've ever seen! :p

I'm just joshing you. Thanks for asking this. I had forgotten how much I love analyzing music like this, especially Chopin. It was nice to have a reminder. Anyway! The labels I came up with for the harmonies in the first ten bars are [here](https://pastebin.com/ncHjaVQh). Sorry that it's a bit of a mess though, I did this on my phone. Some clarifying notes below:

-1.) I called the collection (Eb G Bb) Cadential (or Cad.) 6/4 when the Bb was in the bass to distinguish it from the collection (Bb D F) with F in the bass. Both of these would normally be marked with the label "V6/4" but it's hyper confusing to have two different chords with the same label. This would make sense in the case of figured bass notation but labelling the members on the tonic triad as V6/4 has always rubbed me the wrong way.

0.) In bar four, I labelled the collection (Eb, Gb, A, Bb) as V because it's an extension of the previous V6/4, this time with a minor quality. The Gb can be explained by mixture and the A-natural can be explained as a passing tone. I didn't want to write all that in my pastebin, though.

1.) The augmented chord you found is Eb augmented and not G augmented because of spelling. Pedantic, I know, especially when they sound the exact same on an equally tempered piano but spelling here is important. This augmented chord has dominant function so it's spelling tells us where it resolves and how. 

2.) There isn't any modulation in the first ten bars. A *tonicization* sure (and a phat, juicy one at that!) but a modulation (in the term's strictest sense) requires a second authentic cadence in the new key to confirm the shift. We get one cadence when we first move to F but no confirmatory cadence after that. Again. This is petty. I know.

3.) The Ab to Fdom to Eb works exactly like you think it does: the F chord is V/V. It's not unusual for chromatic predominant chords to move through another, intermediary chord, before finally arriving at the dominant. This behavior especially unremarkable when that in-between chord is the cadential 6/4, which we have here. So yes, still a secondary dominant just with it's resolution stalled by an interrupting chord.

4.) I didn't find anything I would classify as a chordal ninth in these ten bars. I would expect a chordal ninth to resolve when the <b><u>harmony</u></b> changed but these ninths resolve within a single <b><u>harmony</u></b>. They also behave too much like neighbor tones for me to believe they are anything else. Which isn't to say Chopin doesn't use ninths (because oh, dear, does he ever!) just I don't think he's using them in these ten bars.

Anyway, I've blabbed on enough. I hope this helps you make sense of this and thank you again for posting such a fun question. Have a blast analyzing and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>*This is fantastic! Thanks for the breakdown!*

I'm glad I could help! But I should be thanking you, this should go a long way to making sure I don't get coal again this year! :p

*1) Wouldn't it make more sense to treat (Eb Gb A Bb) as A Diminished as it acts like the vii leading to the B Major? I find it hard to understand how this still behaves like a V (V of what? Ab Major?) with the minor third thrown in.*

Sorry, this was a mis-label on my part. It should say Cad.6/4 and not V6/4 (as explained by the negative first point I made. I'm calling it a coloristic extension of the previous neighbor/cadential 6/4 we go just before.

But yes, an argument can be made to also call this vii°7/V. I don't like this label as much because the third would be missing in this case. And you could call the Bb (the minor ninth above the root, A) a pedal, I guess? But analyzing this as an A diminished chord, missing it's third, in fourth inversion because of a pedal tone just seems like a really convoluted way to go about this to me.

He's done a weird passing tone configuration like this earlier in this piece and an Eb chord in second inversion moving to a Bb chord is the easier explanation for what's going on here. The A-diminished label wouldn't be *wrong* exactly but I don't think it does the best job explaining this either.

*2) I've never heard about this rule regarding modulation before, is this something well known?*

Yes! The scope requirements for tonicization and modulation are [known and noted](http://openmusictheory.com/Modulation.html). To our modern ears, the requirement for a second, confirmatory cadence in the new key is a weaker expectation than it was before (in part, because of songs like "Love on Top" that quasi-modulate endlessly). But at the very least, we need a whole phrase entirely in the new key and, here, Chopin moves us back to Eb too quickly. 

*3) How do you decide whether something is a passing tone vs being part of the chord or <b><u>harmony</u></b>? It seems as though Dominant 9 is perfectly spelled out here and resolves to the i.*

We expect different behavior from chord tones than we do non-chord tones. For chord tones, if they need to resolve, we (generally) expect them to do so by changing <b><u>harmony</u></b>. For example, the leading tone in the V chord resolves to the tonic in the I/i chord; it's resolution *requires* a change of <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

For non-chord tones however, we expect (generally) them to resolve *without* a change of <b><u>harmony</u></b>. For example, a neighbor supertonic pitch in a tonic triad will resolve within the same tonic chord <b><u>harmony</u></b>. This is a rough, ham-fisted way of conceiving the difference between the two but helps us categorize typical behaviour of chord and non-chord tones.

In this case, the ninth above the C resolves back down to C *without* a change in the overall <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Furthermore, this ninth behaves in exactly the same manner as previous non-chord tones (like the A in the first Eb chord). We also don't get enough of it in comparison to the other chord tones. There's tons of C's and E's and Bb's in that bar but only a blip of a D. Because it's acting like a neighbor and not a chord tone, I chose to label it as such.

But again, it's not necessarily incorrect to say that this is a chordal ninth. And it is worth noting that chordal extensions like the ninth are the result of historical non-chord tones becoming "frozen" into the identity of the chord itself. But the explanation of this as a neighbor tone is easier, simpler, and makes most sense given the context of the piece.

Again, I hope this helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Augmented and Diminished chords are neat because they both represent equal, symmetrical divisions of the octave in 12-tone equal temperament. You can find a list of examples of [diminished chords here](http://musictheoryexamples.com/20VII.html) (specifically with their sevenths added) and some great examples of augmented chords in this [old thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/39n9b6/what_are_some_songs_that_use_augmented_chords/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

&amp;#x200B;

In both cases, these kinds of chords usually have dominant function. You can insert an augmented or diminished chord wherever you want to tonicize something. They can replace/re-color the key's normal dominant OR serve as secondary dominants to other chords.

&amp;#x200B;

The neat thing, then, about the augmented triad and the fully diminished seventh chord is, because they are symmetrical, the same chord can tonicize multiple other chords. For example, Gaug is enharmonically the same as Baug is enharmonically the same as D#/Eb augmented. So this chord (and its enharmonic equivalents) can be used as the dominant for a C chord, an Ab chord, or an E chord. Because of this, these chords are also great at helping with modulation to distant tonal areas.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, because of these chords' colorful sound, both work great as non-functional [passing chords](https://www.<b><u>harmony</u></b>.org.uk/book/functional_<b><u>harmony</u></b>_passing_chords.htm). This is helpful for composers wanting to create interesting voice-leading effects or move between two chords with no (or few) common-tones. For example, in the progression Cmin - C+ - Amaj, the intermediate augmented chord helps bridge the gap betwen Cmin and Amaj by letting the members of Cmin move by half steps to C+ and then by half steps again to Amaj.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot that can be said on the tonal, less tonal, and non-tonal uses of these chords but I certainly hope this helps gets you started. Have fun playing and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>First, whenever there are non-diatonically related chords all sharing the same quality like this, I always hear some sort of [harmonic parallelism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_<b><u>harmony</u></b>), a common a favorite technique of the guitar idiom. This progression then, is effectively a melody that's been vertically expanded with planing. The possible voice leadings that result are always yummy. 

Then, let's respell this so we have either all sharps or all flats. I actually like flats more so let's instead say that this progression is Ab Fb Ab Cb Ab Gb Fb. When we do, the [chromatic mediant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_mediant) relationships become apparent.

You can also explain these chords as having as belonging to a single key with the more colorful chords being the result of modal mixture. Cb, Fb, and Ab are all nice candidates for being a possible pitch center here. But, because we have so many options for a possible center, this progression also has a nice suspended tonality effect to it.

I didn't go into too much detail about possible ways to analyze this gorgeous progression but I hope this helps you get started on your explanation search. Have fun composing and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No more prescriptive and mechanical than a fugue or a sonata or a chaconne. The difference here is that lack of tonality is an intended effect that composers achieve with various tools like tone rows.

Negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>, on the other hand, is (largely) something someone that was cool, found by people on the internet, and then shoved into their music creating a bunch of unintended effects.

In one instance, composers fully understand and embrace what they're doing (mechanics and all!) and in the other, people are playing with a shiny new toy (which isn't necessarily a bad thing).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't know why anyone in this thread is calling this a joke. Representing extra-musical knowledge (religion, philosophy, architecture, physics, etc.) with music has been a hallmark of musical traditions all over our little planet-ship. Finding how composers have translated these ideas into music is serious musicological inquiry and learning to represent these ideas musically is a wonderful theoretical/compositional exercise. 

Musical cryptography is fun stuff, through and through. And whether or not we like the ideas that get encoded musically, they remain thoroughly poetic. This isn't to legitimize any one school of thought but to point out that ideas we might find "out there" have been the source of a lot of beautiful music.

I won't talk about what a 6/28 time signature would signify because u/crom-dubh did a more than excellent job summarizing how irrational time signatures work. There's this [excellent video](https://youtu.be/yLCD6sJdsOs) by David Bruce^0 that treats this topic with examples from the canon; you should check it out.

There are, however, plenty of ways to represent the ideas and concepts you talk about across musical parameters especially now that we have access to computer assistance in a more powerful way than previous generations. I'm going to try to not get too involved or detailed because long-winded reddit posts are the absolute worst. But, some thoughts on how one might do this below as well as some examples of composers who have done something similar:

**Rhythm**: As you've already mentioned, a 6/28 time signature might be one way to encode tau into music. You might also use a 6:2:8 polyrhythm divided across instruments (tricky because 2 divides all three numbers evenly but possible). Elliott Carter and seum circles use wild polyrhythms like these all of the time.

You might also create cycles of rhythmic attacks, say 6 variations of 28 attack patterns or 28 variations of 6 attack patterns (I like the second one more, personally). Strictly speaking, this would a serialization of rhythm which was a huge thing with total serialists like Babbit and Boulez.

**Timbre**: A more spectralist approach, to be sure, but timbre is also modelled as a series of ratios. I'm not too solid on the math, but last I checked, there's ways of calculatinf digits of pi by a series of added fractions. Perhaps these fractions correspond to overtones that are emphasized or de-emphasized.

Or maybe you stack sine waves related to each other by pi and tau ratios to create new timbres that way. You could even use a computer to analyze these new timbres and find ways to approximate them using standard orchestral instruments.

**Pitch**: Just like the other musical parameters, there are plenty of ways to encode ideas into pitch structures and spaces. For example, you might create chords built out of intervals 6, 2, and 8. An Fr+6 chord could be one example of one such chord. This would allow you to use specific segments of tau to create pitch structures.

You might also create Klumpenhower networks with arrow values of 6, 2, and 8 and create constellations of pc-sets that fit these graphs. (I can maybe give you an example of how this might work if you're interested).

Alternatively, you might create a pitch space and use the geometry of that space (in relation to tau or space piracy) as a determinant for melodic/harmonic material. Geometric models of the whole tone and hexatonic scales would be awesome of this in particular.

**Tuning**: Our tuning systems, are, at their core, a game of ratios as well so it shouldn't be hard to shift the rules around to create a new system with desired ratios. This is trivially easy to do with the help of a computer, some equations, and a few liters of coffee.

You might, for instance, redefine an octave as two pitches in a tau ratio. You might then divide that octave into equal or unequal steps to produce. Or you might keep the ratio of the octave the same (2:1) but divide it based on radians, degrees, or circle arcs. If you were really (over) dedicated, you could create instruments for these new tunings (stringed instruments and voices are best for this but others are possible!).

**Form**: Then there are ways to create cryptograms with musical structure. Again, the most straight-forward way would be to create ratios between sections of music. Or you could have tau or pi determine key structural moments in the music itself; 3.14 minutues in, a repetition occurs or something along those lines.

**Composers**:

A.) Bach was ever the clever devil and snuck in tons of hidden messages into his work. His cantatas are a gold mine of semiotics (see below!) and his name is easily translated into pitches. But perhaps my favorite musical message from him is his [C# minor fugue](https://youtu.be/zdD_QygwRuY) from WTC-1. It's absolutely littered with symbolisms for the Crucifixion. The fugue subject itself represents the cross!

B.) Stockhausen's whole thing was representing archetypal stories and Aquarian age thinking musically. The Licht cycle offers amazing examples of how music can provide meaning but really all of his stuff, as well as his original writings are worth checking out for ideas.

C.) Berg's [Lyric Suite](https://youtu.be/GKAVN5ZUdbw) for string quartet was also full of musical codes. George Perle found symbolism on all levels of the musical structure. This included things like Berg enconding the initials of he and his lover as part of the tone row, numbers representative of both parties being used rhythmic and formal determinants, and Berg secretly setting a love poem to music.

D.) Messiaen wrote an opera, "Saint François d'Assise." And heavens to Murgatroyd, what an opera it is. It's got all the musical symbols you could think of like birdsongs used as leitmotifs in the vein of Wagner and synasthetic associations of <b><u>harmony</u></b> and color. Particularly worth checking out just to be blown away by the majesty of it all.

**Theories**: Beyond that, there are some new(ish) theoretical models that you might want to check out as they could help you conceptualize existing musical parameters in a way that helps you create music representative of these ideas.

In particular, I would reccomend a dive into musical semiology, the narrative analysis of music. Fundamental to the theory is that music is a discursive practice and that "gestures" or "topics" derive their power through cultural association. I'm a fan because it sets the basis for decolonized musical analytical paradigms and I'm a sl** for story telling (especially when it comes to Chopin's ballades!^1).

You might look into what associations or gestures exist for piracy, the ocean/space, voyage, and equality and see if there aren't narrative ways to represent those concepts in your own music and doing so without abandoning our inherited musical system.

As usual, I've written WAY more than I planned to but this was such a cool inquiry, it really got me going! Whatever you do, I would definitely check out transcendental number theory as well as the history of and the various associations for these values/ideas. There's so much to this topic and I had to leave so much fun stuff out but I still hope this post does justice to what's possible with musical symbolism.

I can't say I'm much of Tauarchist myself (I'm more of a Champernowne girl :p) and I haven't said much beyond "use the ratios!" but I still hope this gave you something to think about on your musical cryptographical journey, fellow space pirate. I hope this helps. Thanks for posting and take care!

0.) Totally unrelated to anything in this thread, but I have a huge crush on David Bruce which is part of the reason I'm linking this video.

1.) It might be worth checking out tone-poems in general because it's a genre that lends itself to narrative analysis. Chopin's piano ballades are close-ish but Schoenberg's Verklärte Nacht or Rachmaninov's Isle of the Dead are two exemplary tone poems. Just something else to think about.

EDIT: Making edits for any mechanical errors I find! Sorry!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I wish it were possible to create a moratorium on the term "negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>." So many bad, lackluster, and unthorough explanations for it abound that it becomes more confusing than it ought to be (and it was already confusing enough on its own!).

Yes, you are right. Negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>, as a function, is inversional. When you apply negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> to a chord, you'll get it's "opposite." If you apply it again to the opposite, you'll get the original chord.

This is because negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> **is** inversion, so the process works as a mirror, pairing notes together to determine what each pitch's "negative" is. This [chart](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rlxzP.png) shows how this process works in the key of C. For any pitch on the left, negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> will substitute it for the pitch horizontally to the right.

So if you have the pitch G, negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> will morph it into C. The pitches G, B, D (a G major chord) morph into C, Ab, and F (an F minor chord). But negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> will also turn the pitches F, Ab, and C into D, B G. It's a mirror that flips and flops depending on what's being inputted.

It's actually, imo, a really elegant way to visualize and manipulate the full chromatic pitch space while maintaining a strong gravity to a tonal center. But there are other theories capable of explaining this exact process while being  less confusing, more widely applicable, and more powerful than negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Firstly, the concept of [modal](http://openmusictheory.com/modalMixture.html) [mixture](http://musictheoryexamples.com/mixture.html) explains *a lot* of the reason why negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> works. And it's also worth pointing out that negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> is just a specialized application of [inversion](http://openmusictheory.com/inversion.html) (in the sense that Schoenberg and Forte used the term). I can't over recommend readings [primers](http://www.jaytomlin.com/music/settheory/help.html) on musical set theory.

Whatever the case, I believe you'll be better served and less confused by looking at these other explanations, especially because negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> is such a niche technique with relatively limited applications, especially in comparison to other stuff out there. I do really want that wholesale ban on any discussion of negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> though T_T. Still, I hope this helps and take care.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Figured bass always works from a written bass note. In this case, F# is (or would be) the written bass note so there's no need for a figure that tells the performer this pitch has been chromatically altered because the player would clearly see the accidental.

Furthermore, bass figures don't care about key but rather intervals above a given note. Seeing #8 as a figure tells the performer to play an augmented octave above the written bass pitch (which is really weird!)^1. This figure *doesn't* tell the performer to raise the tonic of the given key.

As for notating diminished chords, specifically, one would create figures for the desired intervals above the root. A root position diminished chord, therefore, would be fully figured as b5/b3. 

In practice, of course, shortcuts exist. It's often enough to simply write b5 as the figure as the minor third above the bass would be implied. Depending on voice motion and context, you might even get away with writing a diminished chord with no figures at all!^2

Still, I think the most sober, clearest, and simplest way to show a diminished chord is with the figure b5. I hope this helps and take care!

1.) Augmented octaves aren't a part of any traditional harmonic structure that I know so it would be *really* weird to see one notated in figured bass and would probably confuse the performer.

2.) This would be an ultra-exceptional case. If the bass note is identified as a leading tone and the melody confirms that this the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is diminished (by showing a tritone resolution, for example), then the performer could easily infer what <b><u>harmony</u></b> is desired here (an applied leading tone chord). But we'd most certainly still add the b5 or b5/b3 figure anyway just to make it clear.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I mean, there isn't really. At least at any audible level, there isn't really any difference. As you realized, the "nega-scale" is simply the parallel mode of the original. And all negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> does is offer one way to think about moving between these parallels.

There's a case to be made that negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> creates specific functions and has specific goals. But there'a nothing that precludea modal mixture from having those same functions and goals.

Again, I really want humanity to collectively declare a moratorium on negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> and this is just one of the reasons why. Still, I hope this helps and take care!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I know I'm going to sound like a basic Schoenberg stan when I say this, but have you read Schoenberg?^1 I think his most enduring legacy is the amazing pedagogical materials he left behind that take a wholistic and integrated approach to both Classical <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the various new musics that arose during the 20th century. 

Specifically, he has this concept of "developing variation" that proposes that development and variation are (or should be) two sides of the same coin. This concept gives him a means to judge the effectiveness of a composition; the interrelatedness and variety of rhythmic, melodic, harmonic, formal, and textural dimensions within a piece would determine whether or not said piece was "good."

This gets at ideas of what is means for a piece of music to have "logic," and I think this logic is the key to creating music that captures and maintains interest. Some questions one might ask when concerned about musical logic and achieving unity through variety:

Does the music start with some interesting idea? Does the music present a set of rules or normative behaviours that can be obeyed by this idea? Does the application of these rules to said idea allow for variation and diversity? Are these variations appreciably different yet still audibly linked? And does the presentation of this developed and varied idea make structural and formal sense?

Schoenberg uses Brahms as an archetypal example of developing variation in action but I adore this particularly powerful/titanic piano[ sonata by Liszt](https://youtu.be/VCHE-UPwBJA) that exemplifies the principle just as well. Just a handful of musical ideas are endlessly transformed create half an hour of music! And it's both the familiarity of the ideas and the new ways they are presented that creates enough contrast, drama, and interest to keep a listener entertained for the entire piece.

So I would say that's the key to creating musical interest: present an idea and develop the appropriate possible variations of that idea. The familiarity ensures we listeners don't get lost and the variation ensures we don't get bored. Have fun composing and take care!

1.) #ReadSchoenberg2k19. His Theory of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, his Structural Functions of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, his Fundamentals of Musical Composition, and also his Style and Idea. Especially his Style and Idea (as it relates to this topic). These are endlessly wonderful books, periodt.

2.) Also, I've found it helpful to compose with developing variation in mind. For me the process is 1.) What is an interesting musical idea? 2.) What are the possible ways this idea can be varied? 3.) How can those variations be ordered satisfactorily? Also great questions for analysis too!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm truthfully not trying to start anything but I'm genuinely curious how you're using the term "common tone diminished" chord and why half diminshed chords are categorically excluded from being labelled as such.

This has been sending me into orbit because it's been so hard to find thorough resources on exactly what a common-tone diminished chord is, how they behave, and if there are any restrictions for their use.

Wikipedia notes that half-diminished seventh chords share all the same functions as their fully diminished counterparts but I obviously won't take Wikipedia as law on these matters.

The wiki article did point me to [this theory text](https://books.google.com/books/about/<b><u>Harmony</u></b>.html?id=Ybk3AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button) that talks about some of the alternative uses for the German aug.6 and the half diminished chord (inversionally related). Example 188 on page 139 shows one such alternative function of the half-diminished chord behaving *exactly* as it does in this query. It goes on to mention how it's related to the augmented sixth.

This [article](http://brunojazz.com/vt-half-diminished.htm) mentions how jazz cats^1 have commonly reinterpreted the half-diminished chord as a minor chord with an added major sixth and use it as such. It's also worth [noting](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-possible-tonal-functions-of-a-half-diminished-seventh-chord) that the iiø7 - V motion that occurs in the minor mode also models common-tone diminished behaviour.

I tried to look for resources that confirm your stance that the common-tone diminished chord *must* be fully diminished and *must* have the tonic of the following chord as the common tone. I stumbled on this [reddit thread](https://amp.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1oed8s/the_common_tone_diminished_chord/) that says they are *usually* fully diminished but needn't be.

From there, I tried to find/divine the historical/practical reasons for the proposed restrictions on the label of "common tone diminished chord" and came up dry. All I really got was Wagner very blatantly using half-diminished chords in this manner. I did find [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/75og2k/dim7_functions_and_terms_quickie/doafqj6) lamenting on this very same confusion. Perhaps my willingness to admit a broader definition of the term is because I'm still wet behind the ears?

Again, I'm really not trying to start any but I'm very flipped around because I thought I might've learned this concept wrong. If you could tell me why you only refer to fully diminished chords with the root at the common tone as "common tone diminished chords" that would really help my understanding of the topic. Sorry to be such a nuisance but I do hope you're having a great day?

1.) I actually don't like cats but "jazz pups" sounds weird (if adorable!). Are there any alternative animal references for those of us with feline allergies?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Some thoughts I had about how I approached analyzing this passage after a quick look/listen through:

1.) First, I noticed the non-harmonic content. The instrumentation looks like each instrument has been assigned a role and the rhythms they have reflect these jobs. The harp in particular, most clear articulates the <b><u>harmony</u></b> in any bar so I'd pay special attention to what it's doing.

2.) Next, I see that the bowed strings are heavily contrapuntal. The primary concern for this passage seems to be <b><u>harmony</u></b> rather than line. This isn't to say Mahler doesn't care about <b><u>harmony</u></b> (c'mon, it's freaking Mahler!) but rather the harmonies here are clearly a consequence of lines in dialogue.

3.) Related to the focus on counterpoint, I'd expect to see plenty of non-chord tones decorating this passage so I'll be on the look-out for any fishy notes to see if they can't be explained some other way before calling them integral to the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

With that said, here's [the analysis](https://pastebin.com/TuJwJbxH) I came up with. Some thoughts on places we've disagreed:

A.) I agree that the opening implies a tonic sound. But I have trouble calling it an F chord when there are no F's in the chord especially when the submediant can have (and often does have!) tonic function.

B.) I take issue with your label of the chord in bar 4 as IV. When does a IV chord in the key of F have the notes Bb, C, D, and G?! Furthermore, it's behaving exactly like we expect from a V chord. Sure, it's...quirky^1 but if it walks like a duck, right? The label we give this chord should honor how it's acting.

C.) For the same reasons, I have problems with your label of the chord in bar 5 as IV/V. This chord isn't apart of a tonicizing move to C. So if it's not acting like a IV chord, why call it one? Also applied subdominant chords are exceptional; they do happen but are still weird. Exceptional labels need exceptional reasons.

D.) That brings me to the V/V label you have in bar 6. Again, we aren't moving to C so why the applied label? As for the chord quality (major instead of the expected minor), that's easily explained by the melody. C to B to Bb because chromatic descent is always yummy. So the major chord isn't because of applied function but a consequence of linear motion.

E.) You missed the passing leading tone chord in bar 8. Up to this point, the harp has *never* played a non-chord tone and, even though it happens quickly, it does form a sensical chord that functions how we'd expect it to. Given all this context, why not label it as it's own <b><u>harmony</u></b>?

I hope all of this makes sense and helps. I'm always excited to see queries like these around these parts. Don't get me wrong, I love chatting about chord progressions as much as the next girl but I'd much rather curl up with a glass of lemonade and a Mahler score. Have fun analyzing and take care!

1.) These suspensions and appogiaturas were the reason you see a few question marks in my labels. It's not that I'm confused as to the identity of the chord but rather the chord quality is less normal than usual.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's short for "suspended" or "suspension." A [suspension](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonchord_tone#Suspension) is a specific kind of non-chord tone; it is first sounded as a consonance of the previous <b><u>harmony</u></b>, held over when the chord changes becoming a dissonsnce, and resolves when it moves by step to a consonance of the new <b><u>harmony</u></b>. You can find plenty of examples of them [here](http://musictheoryexamples.com/17RE.html).

Over time however, historical non-chord tones became "frozen" or "stuck" and got reanalyzed as new consonances. This happened with the suspensions where now (as one example of this process), "sus" chords are considered their own kind of <b><u>harmony</u></b> rather than a dissonance to be resolved.

Specifically, "sus" chords refer to suspensions of the chordal third. For example, a Gbsus4 chord means that instead of Bb (the chordal third), you have Cb (the fourth above Gb). F#sus2 would replace A# (the chordal third) with G# (the second above F#).

I hope this helps and take care!

Another nice way is with a slightly chromatic <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
What if i use the V of V as if it's the V instead of the ii? We can create a bunch of cool melodies from that tritone. I find a nice Beatlesque progression I,II,IV,V,  to fit your description.

I recommend [Dolmetch](http://www.dolmetsch.com/introduction.htm) for a very nice structured online music dictionary and text. I've linked it too the introduction and you can start wherever you see fit. It's also numbered in a convenient way for beginner to intermediate.

The more you explore, the more you'll want to read about what actual composers had to say. Tchaikovsky wrote his own book on <b><u>harmony</u></b> ; Same with Schoenberg.

Walter piston is another great mind that will help with that subject, whether you agree with his books on <b><u>harmony</u></b> or not.

One last thing. A man named [Alan Belkin] (http://alanbelkinmusic.com/site/en/index.php/introduction/) has an excellent web series on multiple musical issues related to composition, along with excercises to help out. His little Ebooks are free and he responds very well to emails.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I've heard it referred to as an appogutura chord. A neat concept.

The concept revolves around the bass arriving on the tonic before the rest of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> does. It differs from an anticipation because it isn't approached melodically. 

You can also think of him suspending the top voice against the tonic bass.

Here's a harmonic analysis of that moment if you're interested.

If so, just copy and paste the rhythm from the first measure however many times is necessary and be done with it!

In percussion parts, where there's just rhythm, the "simile" mark (./.) us used for exact rhythmic repeats.

So I suppose if the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is changing but the pitches aren't written on the staff, it would be "an acceptable solution" be it "proper" or not. I think everyone would get what you mean which is the important part!

Traditionally people would put in things like "continue rhythm" or "simile" or some similar verbal instruction if they didn't have something less specific ("jazz waltz") at the beginning.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, the answer I usually give for things like this is - "the answer is in the music"!

By that I mean - go and listen to some music! You know "a picture is worth a thousand words" right? Well "a sound is worth a thousand words" - don't ask on a "word" forum, but go directly to the source and find Videos on YT or similar (or audio files) that have the same kind of group and see what they did!

Usually, you just have to modify things or leave things out. But I would say, probably the LH of the Piano is going to be relegated to playing bass lines mostly, and either the RH of the piano or the guitar will probably supply the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Whichever one isn't doing the <b><u>harmony</u></b> will play the melody.
And it really depends on the song - some songs lend themselves well to playing almost "as is", while others will need to be modified a lot more.
I play in a trio with the same instrumentation (and played in another previously) and we play "pop/rock standards" and some light jazz. Jazz is much more forgiving than the rock songs, which we tend to want to cover note for note as much as is practical. When we play "Louie Louie", we just play it pretty much like the record - the only thing different is that the bass is covered by the keyboard LH. Honestly, in this group, the pianist kind of plays the song as if he was by himeself and covers whatever he can. The drummer adds drums of course, and I either double the chord progression, or play lead lines or licks, etc. Even if we play a song like "Amie" by Pure Prairie League, which is all guitars (many of them) in the original, he just basically plays one of the guitar parts on the keys while I do the leads. Now we sing so we don't have to do vocal melodies on instruments so that makes that aspect a little easier
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I couldn't listen to your clip before but just did. What is being played here is not the original <b><u>harmony</u></b> or bass line to either song. It's some "made up" bass line (implying <b><u>harmony</u></b>) with the melody to each song put over top. But since it's not the original bass line and <b><u>harmony</u></b> from "The Entertainer" as written by Scott Joplin (the original composer) it's not an accurate statement to say it's a variation of that, becuase that's not even what's being played.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There is no "theory" here. How did you come up with it - THAT is the theory!
It is a "Sequence" - Am - Ab - Eb is then repeated a whole step down. Traditional, Sequences have been seen as a "justification" for using chord progressions that aren't functional (though sequences may also be functional). But it's a "non-functional progression" and "theory" in terms of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> doesn't apply.
Each pair of chords shares common tones - C in the first 2, Eb in the 2nd 2, then both Bb and G in the next, then as a sequence, those repeat. That gives the progression some sort of "internal logic". So you probably are more correct in saying that there's an "Algorithm" that "generates" this progression.
You're Biology teacher is probably ecstatic to find out you were working with Sequences, but then disheartened to find out they weren't DNA, but music... At leas there's a D and A in there though...

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>They are often called the "Tonal Degrees".

In contrast, the other degrees (2, 3, 6, and 7) are called "Modal Degrees".

The Tonal Degrees define the key, while the Modal Degrees define the "mode" (in this case, the "type" of scale - Major or Minor, as opposed to modes specifically).

You might also look up "Tendency Tones" as these words sometimes appear in conjunction with them. Likewise, sometimes they're spoken of less as scale degrees and more of as ROOTS of harmonies on those degrees, and in that case they're often called things like "Pillars of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" or "Guideposts" or words similar to that. But those are pretty generic terms. It seems like Schoeberg had a word for them but I can't remember off the top of my head.

I think it depends on the context but Tonal Degrees would be apt if there's a "weak degree" contrasted with it in what you're translating.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I enjoyed looking at your analysis. This is actually a really good way of identifying "trends". Some of what you've discovered are broader musical trends. For example, your "arrival at the same note" is really a MAJOR aspect of what we call Tonality, or Tonal Music, or music from the "Common Practice Period" (or era).

The "range" of a melody has an ancient term called "ambitus" which comes from Latin from old Gregorian Chant. Most "singable" melodies (GC was sung) have a smaller ambitus or range because most people can't sing huge ranges (though Paul could!). As a result, many melodies stay within the same general range - an 8ve, or an 8ve plus a 3rd. This can drastically vary from song to song but looking at billions of songs in existence it would be easy to find two with relatively short searching that were the same range and register.
The "upward trend" is called "Melodic Contour" and simply describes the general direction a melody takes. Very often, ascent is associated with building tension, while descent is seen as a release, especially after a high point that is the climax. However, contours also vary widely - if you know "I am the Walrus", the melody sticks on one single note for a very long time "releasing" at the end of the phrase, more like "out of breath" - however, you could easily compare it to many Gregorian Chants that use a "reciting tone" (the "bring out your dead" scene in Monty Python's Holy Grail is a nice pop culture reference) and then descends to a "final".

"Joy to the World" has a different contour - it starts high and goes down an octave, and then climbs back up again. "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" starts high (though it leaps from a low note) and gradually descends (to that same low note) which has a feeling of "settling in" and "calming down", or maybe even more literally, the "arc" of the rainbow! But next part starts with a "waver" and is generally "static" for a bit.

In Tonal Music, especially of the Common Practice Period (which is "classical" music), there is a general tendency to move from a higher note to settle on to the tonic - but this can be extended over an entire work, with individual melodies and "nested contours" throughout.

All of these things are what we call "Elements of the Style" and pieces written in a CPP style (or styles indebted to that) share many characteristics.

So you're kind of doing what many analysts did decades ago - go though and compare a bunch of music and see how one piece was similar to another, or dissimilar, and how many pieces adhered to or didn't adhere to these characteristics.

There is a theorist named Schenker who basically "stripped away" all the embellishments in CPP music and showed us the underlying basic framework. What you've done is sort of looked at some surface elements (stripping away the <b><u>harmony</u></b> in this example) and found how - at least these two songs - have commonalities. If you were to do this with 100 songs that were all similar, you'd see definite trends develop. One of those would be, if you transposed them all to C, is that a vast amount of them will all "arrive at the same note" - the Tonic - which is a definition of Tonality!

Another is that that tonic is likely to preceded with a melody note a step above or a step below. The farther a note is away from the tonic, the less likely it is to lead to it.

You would also find (if you were looking at <b><u>harmony</u></b>) not only would a huge amount of pieces end on the tonic chord, but the chord preceding that would be a Dominant chord.

So yes, as you said, these are a matter of "genre" (or stylistic) conventions (which sometime do get used so much as to become cliches).

Janis Joplin - classic!
</p></li><li><p><b>extendedmusictheory</b><br>Old thread. Interesting topic. I think the problem here is, cart before the horse. I don't know that any significant style of composition evolved where there was any "common practice" using quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b> and thus no systematic usage was ever developed - so "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" is not really a thing.

What people often call quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b> in Jazz (especially) and in pop is really not, it's just quartal *voicings*.

I think what we might be missing is any systematic way of identifying quartal chords.

But they are more of an extension of tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> rather than a replacement for it, or completely new system - at least, any new system that had enough popularity where a describable common practice developed.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Assuming you're able to read music, have a look at Haydn's String Quartets - he's really the father of the genre. But you can also look at early Haydn Symphonies or even other earlier "Sinfonia".

Early on, many of these pieces have a pretty simple distribution - Violin1 takes the melody, Violin 2 and Viola take the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (inner voices) and Cello takes the bass.

But as they go on, you see a wonderful diversity in approaches. For example sometimes a melody is accompanied by just a single line (like 2 part counterpoint) and the Violins will take the melody together and the Cello and Viola will double the lower part (in 8ves a lot of times).

So variations are endless - I suggest the Haydn because it starts kind of simple (but like Vivaldi Concerti are also instructive). If you start with Mozart or Beethoven Quartets, they're already sort of highly virtuosic. So I think it will be easier to get some "starter ideas" and "jumping off points" from the earlier and simpler forms.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Let's see, traditionally, Minor keys had a tendency to "drift towards Major". That's basically the reason composers started using what we now call "Harmonic Minor" or at least used the "Leading Tone". Putting G# on the Dominant chords (E, G#o) in Am helps "orient" the music towards Am rather than the Relative Major (C).

So that's one historical strategy for maintaining an Am tonal center instead of having it drift towards C unintentionally.

There's nothing really wrong with a melody that, if you took it out of context, sounds like it's in the Major mode. After all, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> can "outweigh" the melody and basically "force" what is essentially a Major melody into a Minor context (your melody "in C" and your <b><u>harmony</u></b> "in Am").

However, musically-speaking, your melodies might be more effective if written from a "minor" standpoint.

A strategy for this is trying to conceive of the melody with the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or both simultaneously, etc. That way you're sort of already thinking "in minor" while coming up with the melody.

But I wouldn't worry too much if, in the future, you pull out a melody from a minor piece and realize that on its own it's major. That's not impossible. But again, you probably want to practice writing melodies that "sound minor" on their own.

Try pulling out the melodies to some pieces you know are in a minor key (even folk melodies, or simple Christmas Carols, etc.) and see how a minor melody works and what elements make it sound "more minorish" even without any <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Many melodies *imply* <b><u>harmony</u></b> without the actual <b><u>harmony</u></b> being there and that's something a lot of composers saw as an ideal to strive towards - sounds like that's something you want as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>See TheaOchiMati's post for a more accurate "map" of Functional Progressions.

You *could* apply similar thinking to "other modes" - but there's a little bit of a problem there - it's essentially putting a square peg in a round hole.

Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> developed in tandem with the Major/Minor KEY system.

Modal music existed prior to Tonal music and didn't use "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" as we know it.

Modern music using modes could certainly adopt the idea of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and apply it to modes. But as you have already seen, because of the raised 7th degree in minor, you get some additional possibilities.

To make a rough overview of Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, it focuses on "ascending progressions" which are the following:
1. Up a 4th.
2. Up a 2nd.
3. Down a 3rd.
Exception: When the leading tone is present, it may negate a possible progression (which is why we don't use V - iii very often, even though it's "down a 3rd").

So you very well could apply the same thinking to modes - but here's the problem:

If we used "natural minor", the leading tone would cause things to drift towards the relative major. So we had to introduce an "artificial leading tone" so to speak.

So if you applied these ideas in Dorian for example, you'd probably have to include an "artificial leading tone" in Dorian as well to "overcome" the natural tendency of the chords in Dorian to drift towards those in Ionian (which is exactly what pre-Tonal composers of early modal music did!).

This is why a lot of modern composers using modes don't use functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and find other ways of defining the center - because otherwise it may sound "too classical" which defeats the whole purpose of composing in a mode to begin with (unless you want that of course).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The chords you linked to are not fully accurate as I'm sure you know, but more insulting is this "G7M" business. I hope you're aware that it's GM7 or GMaj7 etc.

This piece is "in D" and calling it "in the key of D" might be appropriate, but the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is generally non-functional. Nothing wrong with that at all.

I'd see the FMaj7 as a "borrowed chord" - an example of "Mode Mixture" which is using chords from the parallel key - in this case chords from D MINOR are used in an otherwise D Major context. Nothing wrong with that either and quite common, especially in "hybridized tonality" that approaches "centric music" (which is not widely known or well-defined online, but is a common way to speak about music that still has a "pitch center" but eschews the other "trappings" of tonality).

C is also borrowed from the parallel mode (minor mode borrowings use the "natural minor" versions of chords)

Then yes, the whole thing just "changes key". It is a "modulation", but like so many post-tonal works, it is an "abrupt" modulation (called a Phrase or Direct Modulation usually) and just sort of "goes there" without any kind of transition. It "works" because we've heard this type of thing so many times in music already.

Furthermore, the juxtaposition of the DMaj7 and FMaj7 seems somewhat "key changey" in a way, and the cross-relation (or chromatic shift) between the C# and F# with C and F kind of set our ears up for these kinds of "sonic shifts" so none of it is too shocking to our ears. Once you hear it once, then you're like "hey, that sounds cool".

Yes, + chord at the top. Unfortunately, wrong transcriptions abound online. It drives me crazy when I see a guitar tutorial online that the person just used some wrong tabs they found online and didn't bother to "fact check" to see if they're even write and now go on as if it's the de facto version of the song - too many people are learning music "wrong" this way, and it's a real shame.

FWIW, I try to avoid "academic" analyses (I'm a college music professor who's taught theory) of popular music like this becuase I feel that trying to use concepts and terminology that were developed for Common Practice Period music on music from other styles ranges from uninformative to square peg in round hole.

This particular piece has enough elements present that we can use *some* ideas from CPP Theory to describe it, but IMHO our modern popular music really deserves its own set of terms and concepts, just like what we do with pre-tonal Renaissance and Medeival music.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You "heard"? A lot of people seem to be excited about it, because it seems like some great mystery, but plenty of music is still written that uses just plain old major and can be quite exciting/energetic - that usually has to do with how it's written, not what scalar resource you use!

That said, there are a couple of different versions of the term.

Mode Mixture (proper I guess) is when you use chords (and notes) from the Parallel mode. If you were in D Major, you might use chords from the Parallel D minor, such as F, Gm, C, etc.

Essentially, if you do this, the functions are usually the same as they'd be in Major.

For example, in D Major, you might use a Gm chord (which is "borrowed" from D minor) to lead to your V chord (A) in the exact same way you'd use it in Major (IV - V versus iv - V). 

Likewise, a ii-V-I in major could become iio-V-I - so the iio is borrowed from the minor mode.

It's not uncommon to use extensions that come from the minor mode in similar situations so it could be iio - V7b9 - I.

V9 is from Major while V7b9 is from minor.

It's actually kind of common for the viio7 to be "borrowed" all the time. In major keys it *should* be viim7b5 (vii half-diminished) that goes to I but very often people use the viio7 (fully diminished) instead. So they're already using mode mixture and don't know it.

Some people also use the word "Modal Interchange" which AFAIK is a term more associated with Jazz and from what I understand that unlike the "classical" Mode Mixture which involves just Major and Minor, Modal Interchange involves using elements from all the modes. So an F# in C Major would be "hinting at Lydian".

There's a lot of Mode Mixture (and modal interchange) in popular music that doesn't use functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, so unless you're specifically trying to copy the way Haydn or Mozart did it (or it actually becomes even more utilized with Beethoven and later Romantic Period composers) I'd say your best bet it to rip apart music where you actually hear these sounds and figure out how it works.

Rather than learn something because you heard you should, find a sound you like and figure out what it is!

That said, Mode Mixture is a topic a lot of people are unfamiliar with and it is important to learn, but the "theory" out of context isn't all that helpful. Find sounds that sound "energetic" or "exciting" to you, and figure out why!!!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>How *I* would describe it is "Tonic" and "Not Tonic".

You could describe it as a good example of Aeolian Mode, in contrast to traditional minor that uses raised 7 and a a Major dominant chord.

Sometimes the minor v is called a "minor dominant".

In some ways, it acts as if it's a dominant, but we may not want to use that word and we might not want to say it has a "dominant function". But if we hear B as the root, there may still be a "V-ness" to it.

So in a really broad way of thinking, it's "the other chord that's not the tonic" (or the "center" is maybe even better). It's "more aurally complex" or, if you like "dissonant" and while it may not have the same impetus to "resolve" in the same way that a traditional dominant would, it "assumes the role" of the dominant.

How many parallels you want to make with traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b> depends more on whether you're trying to point out the similarities or differences! It shares some typical Tonal ideas, but presents them in a somewhat more Modal and Centric context.

And man, I hate that song. Name the horse already.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hello.

Yes. It's art. You're allowed to do anything you want. You don't even have to play chords!

However, of course, if you want to make music that sounds like or emulates a specific style then it is helpful to learn what elements make up that style so you can use them as well.

If you are in C Major, the chords in the key are C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am and Bo (B diminished). There are also 7th chords and 9th chords etc. in the key.

You can use "Mode Mixture" or "Borrowed Chords" which are chords from the Parallel Mode (using chords from *C* Minor in *C* Major as in your example).

You can also use chords from "secondary" keys - usually a Secondary Dominant (also called an Applied Dominant).

But chords can also come from anywhere really, and ultimately it's based on what effect you're trying to create or what sounds good to you.

For example, very popular now, especially in your Hollywood style film scores - and often in Sci-Fi - are "Chromatic Mediants" which are defined as two chords whose roots are a 3rd apart and are of the same quality (i.e. both major or both minor).

C to Eb, C to E, C to Ab, or C to A would all be examples of Chromatic Mediants.

Both chords are from different keys, and while some of them may be examples of Mode Mixture, they're not always treated that way, and even though they come from a "secondary" key, they're not really used functionally like an applied dominant.

Kostka and Payne in "Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" called chords like this "Color Chords" which simply put where just chords that "added a color" (i.e. sounded good!) rather than any that had any other specific reason for being.

That would also include other chords that don't fit any of the above categories.

I would say, you're not only allowed to use these chords, but I'd encourage you to use them!

But I'd also encourage you to learn music through actual music - learning to play music - listen, play, analyze - rather than learn it "from theory". There is here to describe music, not necessarily prescribe what you do!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>A sledgehammer is useless for pulling out nails.

It's a tool. It has its uses, sometimes specific.

I agree with others that using "1 2 3" is just as good as "Do Re Mi".

However, half step "leading tones" take on the "eee" sound (Ti, Mi, Li, etc.) and half step "un-leading tones" (b6 in minor) take on the "ayyy" sound (le, te, etc. rhymes with lay).



The only exception is "Re" which is already pronounced that way.

So there's a logic to the syllables the numbers don't have.

Plus it's far easier to say "Ti" than "Raised Seven" or "Sharp Seven".

There are two types of solfege - moveable Do and fixed Do.

Moveable Do is actually far more useful for Tonal Music when "Do" becomes the Tonic.

Using numbers is like "simply naming" chords in a progression:

I - II - V may not tell you that "II" is "special".

But I - V/V - V has a different meaning - it shows that V/V is "special" and has a FUNCTION beyond it just being a "two" (note, some others do see "II" and comprehend that function though).

"Fi" not only "names the note" but it also tells you FUNCTION - it's acting as a leading tone to So, just like the accidental in a V/V (of course it could be a non-functional chromatic note as well).

So there's a lot more to the solfege syllables than most people ever understand, especially if they just slug through a sight-singing class without ever making the Tonality connection.

I did that myself and didn't realize until I got out of school how useful it could be. Sounds geeky, but I started practicing solfege while working in a warehouse and it really helped me "internalize" pitch relationships and HOW THEY RELATE TO THE TONIC.

Another thing - a lot of people learn intervals "out of context". This is bad IMHO (though again, as a tool it has certain uses).

On encounters say, a major 6th up far more commonly as So up to Mi (5 up to 3) than as Do to La (1 up to 6). So learning "A Major 6th" by 1 to 6 (which is how most people do it) or Do to La is actually not as useful as learning the sound of So up to Me (My Bonny...).

Understanding the Solfege syllables as *parts of <b><u>harmony</u></b>* - chord members is yet another way these are important (though that particular thing could be done with numbers as well).

Still, the "functional" aspect of the syllables gives them "more meaning" than "just naming notes" and until people understand that, it does seem a but superfluous.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"Goal-Oriented" (or Teleological) harmonic narratives is what "Functional Music" (or functional chord progressions, etc.) is!

Beethoven was not the only "culprit" in this. It begins with Tonality, and ends, well, it hasn't ended - people are still writing functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> today.

Cage wrote a piece that was silence. I think he's what we now call "shock art". His statement was made to cause a fuss, not to be accurate.

I will say, that it is fair to say that "The Romantic Behemoth" has attracted many composers to the point where Hans Zimmer and John Williams can make lots of money.

"The Romantic Behemoth" is my word for this sort of "haugty" music (self-important?) typical of post-Beethoven romanticism (maybe "overblown" is a good word) that evolves into Mahler and Berlioz (sorry fans) and continues today in "Epic" movie and video game music the kids are all so excited about.

IOW, Cage may have been lamenting that composers think they should be composing like Bach still (you can find many today who do) rather than "moving on".

So yes, a young person hears Beethoven's 5th for the first time, is moved, and decides to become a composer, and goes to work right away on their First Symphony, Opus 1.

I see this time and time again online.

So Cage may have been arguing young composers should be listening to contemporary music and having it progress forward rather than reliving the past or being "old-fashioned" and so on.

Of course, they're probably not going to learn too much from listening to 4'33"...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think you meant Pentatonic Scale.

You could just play this pattern on strings 5, 4, and 3 open, and you'd have the same notes.

Yes - a "chord" with some "wrong notes" in it could be identified as one thing on its own (like D5/A) but when it "morphs into" the "real" chord it "would have been had it not had the wrong note in it" in this case the "real" chord being Am - so yes, we'd often analyze that as just the destination chord with "non-chord tones" included until they finally resolve. Either way of thinking about it is fine, but I'd say if you're thinking of it "morphing" into the next chord, it might be better to think of them as at least a *similar* <b><u>harmony</u></b> rather than two distinct, unrelated chords.

Last bit - yes, if the chord "would have been" C-E-G-A - which is C6 (assuming a C root) then C-E-A - which is Am out of context, would sound more like C6 if you add the G back into the chord.

C6 and Am7/C are the same notes, but it depends on which you hear as the root.

One of the cool things about your progression is you could be tricky with it. If it were me, I'd play one set of bass notes (like centering it all on A) one time through, then a different set another time through just to mess with people ;-)

So you could sort of "force people to hear the root as C" by using the C bass note.

Or, you could add the G into the chord and make it that much more ambiguous if you wanted!

Just wanted to mention something about the Pentatonic Scale.

IMHO it's best to think of Pentatonic as a SUBSET of a Major or Minor scale (or possibly a mode, etc.).

I've never really seen A-C-D-E-G as a "separate" scale. To me it's just "A minor missing two notes" (or it could be C Major missing two notes). And it appears in music VERY FREQUENTLY like that.

So to me, if those are the 5 notes you're using, and your chords support A as the center, and maybe a bass line does too, I'm going to be thinking "Am" not "Pentatonic" for <b><u>harmony</u></b> choices. You absolute might want to restrict it to ONLY the Pentatonic notes, but very often you can still add back in the "missing notes" to no ill effect (and maybe even a cool effect) which is probably why I liked that F bass note (which is part of the KEY of Am).

It's just a different approach and I see that as yet another tool you can use to make music.

Best
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, a little advice.

Walk before you can run.

Many "composers" want to start out writing a "Symphony" or something.

Mozart didn't even start out writing a Symphony!

IOW, most of the famous composers (and musicians) we know of we know from their "mature" or "developed" works, not their "student" or even "beginner" works. But most concert pianists started with "Twinkle Twinkle" - they may have accelerated more quickly than the rest of us, but they still had to start somewhere!

It may be a little overly adventurous for you to try to tackle writing for Band when you don't even know how to write for a single instrument yet (that's an assumption I'm making, sorry if it's a wrong one, but I'm trying to make a point).

What instrument do you play? Maybe should start with a Duet for you and a friend to play on something like Trumpet and Clarinet, or something like a "Bugle Call" or "March Tune" for Trumpet and Drum.

Or if you can work at the Piano, maybe for your instrument with Piano accompaniment.

When you get into the whole band, you're talking about "orchestration" and "arranging" beyond the scope of the basic musical form you'd use for a piece for fewer players (typically).

Do you know the ranges of all the instruments? Do you know the transpositions?

One thing a lot of beginners do is "model" their piece on another known piece. Maybe you can find a waltz for band and use the "skeleton" of it, while filling in your own details as far as rhythm, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and melody choices. Have you studied the scores of great band arrangers?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'll just add to harpsichorddude's excellent summation, sometimes an analysis focusing on one primary element (such as Form, rather than <b><u>harmony</u></b> for example) can be more informative - or maybe point out a more interesting or unique facet of a work than what most "analysis" does - which is often simply "naming the chords".

IMHO, "naming the chords" is about as useful as naming the notes in many cases. Sometimes that's all a "harmonic analysis" is, but that can be very lacking when other, more important things are going on in the work.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I use the word "anti-functional" merely as a descriptor - not a specific accepted term!

But I do see a lot of music that seems to "intentionally avoid" functional progressions in favor of - oh dear, I guess "anti-functional" is a good word :-)

It's the rebellious nature of Rock (and Roll). It's "anti establishment", so should the <b><u>harmony</u></b> be!

So you see a lot of "backwards" progressions in rock, like V to IV, or V - IV - I and so on. Really they were more likely simply re-orderings of primary triads to give them a "fresh" sound, but I think in some cases players intentionally wanted to avoid sounding "too classical" or "too ordinary".

I'm not familiar with enough of them to be able to speak to your question though. When I think of the Doors songs I know, most of them have at least some non-functional progressions, down to something like Light My Fire, which is kind of all over the place! 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hmm. Good job. It seems a little "generated" though - it's almost like you understand how the voices interact in terms of rhythm and contrast, but it's like you don't understand <b><u>harmony</u></b> - at least of Bach.

m.2 would happen. That's called "doubling"

But m.1 would not. You wouldn't have the same note on beat like F# - A - F# in both parts. So why it seems "generated" - it looks like you just wrote the same thing in voice - F# - A - F# - doubling, just like you did in m.2, but you "filled in" an 8th note in between each note on the beat.

m.7 has the same kind of problem.

Your "most typical" measure is m. 28.

Take a look at it: You have what is basically a G <b><u>harmony</u></b> for the whole measure, and B against D, followed by B against G and D against G. The melody in the LH is stepwise "filling in" the space between the 2 B notes and the D note with non-chord notes.

This is the most typical way 2:1 ot "two against one" (sometimes called "2nd Species") counterpoint works.

You should visit this page because it can really help you understand the style - you are often using 2nd Species (any time you have 8th notes in 1 part and quarters in the other) so it could help to understand it better.

It would make this already good framework you have into a much more effective piece IMHO.

But this is really great start so congratulations!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ha ha. Well, you know, "spoken singing", Non-functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> - sometimes verging on atonal, or at least non tonal. poetry set to music - 10 note motif in PL not unlike looped-type beats in rap (small cell generates musical material, etc.)...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You make them rely on the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Define what you mean by "riff".

MOST music is "<b><u>harmony</u></b>-based" - even Bach's works for solo Recorder or something - which is nothing but melody - is still conforming to harmonic movements.

Early Gregorian Chant is only melody-based.

Counterpoint in general, while conforming more and more to <b><u>harmony</u></b> as <b><u>harmony</u></b> evolves, maintains a little more independence and relies more heavily on linearity as opposed to verticality (lines versus chords).

The same can be said of a lot of popular music - for example something like "Play That Funky Music (White Boy) by Wild Cherry uses a bunch of "streams" that are essentially riffs - there's the opening guitar riff, then the bass line (which is a riff I suppose) and then the chordal guitar comes in, and while it's chords, it's more like the chords are a "unit" that gets treated as a riff.

Lots of pieces like that.

"Whole Lotta Love" by Led Zeppelin is pretty much one riff for most of the song and essentially provides one static <b><u>harmony</u></b> (if you even hear it as that) so to say it's "chord-based" is more of a stretch.

Then there's Schoenberg...

I mean, really depends on what you mean by "riff" and in what context.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, an ostinato is a "repeating idea" so we could consider many drum beats, or bass lines, or repeating riffs to be ostinati.

I think you're oversimplifying the genres a bit. Most "Classical" music and early Jazz are certainly "about the melody" - it's why all lead sheets have the melody written out.

There is, if you like, a "melodic-harmonic complex" where melody is supported by and interacts with the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

And there are examples of pieces in both genres that are harmonically based.

I think the problem with Jazz is, a great deal of people seem to approach it as harmonically driven and place more emphasis on chords than what the song is actually about, but I digress.

I can't think of any specific genres that are exclusively riff-driven or even ostinato-driven or that are even "primarily" those elements.

Certainly a lot of guitar-focused music especially in metal and heavier forms - but even "blues rock" etc. - rely heavily on riffs. Sometimes, as in the Led Zep example, or other things like more prog stuff are "about" the riff, but the riff may certainly be harmonic or melodic in nature.

And there's a difference between a more ostinato riff like the Zep example where it repeats consistently within the song and songs that combine more riffs...

I mean you can go to Black Sabbath as sort of the progenitor of the heavy riff band if that's what you're looking for - they've influence a lot of modern metal directly and indirectly.

But to say Metal as a genre is primarily riff-driven might be a bit of an overstatement. Some songs are, some bands to it more, but there are plenty that are as much about chords and/ore melodies.

I suppose if you consider "Melodic Death Metal" it's own sub-category, then we can probably make up a genre that is "Riff-Based Metal" or whatever but I don't know if that really tells you all that much!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>They're not.
Inherently.

What you're missing is the "Historical Context".

There is a "style" of music called Tonality. Tonality, by definition, uses Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

In contrast, Modality (the kind that pre-dates Tonality), by definition, does not use Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, and that's one of the elements that makes it different.

Essentially, it was the use of Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> that "created" Tonality, and for a lengthy period of time, the way composers wrote using these methods was rather consistent, so we call this the "Common Practice Period" (CPP). The "tonal era" is the CPP.

CPP used KEYS rather than Modes. It is worth pointing out that many people do not make a distinction between "scale" and "key" but to fully understand Tonality it is important to make a distinction or at least understand the "KEY" is a concept above and beyond a simple collection of notes (i.e., a scale).

What Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is, is a hierarchy of chord functions that "lead to" the Tonal Center (tonic chord of the key).

This is so ingrained into the Tonal, Key-based system, that it really can't be used for other things.

However, certainly ideas and concepts from it can be used. And are.

For example, pre-Tonal Modal music (music of the Renaissance and before) uses Modes and doesn't use Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

But much post-Tonal "Modal" music simply replaces the Major and Minor scales with modes as pitch resources, but *treats them as if* they are key-based functional progressions.

So for example since a V-I cadence is part and parcel of Tonality and Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, post-Tonal modal music would often "co-opt" this progression and use a cadence, in Mixolydian, that went v - I.

That's not Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> per se, but the idea is clearly borrowed from it in the type of piece (based on context).

There could exist a "new type of functionality" for Modal music - music that has its own functions (just like pre-Tonal Modal music has it's own inner workings).

The problem is, there has been no consistent use.

And that's why we're so focused on "major minor" - because there was a CONSISTENT PRACTICE it's much easier to define and study. That's why it's shoved down our throats - with the unfortunate consequence that people do come away thinking the tonal system is somehow "special".

It's not. It's just one style among many.

In fact, we not only have a "tonality-centric" bias, we have a "major-centric" bias on top of that. Show 100 people a key signatur and ask them what key the piece is, and they will default to Major. Very few of them will say, "well, it could be one of two keys, either X Major or Y minor".

FWIW, "Ioanian" and "Aeolian" didn't even exist initially and weren't really recognized until Glareanus' "Dodecachordon" where 4 "new" modes were added to the 8 Ecclesiastical Modes (8+4 = 12 = dodeca- ). These were Ionian, Hypo-Ionian, Aeolian, and Hypo-Aeolian.

IOW, Glareanus was living in a "transitional" era where the 8 modes were becoming "neutered" (if you like) and all merging into a "fresh new sound" that would ultimately lead to Major and Minor, and functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

In some ways, Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is seen as a pinnacle of human achievement, and Tonality is also part of that. Our "greatest composers" composed in this style (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, et al).

And many people still make music in what is largely a tonal style - they may not use functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> but they may still use the Major/minor system (so in that case, the "scales" have been abstracted from the concept of "Tonality" and "Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" in yet another different way, that again could have it's own "new Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" but since we don't have enough of a consistent practice to identify and study, we have no names for these things yet).

A word of caution: Many people have, er, been, shall I say, led to believe, or have come to believe for whatever reasons, that the Tonal system is "special" in some way. They support these things with reverse-engineered psuedo science, flawed method, historical inaccuracy, and ignoring information that does not prove their point.

So when you ask "what's so powerful about the major/minor third..." (not sure if that's the word you meant though) you're going to get "well, the overtone series blah blah blah blah blah blah.

But there is nothing inherently better or superior about the tonal system. It's just a stop along the way in the evolution of musical styles. All that keeps it going now is people making music who haven't really studied music beyond the simple basics - and the simple basics we study are major/minor tonality becuase it's so well-defined and consistent, it's easier to teach and study. Thus there's this vicious cycle where you've got a young person on the internet going "hey, why is major/minor better" and then a bunch of people going "overtone series blah blah blah" and then they assume they read it online, so it must be true, and so many people believe it, it must be true, an "I heard..." it must be true, and so on. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Umm, all music. Especially pop music.

I mean, you're asking a loaded question. Your example definitely has <b><u>harmony</u></b> (chords).

And a LOT of music has repeating melodic lines - especially modern pop music that is "assembled" from often very short ideas (loops) that are repeated ad nauseum.

But again, most of them are going to have <b><u>harmony</u></b> as well.

Some of the minimalist stuff as mentioned - and I'll add Terry Riley and Steve Reich to that list, have repeated melodic bits that are not <b><u>harmony</u></b> in themselves. Look up Terry Riley's "In C" for a great example.

But that's nothing at all like the example you picked, and your example is simply just "pop music". The only genre it's part of might be "adult contemporary" or "soft pop" or the whole Lionel Ritchie school or something.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In chord-based music, especially tonal music and styles descended from it, I think it's far more important to know your scale degrees (or better yet, the chord members).

Singing intervals out of context is not all that useful. I remember everyone is like "a M6 down is "no body knows..."

I can't think that song, and given a starting pitch, sing down that interval. But I can think and sing from the 3rd of the scale (or chord) down to the 5th.

I mean, honestly, that's really the whole point of moveable do solfege. To place it in a tonal context. And it makes far more sense to me that way.

Now, when you start talking about atonal music, then yes, learning your intervals abstracted from any key or chord is the way that needs to work. "pure intervals" instead of their connections with other things.

"Waste of time" might be a little harsh, but on the flip side, how many of us are going to get into totally atonal music and need that kind of identification skill? It's a pretty niche thing. I'm not saying it wouldn't help you in tonal situations as well, but most of us are looking for something we can put into practical use.

So I'd say most people will want to focus on scale degrees/chord members and notes' relation to <b><u>harmony</u></b> and key rather than just as abstracted intervals out of any context.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No offense, but I see this as totally over complicating something musicians have been doing for a long time.

You can harmonize any scale. You don't need a lattice unless there's some specific thing you're looking for IMHO. Or, it's just another approach.

Simply put, we use, mostly, tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>. That means "third" ro in terms of chords, "every other letter". In C:

A-C-E = vi

B-D-F = viio

C-E-G = I

D-F-A = ii

E-G-B = iii

F-A-C = IV

G-B-D = V

That's it. In C Major, none of those have accidentals.

In C Dorian, that has Eb and Bb in the mode. So all you have to do is slap an Eb on any of the chords with an E in them, and a Bb on any of the chords with a B in them:


A-C-Eb = vio

Bb-D-F = bVII

C-Eb-G = i

D-F-A = ii

Eb-G-Bb = III (bIII if you prefer)

F-A-C = IV

G-Bb-D = v

You can harmonize any scale this way. Whole Tone:

C - D - E - F# - G# - A# (C)

Chords are C-E-G#; D-F#-A# - and so on - every other letter.

There are other forms of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, like secundal or quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b> where you harmonize scales in intervals other than 3rds (2nds or 4ths in those examples).

Some scales produce interesting results. Take the Pentatonic scale. You can harmonize as if it were tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> and take every other letter:

C-D-E-G-A = C-E-A; D-G-C; E-A-C; G-C-E, A-D-G - so it produces a mix of traditional triads and quartal harmonies.

But you can "invent" harmonization schemes like "next note skip a note" so your chords from a Pentatonic Scale could be C-D-G; D-E-A; E-G-C, and so on.

HTH and sorry if you already know all this.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are two ways these numbers are used:

1. Referentially - in reference to the Major Scale specifically

2. Generally - in terms of "scale degrees".

In C Major, Scale Degree 3 is an E. In C Minor, Scale Degree 3 is an Eb.

But, when speaking "referentially", "3" means specifically the 3 from the Major scale, and "b3" indicates that that 3 is lowered a half step (by whatever accidental necessary, not necessarily a flat). So C Minor has a "b3" in it - Eb. But in this system, if you're in C Major and you see "b3", it means Eb. If you're in C Minor and you see "b3" it STILL means Eb, not Ebb.

So that answers your first question, because when you say "1-3-5" then "1-b3-5" you're implying you're using the Referential system (these are my words, not official ones) and it's going to be C-E-G and C-Eb-G, or A-C#-E or A-C-E depending on the key, etc.

Your 2nd question seems to be using the "scale degree" system. So 1-3-5-6 in Harmonic Major will yield C-E-G-Ab. In essence, you're saying "what are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 6th scale degrees of this scale".

But specifically, if you're "in C" and you want to make that chord, you'd say 1-3-5-b6.

3rd question: Firstly, you need to learn scale spelling. It's C - Eb - F - G - Bb for C Minor Pentatonic (the F# could be either F# or Gb but many prefer "flat five" as a blue note as "sharp 4" means something else, and it's more consistent with the other flats in the key).

Most of the time, people do not use Pentatonic or Blues scales FOR <b><u>HARMONY</u></b>. They use them for melody (improvisation) only. So most people will use regular old Major/Minor/Modal chords, with Pentatonic notes above.

However, you can apply formulas like "every other note" to a Pentatonic and get various chords.

But for most purposes we consider the Pentatonic Scales to be SUBSETS of Major and Minor scales (or other modes).

C - Eb - F - Gb - G - Bb is 1 - b3 - 4 - b5 - 5 - b7.

We don't call the "second note" in a Pentatonic Scale "2" of any type. It's still the 3rd of "the scale it's a subset of".

I didn't watch the video but there's a lot of misinformation out there.

You CAN apply chord formulas to any scale, picking any combinations of notes you want. For example, 1-3-5 generically will produce the following:

C-Eb-G - in C Minor (1-b3-5)

C-E-G - in C Major (1-3-5)

C-Eb-Gb - in C Locrian (1-b3-b5)


and so on.

For other scales we don't necessarily use the same nomenclature.

Whole Tone Scale = C-D-E-F#-G#-A#

You could use "1-3-5" and get C-E-G#. There just is no "7" in this scale since it has only 6 notes.

However, many people still prefer to call the notes by their referential names, so the scale listed that way would be:

1 - 2 - 3 - b5 - b6 - b7 (and with a scale like this it's OK to use enharmonics so they could be b5, b6, b7, etc. as people are thinking "Bb is the b7 in C" because that's the context they usually use).

Simply put, there are a couple different naming conventions in use and you have to use context to figure out which is meant. But if you see "b" or "#" tacked on a note, it almost always means it's in reference to the Major Scale.




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Great example - a tour de force of compositional techniques. Snicker - you said "homophobic" by mistake ha ha.

I'm not sure though we're using the "homo-" terms similarly.

I consider the opening to be HomoRHYTHM. It's still Polyphony though. It's, if you like, a Homorhythmic Polyphonic section.

This in contrast to an "Imitative" or just "Contrapuntal" section.

After the the monophonic "trade off" section, you get a previously heard motive accompanied by what is essentially the rhythmic motive of the homorhythmic section. Again I wouldn't use "counter melody" to describe these as they're more like contrapuntal "subjects" and just "counterpoint" or "imitation" though there's no denying they're coming from already-heard ideas. But really more "Fugal" than anything (which implies polyphonic, imitative counterpoint!).

There's nothing here I'd call "Homophonic" (or homophobic ;-)  in terms of the classical definition of "melody with accompaniment". But we're very close to that in the "king of kings" sections.

I suppose the distinction is that with a "typical" Homophonic texture, your accompanying voices aren't necessarily very contrapuntal in and of themselves - the more coalesce into a "chord" rather than a "<b><u>harmony</u></b> implied with counterpoint".

Lot of grey area there of course but I'm thinking of something like an Aria - Rejoice Greatly for example - where the accompaniment is really a "unit" that's not necessarily contrapuntal itself (and let's say there's a spectrum there as well) and is really "subervient to" the melody.

Even though "king of kings" is long notes and stands out because of that, it's almost more like a typical long note fugue subject against a more active counterpoint than, say, Mozart's Piano Sonata in C (the one everyone's heard!).

But overall, yes, there are some wonderful examples here of linearity versus verticality, then, "dual linearity" as well.

As an interesting aside, when you hear most people sing the chorus, they sing the *moving* note melody, not the static upper voice! That's where this gets interesting because different things can pull our ears in different directions in different textures!


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hmm, I don't know that I figure out songs by scale degrees.

Speaking in general terms for pop songs, I find the chord progressions first, then work out any melodic bits if necessary (like solos).

But I sort of learn them separately, because I don't usually play them simultaneously - I play one or the other most of the time (as in rhythm guitar and lead guitar for example).

But in a Classical context, I would hear the F# as a non-chord tone  and once the D arrives consider it an Anticipation.

But with Jazz or other pop music that incorporates more melodic tones as chord tones, I'd conceptualize it as a chordal 6th and a common tone with the next chord, which I'd hear it as a chordal 3rd in.

But I don't really think of things in that way all the time - I might not even really think about what scale degree or even chord member it is until after the fact. I mean, if I have an F# in the melody with an A chord underneath, I'm pretty much thinking "F# in the melody over top an A chord". 

If I'm improvising, I know it's the 6th but sometimes I'm improvising over some chord progressions I know are all in one key and I don't necessarily pay attention to or even care about what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> underneath it is - because someone else plays it and because what I'm improvising isn't necessarily highly reliant on the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

So it's kind of not a way I think about it a lot of times, or if I do, it's kind of secondary to what I'm doing if that makes sense.

And that was a lot of buts wasn't it!

hth
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>What you're actually trying to avoid are common resolutions that lead to any chord that would make the piece sound tonal.

For example, in Dorian Mode, you don't want to focus on IV7 - VII progressions because those two chords are V7-I in normal old Major - and THE definition of Major Tonality if you like.

But actual Dorian Mode pieces from long ago will use V7 - i - just like minor, to *reinforce* the "modal tonic" of D rather than anything else.

Nowadays we'd use v - i (am to dm) because that "sounds more modal and less tonal" but there's no reason we can't use v7 (am7) or even v9 (am9) to resolve to i.

The am9 still has "tensions" on it, and the resolution "relaxes" - but it's "about" having a <b><u>harmony</u></b> with "more tension" in the form of upper dissonant notes (am chord plus G and B) that give it "a need to resolve" and when it moves to a "plainer" triad chord, the idea of resolution is there.

Bonus is, the Am9 contains the one note of Dorian that make it not Minor (Aeolian) - B instead of Bb.

So it's not really tensions so much as *chord progressions* - we want to avoid any chord progressions that sound "too tonal" or worse, that sound like a chord progression that would traditionally resolve to the Major or Minor keys that are relative to the Mode you want to use. 

If you do that, you sort of "de-modalize" your music!


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Depends. "Lead Sheets" are done with the intent of being "skeletal" - bare bones information for melody (head) and <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 

Since your example is a more traditional "sheet music" form of notation, one would expect to see a little more - and in fact there are some things that even "skeletal" lead sheets contain that yours does not.

Look at this from the point of view of another performer - what information do they need to have in order to perform your piece as you intended (or at least, as close as is typical owing to some of a performer's own interpretation).

You don't have a Tempo Indication - "Allegro", "Moderato", "quarter = 80" or things like that. It should have that, and if swung as in Jazz, should have that indication as well.

You don't have any dynamics.

You don't have any articulations (staccato, accents, etc.).

Those are basic elements that can add "life" to music, and keep it from being "one-dimensional". You may play it that way, but you're not indicating it that way to another performer.

You could have some phrase marks. I see "Chopin" in your handle - well, look at some Chopin music and see what you see. That's the stuff you need!

Likewise, you don't have any Pedal Markings. While some things are kind of "understood" based on the style (which can be true of phrasing as well) it's still nice to include them, especially if there's anything uncommon or non-traditional, but even just "with pedal" or even "pedal as typical" would be OK.

Fingerings aren't essential, but if there are tricky passages you've figured out a way to do comfortably, then adding them wouldn't be a bad thing.

There are a few "wrong" things you have if you want it to be like "standard" engraving.

Usually with chords, the ties go "outward from the middle of the chord" - so yours should have two up and two down, as opposed to 3 up 1 down.

Usually with key signature changes, there's a double bar. Often, they'll be placed at the end of a line as well if possible.

You might consider this - traditionally, if the key of a section has changed, and then it's to repeat back to a different key, you have a "cautionary" key sig at the end of the 1st ending's last measure. What you should probably have instead is just C Minor throughout that repeated section, and just write in the accidentals when it switches to C Major.

Here are a couple of examples:

http://bjungmann.privat.t-online.de/MusicXML/Gould_p_234.png

http://bjungmann.privat.t-online.de/MusicXML/KeyBeforeRepeat.png

By not changing to C Major, you actually eliminate the need for all these extra key sigs - it'll just be accidentals on the notes themselves.

With the DC - usually the "target" Coda sign appears where you have "to coda". It's ok to have both the target and "to coda" to reinforce but traditionally the sign is always present (in Lead Sheets they usually use terms, but in traditional notation they use only the symbols, or a combination of the symbols and terms most of the time).

There could be some other things (like additional double bars at sections) depending on your target performer.

So, how "in depth" you go depends on your purpose - if it's just a "memory aid" for you, then notes and meter is about all you need. But I'd say, for others to read, you should have at least dynamics and articulations. For "publisher quality", you should make it conform to standard practice.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, there are actually different ways of using Roman Numerals.

In academica, "case sensitive" RN are preferred (by those in the know anyway ;-) becuase it helps an instructor know if a student truly knows whether a chord is major or minor.

For example, in a Minor Key, using "I" and "IV" for those chords doesn't really tell an instructor if the student truly knows that the IV chord in a minor key is a minor triad!

Kostka and Payne's "Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" uses "case sensitive" RN, so, for example, the chords in a Major key are:

I - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - viio

and a minor key:

i - iio - III - iv - V - VI - viio

Aldwell and Schachter on the other hand use an "all uppercase" RM system, so C Major looks like:

I - II - III - IV - V - VI - VII

and minor looks like:

I - II - III - IV - V - VI - VII (note, in some of these systems, diminished chords are notated as IIo for example)

I think this is confusing, but the idea is that people should simply know that "3" in major is a minor triad, and "3" in minor is a Major triad.

When I was grading papers though, again with that system I can't tell if a student really knows that (and based on their test answers, it's good for me to know if they understand it or not!).

Now, sometimes even in the "case sensitive" system, when speaking generically of a chord, such as "the mediant" with no specified key, they'll just put a capital "III" and the reader should infer they just mean the chord on scale degree 3, which will be whatever it is in whichever key, major or minor.

But otherwise the "case sensitive" system is IMHO, "more informative" plus it reinforces visually - both good things to me.

In Jazz, people often use all uppercase but with "m" appended like they do for letter names for chords. So C Major looks like:

I - IIm - IIIm - IV - V - VIm - VIIo (or "dim").

Someone recently asked this here, and I find this one to be "overkill" and have actually never seen it before their post:

I - iim - iiim - IV - V - vim - viio - I find that a little redundant (and again, have never seen it outside that post).

Understand that the internet is the Devil :-) Seriously, so many people out there with very limited knowledge, education, training, etc. are now all "experts" and promote their information as such. This has cause even greater discontinuity between systems - many people out there are just plain wrong. But the abundance of misinformation (fake news...) makes it take on a life of its own, sometimes even becoming legit (I don't think we're quite there yet).

Basically, you have to look at the context the RN are being used in to determine which system they're using. Kind of a nightmare in some cases.

I should mention that while Salboo's assumption may be correct, in the "all uppercase" system what they do is show an alteration if a chord has been altered from its "in key" state - so a MINOR I in a major key would be I- (or Ib which is really bad).

IMHO, 

Im

or 

i

is far clearer (and more concise).


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Essentially, this is a "chromatic walkdown" (my word).

Often, there is a 4th chord included. Try playing:

E - Eb - D - C
G - Gb - F - E

over C and you'll hear a familiar "Country" or "Honky Tonk" or even the thing in "American Woman" by The Guess Who.

Replace the top line I have there with Bb - A - Ab - G and you'll have an extension of what you have.

It's also played ascending and is partly what "the Basie ending" is made up of.

If we "fill in" the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (for the one I gave first), a lot of times it's an A note (the 6th) which gives you:

C6 - Co7 - Dm7/C - C(6).

But if you move an inner part chromatically, you get parallel diminished triads (assume C in the bass still):

C7 - Co7 - Dm7b5/C - C

Your "G#" is an Ab really, and part of the Dm7b5 chord. However, assuming you only play the notes you have, it makes it just an Fm chord (Fm/C).

C - F# - A is F#o/C simply enough.

So yours is F#o/C - Fm/C - C

But begin your sequence with G-Bb on the top continuing down chromatically, or start with your bottom chord here and go up your list, all the way up to add G-Bb on the top.

You'll then have sort of a "complete" run which is also super common, and what you have (or the Basie ending) can be seen as "subsets" of (or at least, related to this entire idea).

How we analyze it is another matter. Classical theorists call progressions like this "linear" or "embellishing" progressions and so on. They really see it as one harmonic entity (A C chord) that is embellished chromatically and the "resulting" chords (like the Fm or Dm7b5, and the F#o(7)) aren't functional chords, just "connective tissue".

Others (especially Jazz players) may feel the need to go further than that.

IN such an analysis, the F#o(7) usually takes on the role of a "Common Tone Diminished 7" chord (cto7) which is really just actually a linear, chromatic embellishing chord, so all it really does is give it a more specific name.

It really depends on if you feel the "connective tissue" chords are important enough on their own to be given "chord status" or if they're really just "resultant" of the voice leading.

Just remember that extra note (the A-Ab-G line in yours) can either follow along chromatically with the other parts, or remain on the 6th (at least, those are the two most common ways to see it - they could be mixed as well).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's not at all "far outside the key".

In fact, in *traditional* minor key pieces the V (five) chord is ASSUMED TO BE MAJOR.

That is, in A minor, the V chord is E Major. Period! (ok, there are exceptions, but to drive home a point...)

This has nothing to do with modes by the way. This is plain old minor.

Now, word of caution - there are billions of people who don't understand how traditional minor keys work and are always shocked when they learn that in a Minor Key, some chords aren't "from the key".

Traditionally, V and viio are ALWAYS modified *when they are used as a dominant-function <b><u>harmony</u></b>*.

So The key of Am has E and G#o as the V and viio chords, as opposed to the "Natural Minor" versions of Em and G (v, and bVII).

That's not to say those "natural" chords can't be used, but they are typically reserved for special purposes and the V and viio are the "default" forms.

People relate this to "Harmonic Minor" but that's another can of worms but it is related.

Try playing:

Am - G - F - E(7) and you'll hear a familiar pattern.

If you've ever heard "Smooth" by Santana, it has a progresion like:

Am - F - E(7).

The E (E7) is not an "out of key" chord. It's part and parcel and in some ways, even expected as part of the key of A minor.

FWIW, the G# specifically in the bass is the note that is altered (Harmonic Minor) so that the <b><u>Harmony</u></b> becomes an E chord instead of an Em chord. This is to produce a "Leading Tone" like what the major key (A Major) would have to "lead to" the Tonic (Am) chord.

It being the lowest sounding note just makes it stick out and "lead up to" the A note when the pattern repeats (which I assume it does).

The jump down from a C note might be a little unusual but you'll find it all the time in "classical" works in Minor Keys - jumping down to the leading tone in the bass to rise up to the tonic note.

Essentially, you just need to play more music, especially classical music, in minor keys. But it does appear somewhat regularly in modern popular music as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes and no.

During the Romantic Period, there was a "dissolution of tonality" if you like.

Tonality was being stretched to the limits of its very definition with ultra-chromaticism, frequent, distant modulations, ambiguous harmonies, and so on. It was also incorporating more folk and non-European influences, including a "re-discovery" of Modes, as well as scales from other areas (Hungarian, Asian, etc. so we see more "synthetic" scales and whole tone music, etc.).

On some level, the dissonances are maybe inherently the same, but it's the way they're **treated** that is different.

At first, dissonances in the Romantic Period were still treated traditionally, where resolutions were pre-described.

As the Romantic Period progresses (and other styles like Nationalism and Impressionism, and ultimately Expressionism come to the fore) there is an "emancipation of dissonance" if you like, where initially resolutions are delayed, or transferred, and then ultimately abandoned altogether.

I think we see Jazz for the most part as "accepting" dissonances that don't necessarily need to be resolved (but to be clear, "classical" music had also evolved to that point at the same time if we're talking about the 1930s for example).

For example, in classical music, there's no such thing as a Tonic 6 or 7 chord. They're simply dissonances and can't be a tonic (not until very late for the 6, and by then the style is pretty much outside of its own definition).

Those chords would be dissonances that need to (must be) resolved.

But, in Jazz having a tonic 6 chord or in blues even a Dominant structure 7th is A-OK.

However, if you look at a classical 5ths progression like E7 - A7 - D7 - G7 - C it's nearly identical to Jazz practices.

And I think with Jazz, we can see a similar evolution as most early Jazz TMK doesn't have quite the degree of alterations (at least in the original version of a song), tritone subs, altered tension, higher tensions, and so on.

So there are a lot of similarities but I think we might be able to say that "unresolved dissonances" are more part of Jazz in general than in Romantic music in general- though of course it varies as each style unfolds.

I'm not sure what pieces you're thinking about specifically, but I would say that there is less similarity (on the surface) between Romantic Period music (in general) and Jazz than there is with very late Romantic - and transitional 20th century music.

Ravel and Gershwin hung out together. Ravel liked what he heard.

Debussy is seen as have harmonies that "pre-figure" Jazz harmonies in a lot of ways.

But I would consider them to be "20th Century" composer and post-Romantic Period composers.

Listen to Erik Satie's "Gymnopedies", Debussy's "Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun" and Ravel's "Pavane pour une infante défunte".

Earlier, and still "Romantic Period", I'd go from Chopin (primarily a piano composer, but his Etudes, Preludes, Nocturnes, etc.) to Liszt.

His "Nuage Gris" is often cited as a breakthrough piece in terms of "modernisitc" <b><u>harmony</u></b> that breaks with tonal tradition.

You might find it interesting:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=962lHSUXxI8

Another cornerstone work is Wagner's "Prelude to Tristan and Isolde".

Not sure if that's what you're looking for, but in terms of "unresolved dissonances", I'm sure these are ideas that ultimately influenced Jazz composers to experiment similarly.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yeah, there is no "one" book that's exhaustive on a subject or has the best approach.

In College, we used Kostka/Payne's "Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>", Samuel Adler's "Orchestration" (all this before there were audio file examples!) and some obscure counterpoint workbook, but it was based on Fux.

I bought Piston's books on my own just because I wanted different perspectives.

Honestly, I found Piston's books to be more "readable". There's definitely what I might call a "mid-century" style to them both in terms of language and presentation so they might be seen as "dry" or even "corny" nowadays.

But they're still full of useful information - none of which is wrong though in some cases he approaches some things like most at the time did not ("rootless" chords - which actually caught on in Jazz).

IIRC, when I bought them, they weren't horribly expensive (compared to other textbooks) so I bought them all over the course of a couple of weeks.

One thing I like about his Counterpoint text is he tends to focus more on "Classical use" instead of the whole Fux school which is more practical for people interested in that style.

FWIW, if you're interested in counterpoint, two of the best I've found are from Robert Gauldin called "A Practical Approach to 18th Century Counterpoint" (there's another one for 16th century style). He really addresses counterpoint practically - using real-world examples from real-world composers so you have models and forms to work from, rather than the "exercise approach" of the Fux school.

IOW, with Gauldin's approach, you're working towards making actual music (albeit stylistic of that time period) rather than just completing exercises that aren't the kind of music that most people want to write.

These come in paperback and aren't too expensive.

Gauldin also has a Theory/<b><u>Harmony</u></b> text - Structural Functions of Tonal Music or something of that ilk. Textbook level prices though.




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So I think maybe what you're missing is this:

The beat, or pulse, isn't something we really "hear".

It's **implied** by the sounds we hear. Sometimes those sounds agree with the beat, sometimes they don't. Sometimes composers like to screw with and intentionally make them not right - that's part of the fun of music - playing with the listener's expectation.

So while the bass is something you can pick out pretty easily, you're right, it's not consistent.

But what it's doing is playing 1 long note then 2 short notes that are each half as long as the time of the first note.

The way we might count something like this is "1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and".

The numbers are the beats, and the numbers and the "ands" are the divisions.

So the bass notes happen on ONE (and) TWO AND THREE (and) FOUR AND.

So just because no sound happens on the (and) part doesn't mean anything. Nor does the fact that sound does happen where I marked AND.

What it's doing is setting up a consistent pattern of Long Short Short Long Short Short.

This is called an "agogic" accent - the note is "accented" by virtue of it being longer. IOW, if we walked into a room with L-S-S-L-S-S notes playing and didn't hear the long first, our mind would still most likely orient to the Longer note being the "more important" (now there can be other factors at play as well).

Now go back and listen to the beginning particularly to the "guitar strumming" kind of sound - try to ignore the bass or turn it down so you don't notice it as much.

You should hear "one and two and three and four and". There is something in that pattern going low middle high middle (a harp like sound) that is also playing on those same values.

This is a "Tonic" accent - we tend to hear lowest or highest notes as being "more important" when part of a pattern like this. Again, the pattern that begins with a lower note then middle high middle tends to orient our ear to the lower note being the most important.

Now you might ask, well why not the high note? Good question - bring the bass back up and you'll notice now we have TWO musical elements coinciding to reinforce where the beginning of the pattern is - the agogic accent of the bass's long note, and the tonic accent of the harp-like instrument's arpeggio pattern.

OK, so now you might ask, "well couldn't this be Duple as well - I mean, it could be 2 measures of 2/4 instead of 1 measure of 4/4."

True.

So wee need to look for more clues.

"And NOW - now is on the beginning of a phrase ("and" is a pickup).

"NEAR" happens on a CHORD CHANGE - do you hear that?

So often, a chord change will happen every measure (no rule there, because it could happen every two measures, or twice a measure, and so on).

So if that's what we believe, we find evidence to support it. If "now" starts the phrase, and "near" ends it (poetically, it ends the first line of the verse - notice the semi-colon that seems to agree with the 4/4 premise.

So if we count "one and two and three and four and" you should hear a chord change every 4 beats. That's a pretty good indicator it's Quadruple Simple meter (simple because is beat is "# and" - two parts).

BTW did you catch "now, near" and "friend, face". The next verse has a bunch of C words in it...keep looking... ;-)

Now to be honest, I'm not sure what your professor means by "length" - it could mean "duration" which is note values, but that's kind of tied up into rhythm so I'm not sure if they're meaning length to mean something else (like phrase length, measure length, harmonic rhythm, form, etc.)

But most notes are between 8th notes (one and two and.. - the "strumming pattern" and harp arpeggio, and two shorter bass notes) and something around a half note in length for the vocal (and other instruments like strings when they come later).

But here's something important - remember the agogic accent I was talking about - check out "and NOW" - the and is short, and the now is long - so we hear the "now" as "on the beat" compared to the and (of course all the other musical elements support and confirm that).

But what's important about it is that not only is the sound of these instruments setting up a meter for us, the vocal melody is in fact strongly reinforcing it! So no funny business here - it's long at the beginning of the phrases and new measures (along with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> change).

A "perfect storm" of aural events if you will.

Notice that the vocal melody has a pickup feel ("and") then after the long note, the rest of the words are kind of crammed in at the end of the measure (like the first half of the measure is primarily one long note while the latter half is primarily 3 quicker notes - the last one acting like a pickup to the next measure - or all 3 of them do...).

I don't' know how much you have to do, but there are other sections in the song which do change things up a bit. But mostly, it's pretty consistent - IOW it's not drastically messing up our 4/4 feeling. There are a couple of Quarter Note Triplets that create a feeling of polyrhythm (3 against 4) but we don't always call it that (or syncopation) for such a short time.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The opening is Monophony. No <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I think that's pretty obvious so I don't think that's what you meant by missing 5ths and 3rds in some chords.

The 2nd part is in a style of writing called "Faburden" or "Faux Bourdon" and similar words where what you're hearing is basically parallel 1st inversion chords (at least, that's what we call them now).

Your bass line is harmonized with a 4th above and a 6th above and all the voices move together in the same direction (so if one part goes up a step, they all go up a step).

Sometimes this pattern is broken, mostly at the beginnings and endings of phrases, or at other structural points, or sometimes just for a variation in texture.

See here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauxbourdon

So this is kind of a common practice, but it's not something most of us are familiar with so it sounds a little strange (yet hauntingly beautiful ;-).

Thus partly it's your lack of familiarity with this style of composition, but you've also hit on another aspect of it which is, instead of being just parallel 8ves or 4ths/5ths like earlier Parallel Organum, or being counterpoint, or being various types of chords, it sticks more to this "1st inversion chord" format with the few exceptions to give a pretty "unusual to us" sound. And it's that parallelism and some "open" chords (no 3rd) that is a type of voice-leading that's unique.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There's a book - and I can't remember the name of it but it's something like "Modality in Bach" or something of that nature.

IOW, actually there were still "holdovers" from the Modal era still happening in the early Tonal era.

Though Bach took some modal hymn tunes and "tonalized" them, some of his Chorales for example are still somewhat modal (Phrygian especially). They've all be "tonalized" but there's this lingering bit of modality there.

There are some books that discuss the transition from modality to tonality, and here's a direct link to a paper that draws on another - the final paragraph is telling:

https://jeremiahgoyette.com/papers/tuoni.pdf

Essentially, the expansion of transposing modes (which gives rise to keys and key signatures as we know them) and the conflation of multiple modes into fewer versions (12 modes down to 2 transposable scales) are the two primary things that give rise to "keys" as we know them.

Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> arises TMK from a preference for "ascending progressions" over descending ones (these aren't what you think). I remember a paper where the distribution was counted and in modal music there seems to be no preference for one over the other, but as time goes on, there's more a preference for the ascending progressions (up a 2nd, up a 4th, and down a 3rd) that leads to functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> as we know it.

Haven't been able to locate that online again since the terms mean something more pedestrian usually.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes and no.

Yes in that, you can use more than one note to make a "chord" (or <b><u>harmony</u></b>) and you could stick to the notes of the scale ("diatonic" in that definition).

You can use "every other note" to make chords, and you could make 3-note chords:

C-E-A

D-G-C

E-A-D

G-C-E

A-D-G

But no in that there are no Tertian harmonies (every other letter as opposed to every other note) in what we'd consider root position like traditional heptatonic scales.

I should mention that people generally misunderstand the way the pentatonic Major and Minor scales are actually used in music: Traditionally, and often, they are merely a **subset** of the diatonic collective and usually used as a way to **restrict** note choice to just a specific set of notes.

A song like Amazing Grace, whose melody is largely Pentatonic, is almost always accompanied by standard diatonic <b><u>harmony</u></b> with tertian chords.

The same is true with most people who "use a pentatonic scale" to improvise. Almost always, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is made from the key (tertian chords) and it's just that the improviser plays a restricted set of notes we happen to call a "scale".

But really, it's a **subset** of the Key.

There are also BTW other Pentatonic scales besides the ones most people are familiar with (Major Pentatonic and its rotations) so depending on which scale you used, you might be able to produce more typical harmonies.

Furthermore, you could throw out any kind of systematic chord-building scheme and just use the notes in the scale to produce traditional tertian chords. So, for example, C-E-G is in C Major Pentatonic even though it's not "every other note".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Because "Classical" music (music of the Common Practice Period, or CPP) is NOT ABOUT SCALES.

It's called "Tonality" for a reason - it's about KEYS. The establishment of a Tonic through a hierarchy of tones and harmonies in functional progressions.

Key is a "concept", whereas scale (in the CPP) is more just simply a listing of notes.

For example, most people are taught Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor. You see posts daily here about "how do I write in Harmonic Minor" and all kinds of things.

But the vast majority of people don't understand how minor KEYS work.

To drive home a point, in this context, there is no such thing as a "Harmonic Minor Scale" or "Melodic Minor Scale". Composers didn't use scales to write music. They wrote in Keys.

There is a Minor Key. When composing in a minor key, composers would alter the 6th and 7th scale degrees for various reasons. For instance, they might alter the 7th scale degree by raising it a half step *for a **Harmonic** reason*. They might raise both 6 and 7, or not, *for a **Melodic** reason*.

All the HM and MM scales are are mnemonic devices to help use remember which notes are altered and under what circumstances.

Bach didn't sit down and go "I'm going to write in Melodic Minor today".

That's not how it works.

You write in Minor, and make adjustments accordingly.

I'd have to take your points one at a time to explain them all in very long posts, so I'm going to just say that there are historical and traditional reasons the way things are this way. If you learn about them, you'll get it. Otherwise, they seem random. 

But they're not. And there are reasons we maintain distinctions today.

Minor keys are not modes of a Major scale. That's modern thinking. And that's your problem - you're seeing these through what you've learned, which is not the full picture.

Maybe this might help:

We *sort of* do consider them "keys".

But "Key" is a concept beyond just a listing of notes.

"Mode" in the early music sense is also not just a "scale" but a concept. But it's different from Tonal music (Keys) so we want to spell out those distinctions by using different terminology for different concepts.

Likewise, a lot of post-Tonal music is in what is called a "Center" or is called "Centric Music". Here, a "center" is established through ways other than functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Most modern popular music is actual Centric rather than Tonal (but people can't seem to let Tonality go...)

If you use Hungarian Minor, and have a "center", you've got "Centric" music.

It works sort of like a key, but not exactly like a key, and we want to maintain the important distinction between Key-based music (Tonality) and mode-based music (Modality) and scale-based music (Centrality) even though that all have once shared concept - a "more important" tone or chord (The Final, The Tonic, The Center).

HTH

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>http://www.austinpattytheory.com/music-theory-2/centricity-and-atonality/

Direct link to PDF:

http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1064&amp;context=musicfacpub

I'm seeing more and more people use "pitch-centric" or "pitch-centricity" nowadays.

Essentially, both pre-Tonal Modal music and Tonal music are types of Centric music that both involve more specific yet different ways of establishing and maintaining a pitch center.

Much modern music is maybe more similar to modality but is also a hybrid of concepts from modality and tonality, with atonality thrown in - so I don't know of any specific "post-Tonal" or "neo-Tonal" like terms and it seems that "Centric" - while not all that common - is the only thing that really fits the bill.

Straus uses the term in his "Post Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" (or is it theory?) book but again it seems to be an unfortunate rarity in theory discussions and online information.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It is courteous to link to an example.

1. I am a music theorist. I analyze them as notes. That's about it. Yes, there is outlining of a tonic <b><u>harmony</u></b> in the key of G Major. But usually unaccompanied melodies without obvious harmonic progression are just generally considered melodies. In pop music charts you often see "N.C." for "no chord". There is no <b><u>harmony</u></b> really. There may be inferred <b><u>harmony</u></b> on your part, and it may have been intended to be implied by the composer, but really you should take it for what it is.
2. Most pianists don't analyze anything. They just play it. They're more concerned with the performance aspects than theory.
3. I remember hearing I lived in a democracy. There's a lot of evidence to the contrary though. Each teacher is not the bible. Performance practice varies. You could do scholarly research and find out what the typical intended execution is but otherwise it's all a "my teacher begat my teacher begat" each just passing along something they do which may or may not be historcially informed. That said, usually there's some "shaping" of the phrase and dynamics are one way of achieving that. But it's marked *piano* and *sweetly singing*. So that's what the Burgermeister wanted.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Depends.

Usually, no.

But it also can depend on the chords you use, and the "flavor" of the music.

For example, if you just used I and IV in D Major, you haven't played the 7th note of the scale in either of the chords.

So you can't really tell if it's D Major (Ionian) or D Mixolydian because the tell-tale note is missing from the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

BUT, if you play the C natural in the melody, we'd say the PIECE is D Mixolydian.

The other possibility is that we could have a "flavor" like Blues, where "blue notes" are common - namely the b3 and b7.

So you could actually play, let's say G Dorian over I, IV, and V "in G Major" and you'd have some bluesy sounding notes in the Bb and F from G Dorian.

Another possibility is playing a mode of a different root - for example, our G Dorian from above would work nicely over a C7 chord (because essentially, G Dorian is C Mixolydian).

Finally, some modes could "work" over a progression as long as there weren't direct clashes with notes. For example, you could easily play C Phrygian over a C Minor progression, as long as the Db doesn't appear against a Do chord for example.

However, again, context is key - Db in Cm could make a G7 chord sound like an Alt chord (b5) or even possibly a Tritone Substitution.

So it kind of depends on how they're used (bluesy, or jazzy, or like chromatic embellishments, etc.)

But if you've got a straight ahead Dorian progression like i - IV - i - bVII - i - IV - v - i or something, then playing anything other than Dorian of the same root over it is probably going to sound "wrong".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's not counterpoint in the strictest sense.

These are roots of chordal harmonies in a context where harmonic motion rather than melodic motion is more important.

I will say though that even in chordal contrapuntal textures, where the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is a result of melodic movement in the voices (i.e. contrapuntal textures), the bass voice is typically treated more freely than the other voices. Basically the independence of the bass ends up giving us more of what we considered root-based (and inversion-based) <b><u>harmony</u></b> which leads towards functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and a "chord progression" kind of texture as opposed to a more linear counterpoint-based texture (like a fugue for example).

IOW, "counterpoint" is a *compositional technique* that is adapted for various contexts and needs. Strictly following rules doesn't make music, just counterpoint. And in this case, you've latched on to one very particular rule that actually is far less of a concern than many of the other rules of counterpoint.

GENERALLY SPEAKING, the larger a leap, the more likely it is to be countered by movement in the opposite direction.

But going further than that tends to take you away from music and more towards regurgitation of grammar.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This a MELODY with "chord symbols" included.

This kind of notation (which is insanely common) tells you what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> would be IF ALL THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS WERE PLAYING!

But rather than write out their actual notes, people feel it's sufficient just to say what the chord is to give you an idea of what was played by the other parts.

This is actually also common for "Lead Sheets" in Jazz where the melody is given with chord symbols (the letters). This is done so players can improvise knowing what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> either was originally or is being suggested by the composer or arranger.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You know, you're probably right and good on your for calling me out on it.

So many people NOW "misinterpret" Harmonic and Melodic minor in the classical sense I have made the assumption that it's probably likely that the same thing happened with jazz players.

IOW, I'm thinking, someone saw it written down, and then used it without really seeing it as anything more than a collection of notes, and bam, there you have it.

But I would really be interested in where "Jazz Minor" come from or originates - for example, are the melodies of any Standards written using that scale?

Or is it a harmonization device? Or more related to chord-scale?

Would a minor key melody automatically be harmonized with i, IV, V?

I buy that minor key pieces used i6 (Cm6, etc.) but did they also use a major IV (F7)? Or was it mutable similar to Melodic Minor, but in different (or similar) ways?

Furthermore u/Jongtr brings up that the other "modes" or MM (or Jazz Minor if we like) but where/how did they originate?

I get that people see "Lydian Dominant" but are the melodies written in "Lydian Dominant" (standards)?

If it didn't come from pitch content of a melody or <b><u>harmony</u></b>, where does it originate? Or was it reverse-engineered like so many other theory concepts?


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Rameau calls a diminished triad "the chord of the small fifth" - at least that's the English translation of his Treatise on <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

They did not use Roman Numerals - they came later. The inversion symbols we use now also came later.

If you want to mention chords in a sentence now, you usually use the Roman Numeral and inversion symbols, ii, ii6, ii6/4 etc.

You can use letters, but "C6" is confusing because pop/jazz people think it means that chord, not a first inversion of a C triad.

So it's best not to mix RN with inversion symbols with letter names IMHO.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Good responses so far, but my 2 cents:

The "why" is simply a desire to create, and tradition.

You may have heard the phrase "art imitates life". A good example of this is a lot of the music heard after World Wars I and II - those were both devastating to Europe (and Japan). After the wars, you see a lot of angularity in art, stark contrast, and so on. Expressionism is partly a result. But so is to some degree, atonality and experimentalism. Listen to the "Quartet for the End of Time" or "Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshama for examples.

The Western tradition of <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody is **evolving**. Your use of the word "progress" comes off as a bit biased, but there are definitely a lot of people out there regurgitating the same stuff from 200 years ago now (as well as last month).

I don't know of any cultures that prefer minor keys - unless you call Heavy Metal (or Doom, etc.) a "culture". Only one culture developed the Major/Minor key system and there's a general preference for Major over Minor - though again, the "Romantic Behemoth" kind of makes people get all excited about minor.

3/4 is an interesting one - I blame it on the "unschooled" culture of beat makers. In fact, seems like most songs are 120 BPM. It's simply because you've got people who haven't learned anything about music cutting and pasting stuff into a grid and they don't even bother to change the time signature or tempo.

But there's a difference between pop music and other forms, so some of your statements seem a little like sweeping generalizations (and unfounded for other styles).


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm not sure why you think transcribing this piece and wanting a career in music are related. There are hundreds or thousands or more careers in music (or career professionals in music) where transcribing a piece from one instrument to another is not at all a high priority or in many cases even necessary (unless of course your career is as a transcriptionist!)

And I would bet that this piece has been transcribed (or arranged in this case, because it's been "simplfied") for piano a number of times.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERF_HPdCDog

If you want to make a simple arrangement, you need the melody, and enough notes to provide the correct <b><u>harmony</u></b>. That's pretty much it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JybbF3OYM6Y

As you can see, it's been done before.

Now, that doesn't mean you can't learn something from the process of doing this, but I want to throw out a caution here - the piece is extremely popular amongst "hobby musicians" - amateurs, wannabes, and so on - just like everyone wants to play Fur Elise. It can come of as a kind of "noob" thing.

What you should do instead is learn all the other versions you can find and then - if there's a gap somewhere where for example all versions are simply too easy or too hard, you can make a version that's right in the middle if you feel confident you can do so.

You may also want to transcribe dozens or hundreds of other pieces as well - but don't get stuck trying to transcribe/arrange this one piece for 3 years just to come out of it with a version that's been well covered by other versions.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are two types of Sus chords, Sus2 and Sus4

These can be built on anything really.

A Sus4 chord just replaces the 3rd of the chord with a note a step above the 3rd of the chord.

C-E-G would become C-F-G.

You can build a Sus4 chord on every note of a Major scale.

However, one thing to watch out for is that on some notes, like the 4th note of a Major scale, the suspended 4 will be a Half-Step below the 5th of the chord, as in F-B-C or B-E-F

I know of no specific names for these but we'd call it #4 (or #11) and b5 in most Jazz nomenclature.

Fsus#4 and B^o sus4 would be the closest analogs but might confuse readers in many contexts.

I should point out here that in Jazz, it's assumed that "sus" refers specifically to "Sus4" and if you see 'G7sus" it means "G7Sus4" which would be a G7 chord (G-B-D-F) whose 3rd is moved up a step (G-C-D-F).

Sus2 chords work the same way except that the 3rd is lowered one step, to a note a 2nd above the root.

C-E-G would become C-D-G.

Again, it's possible to build these on all the notes of the scale, but in two cases, on scale degree 3 and 7, the notes "aren't right" - E-F-B and B-C-F - so Esusb2 (which jass players might call addb9) and B^o susb2.

99% of the time, when people use sus chords, they're using either Sus2 that's specifically a whole step above the root, and Sus4, that's specifically a perfect 4th above the root. Then most of the time if no number is mentioned, they mean Sus4.

You can have both Sus2 and Sus4 on a chord:

C-D-F-G

You can also have "Add" 2 and 4 (which are considered distinct from 9 and 11 in this context) like

C-D-E-G

C-E-F-G

C-D-E-F-G

Not in these cases, the 3rd is always present (which makes these "add" instead of "sus").

Augmented chords aren't native to keys, though some explain them as being built on scale degree 3 of a harmonic minor scale.

But it's super rare that they're used that way.

Typically, Augmented triads are dominants (as are 7#5 chords in jazz) and function like them.

A typical use of an Augmented triad is as the V chord in a turnaround in blues and similar style - now it's kind of hokey in that use - but you hear it in The Beatles' "Oh Darling" and in another way in Chuck Berry's "No Particular Place to Go". 

In classical music, the use of the Augmented triad is primarily as an altered dominant chord, but it does appear on I and IV chords through chromatic passing tone motion.

Since the late 1800s, augmented chords have been used more freely and even entire works focus on them.

Sus4 and Sus2 chords are related to Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and were also explored more in the 20th century.

In rock and pop, sus2 and sus4 chords are extremely common (with added 7th less so) but augmented triads tend to get used rarely, more as an unusual sound. In fact, I'd say it's probably more common to find a 7#5 chord in jazz-influenced rock/pop than a plain augmented triad, which aside from the "hokey" use, don't pop up all that much.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It all has to do with historical evolution.

The 8 ecclesiastical modes (and later, 4 more) gradually started using a half step resolution to the Final (the Tonic in later music) in any modes that didn't already have one.

This meant that in Dorian, Aeolian, and Mixolydian, the 7th note was raised a half step. It was already that way in Ionian and Lydian.

In Phrygian, there was already a half-step DOWN to the Final.

I suppose, simply through taste and sheer outnumbering, the "ascending" ones won out (could be a "ascending to heaven" issue as well or just "rise" is better than "fall" mindset in society).

So it evolved that 2-1 (not b2-1) in combination with 7-1 (Leading Tone) became the "standard" resolution.

FWIW, in the modal era, the idea of a "V" chord was something that also was evolving over time - most resolutions looked more like a vii^o6  - I instead.

But, the shift towards CPP Tonality manifests itself in a number of ways, but primarily on settling in on this 2-1 and 7-1 in the context of a Dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b> that was essentially diatonic (no b2 in either the Major or Minor scale) but held over the tradition of raising 7 to become a Leading Tone in a mode (Minor) that didn't naturally have it.

The effect of a Phrygian cadence can still be heard throughout the CPP in the so-called "Phrygian Half Cadence" (iv^6 - V in minor) and the idea of the b6-5 resolution is something that becomes more and more prominent during the Romantic Period - so while not to 1, the idea of a half-step downward resolution - an "unleading tone" if you like, becomes more and more fashionable.

Finally, things like +6 chords start to appear on b2 (and Neapolitan chords appear here and there throughout the era) and more altered dominants begin the appear so we start to hear the b2-1 resolution more towards the end of the CPP.

But it may also be considered to be one of the things that begins to mark the end of the CPP, on unravel Tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

So the real answer is, tradition, and taste. At some people people dug it, then they got tired of it and used something else, then they got bored with that and tried something else, while simultaneously "re-discovering" things people used in the past, etc.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is part of the reason I feel the way most people learn intervals is a bad way. You know, the whole "this song starts with a Major 6th" kind of thinking.

I would say that you're even going further in the wrong direction by trying to attribute qualities to intervals. That might be fine out of context but in a musical context - as you've discovered - this can be totally useless.

IMHO, it's far more useful - at least to me - YMMV - to think in terms of scale degrees and chord members. Actually intervals are pretty useless to me in most contexts! I mean, I know what they are, but I don't "hear intervals".

Let me give you an example: I'm in a band, we're playing a song, there's a 3 part vocal <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I never say "you sing a 3rd above me, and you sing a 3rd above that" (except very generically).

Instead I say, "you're singing the 3rd of the chord and you're singing the 5th, I'll take the root".

I'm not really ever thinking about the distance between our voices or all the possible interval combinations.

Another example is thinking about scale degrees or Key notes - I might have a passage where I'm harmonizing in 3rds. Well I don't sit hear and go "this is a major 3rd, and this one's a minor 3rd" and so on. I think "I'm playing X scale starting a 3rd higher" and then just stay in the key.

To illustrate this different way of conceptualizing these, people commonly will use "My Bonnie" to give an Ascending Major 6th.

I don't think of it that way. I think of it as the 5th of the key (or tonic chord) going up to the 3rd of the key (or tonic chord).

It's not even a "sixth" to me. It's the 5th going up to the 3rd - sure, I know that's a sixth, but I don't really care about that aspect of it.

To bring this point home, a Major 6th from Do to La and Re to Ti are different yet again - I'm almost always going to conceptualize of them as being the 5th and 3rd of the IV and V chords (unless there's reason not to, such as a melody that truly starts from Do to La).

A good one is the tritone - try singing a tritone down, from F to B. It's not easy. But if you conceptualize them as the 4th and 7th of the key, it's easier. It's even easier if you have them in the context of a V7 chord.

But La to Me or Le to Re? Useless. It would be fine if I were doing a lot of atonal intervallic-based music, but I'm not (that's why YMMV again).

Screw the happy and sad stuff.

Learn how to use them in a practical manner and it'll be much more useful to you.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Why not actually learn some pop music?

the melody of "I am The Walrus" is practically monotone for the verses. Compare this with "I Will" both by The Beatles.

I mean we could go crazy but you'd be using clichés rather than actually understanding the music.

And what do you mean by "pop"? To some, "pop" is "Pops" music - Movie Soundtracks as opposed to Concert Music. Or do you mean Taylor Swift?

There are also fads - right now the whole EDM influenced filter sweep absolutely must be in every single song - Taylor Swift's first song from last night's Saturday Night Live proves this!!!

But if it was 1962, you might want something that sounds "surf/spy/spaghetti" and if it's 1969, heavy distorted guitars and psychedlia. 70s disco, 80s new wave, 90s grunge - not to mention all the country music and "urban" music that happened through those time periods as well

And I will say, a "pop" composer like Burt Bacharach might come up with the melody in tandem with the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but most pop people now absolutely write chord progressions and "melodize the <b><u>harmony</u></b>" rather than harmonizing the melody. Different tools, different results.

I suppose my best advice is, listen to The Beatles. They were, for the most part, a very melody-based band with a lot of tradition there, and it's easier to find information on them because they were so uber popular that much has been kept and much has been discussed and analyzed.

But suppose I came to you and said "hey, I'm a pop person and I'm going to start writing Classical music, what rules do I have to follow"?

Unless you are already intimately acquainted with popular music, it's either going to come off as a pastiche, parody, assemblage of clichés, or like some kid who hears a Beethoven Symphony and decides to become a composer and writes a piece with Alberti Bass and a Melody with no other inkling of things that are part of the style.



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Are you doing this in school, or just on your own?

Are you using Fixed Do or Moveable Do, or some other system?

I absolutely think it should be learned functionally first then expand, just like we do with tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> then moving into atonality. Or, maybe I should say, for me, personally, it all "clicked" when I approached it that way - again, as something I could use.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>VI and II aren't unsusual at all, and that may be your problem - you're not familiar enough with them, or their sound, or comprehending that they're not all that uncommon, or something along those lines.

Play the progressions I - vi - IV - V  and I - vi - ii - V - then do the same putting the I at the end. You can do the same in minor (ii is diminished remember).

I learned that VI (and III) were "variable" function from the old Kostka/Payne Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> books (much older editions now).

For example, VI is usually a "mediant" function, but it can "pretend to be" a Tonic in the case of a Deceptive Cadence. That's why it's "variable".

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I can't wait to hear other responses.

I've actually never really heard the term used specifically to refer to counterpoint like that - or if I have I just kind of didn't think that much about it.

After all, counterpoint is essentially linear.

I would say that the combination of lines (linear elements) certainly varies from those which are strongly intertwined with vertical relationships (<b><u>harmony</u></b> - like a Chorale style) to those that have lessening and little to no dependence on vertical structures.

Even with some traditional counterpoint you'll find "simultaneities" of harmonies that aren't really any real or traditional chord (of the time) and it's pretty clear that the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is simply a result (incidental) of the linear interaction. And even many otherwise tonal fugues have instances or even short passages where it's pretty clear the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - while "sounding OK" was simply a result of linear interaction.

I'd also hesitate to say that some composers "didn't care" about the resultant <b><u>harmony</u></b> - it's just that that <b><u>harmony</u></b> is dissonant, or "doesn't sound good" by traditional definitions. But the kinds of harmonic world they were writing in may have still had some influence on linear choice etc.

I guess, if it were 10 years ago, I'd call it "Extreme Counterpoint"!

Maybe we should call it "bi-melody" or "poly-melody" in the same way we do chords and keys - after all, I feel that the definition of "counterpoint" implies a balance between independence and dependence - certainly if the linear aspect disappears we don't call it counterpoint anymore, so why should we continue to call it counterpoint once the vertical aspect completely disappears. Though I'd grant that we'd have to first understand the harmonic context, and also if it were clearly an expansion of a known technique, the reference might still be valid.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In pop music like this, I just consider them a "nod" to another key - referencing the other key - maybe an extended tonicization, but I like works like "hinting at" or "pointing to" another key in pop music.

I also don't see any need to invoke modal justification when not really necessary.

IOW, it's a pop song. It's all overthinking it.

He's in C. The Ab chord is bVI and becomes V of Db, so after that part it's just "pointing to Db" to me. The chords are diatonic to Db. No modes. C Major, then Db Major, repeat.

Here would be an interesting experiment if you have time - forget the chords, and figure out what the melody notes (as well as additional notes in other instruments and the Bass). That will reinforce what key those sections are in. If the melody agrees with the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, there you go.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;For my not so experienced ears: With a C in the bass the first chord seems to have a more "fixed" tonality to it, while without it has a more ambiguous/funky sound.

I'd agree. For one, we're used to Tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> - building chords in 3rds.

Now one reason Quartal Voicings don't sound crazy bad is becuase they are often just re-orderings of Tertian chords, so there's a connection there.

There's also maybe the argument of the "acoustic root" which chords with a 5th (two stacked 3rds) in them tend to "orient" themselves to a "root position" in our ears.

So with C6/9 - over the C, you get C-E-G in the chord and that strong tertian chord with the 5th over the bass note orients you towards C being the Root (rather than, for example, A-C-E which is also in the chord).

This goes back to the whole C6 versus Am7 dichotomy.

But yeah, without that C note, the 4ths are a little more ambiguous as to what the acoustic root could be - that's why another poster was talking about things like F7sus4 because it could be heard as that in a different context.

For an experiment, try voicing the same notes in 5ths and see what happens.

&gt;Would that be the difference between a tertian chord in quartal voicing (C bass) and a quartal chord?

Well, in a lot of jazz, and especially online, and even more especially amongst guitarists, people often say they're using "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" where they're really just taking an otherwise tertian chord and voicing it in 4ths. They also tend to be found in a setting where other instruments are still playing tertian chords (maybe a parallel is a Pentatonic Melody over a triadic scale accompaniment where the accompaniment is not pentatonic).

IMHO - or, at least as I'm making the distinction here, while "true" Quartal Chords might appear in Jazz and other styles, but they're more a part of 20th century "classical" <b><u>harmony</u></b> where they are the predominant (or exclusive) harmonic element, and many to all harmonies in the piece are built from stacking perfect 4ths. So you'll see C-F-Bb, then F-Bb-C, and Bb-C-F as "inversions" of the same quartal chord, as opposed to things just "stacked in 4ths".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The bass pattern in the sheet music which sounds to be accurate for the song is called "alternating bass".

This is a very very common accompaniment figure where the bass part (or bass player) alternates between the Root and the 5th of the chord - often with the 5th sounding lower than the root.

However, we don't analyze this like 

Root - 2nd - Root - 2nd - Root - 2nd - etc. as far as inversions go.

We just call it what the "main" bass note of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is, or maybe would be if the bass wasn't doing this pattern.

So it's all just root position.

And yes, the "primary" note we figure our inversions from in cases like these are notes that are "stronger" or "more prevalent" or something - so in this case, yes, the F notes (the root) are on the beats and the C notes are on the off beats.

In some cases, you'll hear this same pattern in quarter notes but beats 1 and 3 are strong than beats 2 and 4, so the F note would still be "stronger" or "more important" because of that.

Very often it's whatever is on beat 1, but every once in while you get an exception to that.

The same thing happens in "oom pah pah" waltzes, a lot of latin bass lines, many arpeggiated bass lines, as well as things like Alberti Bass - it would drive you crazy in some of them notating all of the inversions, and really they're just "decorations" of the chord not a foundational bass note.

The article here contains some good references to pieces or sections of pieces

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartal_and_quintal_<b><u>harmony</u></b>

some, like Debussy's 3rd Etude "in fourths" or Bartok's:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4T3OcC51hk are more like study pieces and experiments with it, but you get the idea.

I've heard a lot of contemporary Brass group stuff use more - seems they like the 4ths and 2nds and work well for those ensembles.

The Ravel example on the Wiki page is pretty typical of that kind of writing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This explains it pretty well:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq8I1tzau_o

And for comparison:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju2wR76JKBg

That example is kind of a longish piece so it's a little harder to see the form simply, but it lays it out for you.

Just by convention, Binary is AB or ||:A:||:B:|| (that is, A and A repeated, then B and B repeated - or AABB).

What's important about Ternary Form is that the A material returns completely (or slightly varied, etc.)

There is super common form called "Rounded Binary" but a different name would be clearer (if we knew what the words mean!) called "Incipient Ternary" which means "becoming" or "approaching" Ternary.

Like Ternary forms, Rounded Binary has a return of the A material, but, it's not a *complete* return, only a partial one, and usually the latter half of the first A section. It is diagrammed as:

A B 1/2A

Additionally, it often appears in a bipartite repeat pattern, meaning from a music content standpoint it's Ternary (ABA) but from a repeat standpoint, it's Binary (AB) so what you usually see is called a "Two Reprise" format, meaning the two "halves" are each repeated:

||:A:||: B 1/2A :||

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7THnue1Knc

One thing to watch out for - I noticed a lot of videos are wrong in that they call things Ternary when actually they're Rounded Binary.

Here is a much shorter Ternary. Notice that the first section is 8 measures, then you see a double barline, which is where the B section starts, and then the A section returns (all 8 measures). So it's 24 measures as you'd expect.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YanVvm48R7M

This one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1gGxpitLO8

Is Binary. The first page is the A section which is repeated, and the second page is the B section, which is also repeated. Then that's the end, the A material never comes back.

Don't be fooled by the fact the A section has two phrases which are basically the same - that's not a "repeat of a section", that's the "conclusion of a phrase. We determine that by <b><u>harmony</u></b> in this case becuase the first half of the A section ends on a V chord (Half Cadence or what some refer to as a Half Close) and the 2nd half of the A section ends on a I chord (a Full Close or Authentic Cadence). But that "question and answer" layout of 16 measures makes up the whole A section on the first page, which is then all repeated. Then we get new musical material - the B section, on the 2nd page which is another 16 measure repeated (and it's in 2 phrases as well).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Schenkerian Analysis:

All (common practice) music can be reduced to:

3 - 2 - 1
1 - 5 - 1

Ta da.

OK, I'm being silly. But Schenkerian Analysis is in some part about the "stripping away" of "surface elements" to get to the "underlying framework".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_structure

(though Schenker himself saw it as a building up from the structure - so generative rather than reductive).

If you think about a building, you've got the frame - the skeleton it stands on - then if you see a fancy decoration on the facade, that's just for aesthetic purposes. Likewise, you can use the same basic skeleton to build a lot of buildings - the same "structural" principle applies to music - there as basic skeletal ideas that are then "fleshed out" to end up with music that has a common origin, yet can be unique pieces.

When we start with a full piece, we have to "strip away" the embellishments to get to the basic structure - and this is kind of like peeling the layers off an onion - or to make a further skeletal analogy, a person - you know, you take off the hair, you can't tell the brunettes from redheads. You remove the skin, you can't tell the dark-skinned people from the light-skinned people, you pull off the muscle tissue, you can't tell men from women (at least untrained people who aren't anthropologists can't) and so on.

At some point, we get to where it's all kind of like, we all have the same basic skeleton (or pushing it futher, a fertilzed ovum with similar DNA - which is what the "Ursatz" is sort of like - the "DNA of CPP Music").

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>*In a Common Practice Period Context:*

Your first example has the doubled B, which really is something you're not going to see happening in music where you're talking about functional versus non-functional 7ths.

The 2nd example (where the B is not doubled) is still not much better since the <b><u>harmony</u></b> doesn't change.

Functional 7ths typically (i.e. almost always for introductory pedagogical purposes) resolve down by step to the 3rd or possibly the 5th of the **next chord**. In rarer cases they might resolve to the root (more of a Renaissance move). Their resolution might be delayed through embellishments and suspensions and the like, or they might be transferred to another voice. But they're going down a step into the next chord.

So if you look at that B, in a C Chord - it doesn't resolve down to A, nor does the <b><u>harmony</u></b> change. It **must** be a non-chord tone rather than a functional 7th.

It is an unaccented appoggiatura (which is rare in itself but not impossible). But it's really an outlier of an example (as appoggiature are generally assumed to be a form of accented NCT/dissonance). Sometimes these are called "Incomplete Neighbor Tones" as well. Some call them Incomplete Neighbors when unaccented and Appogiatura when accented. The terms vary from broader to more specific for this NCT but if you can imagine the high E dropping to C first, then going on to B, then back to C in the next chord, you can see how it's an "Incomplete Neighbor".

*In a Jazz context:*

It's a chord tone.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Opinions aren't fact ;-)

And sorry I didn't mean to imply you were unqualified - after I posted I remembered some half-truths I conveyed to my students when I was first starting out! And you're right to seek out help - maybe next time just ask what it is without saying you're teaching it ;-)

Good news on those students trudging ahead!

Kostka/Payne's Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> has (or had) a good section on Non-Chord Tones that really stretched the definitions - They had two sections on Non-Chord Tones - sort of the basic ones then the advanced ones, then this bit on some that were really hard to define. Could be very informative.

I remember a specific example of a Haydn piece where they went into this very subject of "non-chordal 7ths" - I can't remember if it was an exercise in the workbook or in the text itself but it really drove home the point as I recall.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'd say, in answer to your post title, not all that useful. I mean, sure, you can find some patterns, or licks, or common ideas, etc. but let's put it this way:

There was a guy on a guitar forum who posted and said he had learned all of these Yngwie (influential shred guitarist from back in the 80s) solos/licks/runs note for note but when he tried to use them in improvisation they didn't sound right.

Well he was trying to take something he learned in Em and play it over Dm or something. Or, he was playing the Em lick over a G chord and it sounded "too major" to him or something.

IOW, most "solo" material is conceived of - even on the spot in improvisation (which usually consists of pre-learned ideas anyway) - with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> in mind.

Some licks are "interchangeable" but others are not.

And let's say the more melodic, and the less "riffy" a solo is, the more likely it's going to follow the changes (in Jazz especially). Furthermore, some improv is **dependent** on the changes - the players who recorded those solos knew the changes at the time.

So I'd say it's super important to understand the solo notes *in the harmonic context they appear*. That doesn't mean they can't be lifted and moved around, but in some cases the context is really important.

I've heard great jazz players improvise unaccompanied (on a solo instrument like sax) and you can hear the changes - the outline the chords with their notes. So solos like that are so intertwined with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> the two are one - so even accompanied solos can be that heavily intertwined and it's worth it to understand that context.

Here's a kind of funny parallel - a lot of people study Bach Chorales. Sometimes they come across a really odd chord and try to come up with some goofy theoretical justification for it.

Well, Chorales have words. Lyrics. And the word at that point was "death".

So without taking the lyrics into account, you're not getting the whole picture, and in that example, the more obvious reason behind a musical element.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Excellent post.

I will add about "mixing" - People do often *treat* modes *as if* they were functional. This doesn't necessarily make them functional though.

For example, out traditional Cadence is V(7) - I.

Well, in Mixolydian, you'd have v(7) - I.

We can thus treat it like an *analog* to functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> - it's not, but it uses a similar chord progression and concept in a similar way.

So you can certainly apply concepts from one into the other, but it's either non-functional, or it's own kind of new functionality (substitutional functionality?) that is "inspired by", but not the same as traditional functions.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I often say the same thing u/Jongtr did. In my case partially to raise eyebrows and incite thought (and discussion) on the subject.

Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor are really "oversimplified" ways of presenting a more complex subject, which is how scale degrees 6 and 7 are treated in Minor Keys.

Unfortunately, they are taught often *merely* as "scales" to learn and play.

The unfortunate result is that many think they are scales you make music with. Now, one interesting thing that has happened is that because of this misinterpretation, music has actually been written using these collections of notes "as scales" and thus as independent resources for making music (one interesting aspect is that when this approach is used, Melodic Minor is used *only* in its ascending form, both ascending and descending, which points to the dissociation between the two concepts).

IMnotsohumbleO, Minor should be understood - at least for traditional CPP style music and a lot of styles descended from it - as a "system" where the notes of the Key are there, and two of those notes, 6, and 7, may be altered for various reasons. 7 is typically altered for a **harmonic** purpose - to change a non-Dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b> into a Dominant Functioning <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 6 (and in tandem with 7 typically) is altered for a **melodic** reason - to prevent the awkward +2 interval in melodic passages (in some cases because the 7 raised for a harmonic reason necessitates it).

Someone distilled these into these rather simplistic concepts of "Harmonic Minor Scale" and "Melodic Minor Scale" for pedagogical purposes (probably as much for piano fingering or something as opposed to conceptual purposes, which is why those purposes got lost).

So I like to often present them as mere mnemonic devices - a listing of the alterations of "natural" minor to show which notes are altered and what they'll be altered to (and in the case of MM, a little bit of context as well).

Or, another way is to consider Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor "subsets" of Natural Minor, rather than two independently functioning scales.

Again though as I said, they have been "misinterpreted" (if we like) to be stand-alone scales and people have absolutely used them that way in music. In fact I actually prefer the term "Jazz Minor" for what is MM in the ascending form only - because (pedantically) it's not really MM - it's its own independent scale that simply resembles the ascending listing of MM.

So I guess realistically, we should always qualify the style we're talking about, but at the same time I think many feel we need to educate about the traditional use of **notes** in minor **keys** so people see where these "listings" we call scales come from.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are some "chords" that aren't *really* chords. Yes, we call them chords, but they're not really standalone, independent chords.

Many of these begin as simply Non-Chord Tones, but eventually end up happening simultaneously, later, without resolving and so on.

Here's a great example: Many books tell you to put parentheses around the IV chord in the following progression:

I - (IV6/4) - I

Why? Because it's not really a chord at all.

It's really just two simultaneous Neighbor Tones that happen to spell a chord. But it's an "embellishment", and it's not really functional (or a functional progression per se) and it's a 6/4 chord, which is a whole class of chords that "aren't really chords".

Now, think about this for a second. Suppose I did this:

G - G# - G
E - E# - E
C - C - C

Now we'd never spell it that way, but doesn't it look like I - iv6/4 - I?

They're just the upper two notes of the C triad moving up and back a half step. It makes something that looks like a minor iv chord, but, is it?

Now let's play around with that idea:

G - F# - G
E - D# - E
C - C - C

This time, I lowered the notes chromatically and returned.

What does it spell?

Well, some people might say D#o7 without the 5th.

But, it's a "common tone diminished 7th without the 7th".

E - D# - E
G - F# - G
C - C - C

What's this? Same thing.

Really, they are "just" Lower Chromatic Neighbor Tones (and if unresolved or unapproached, they're some kind of incomplete neighbor, or appoggiatura, etc.)

So is it a "chord"? Is it a mis-spelled Co?

We have this "chord mentality" where we seem to have to name everything as chords (I blame Jazz players :-D )

Seriously, it's like "what chord is this".

Well, it could just be a collection of non-chord tones happening simultaneously. And, it could even spell out a traditional chord (sometimes spelled enharmonically).

I suppose the question becomes, does it deserve "chord status" or a "chord name".

Kostka/Payne took an interesting approach to chords like this and gave them "names" rather than numbers.

So their whole thing about "Ger+6" and "cto7" are that they are "Simultaneities" rather than chords. Some other authors call them "voice-leading chords" becuase they are *resultant* of voice-leading (i.e. some combination of non-chord tones) rather than a stand-alone <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

IOW, not every collection of notes is a "chord" proper (though in other contexts, of course they can be, I'm talking CPP here where you'd be using a cto7).

However, you justify it by saying "that's the sound I wanted" not "is this a known chord or not - can I stick a label on it?"

Music would have never advanced if composers sat around worrying about if a chord has a name or not! In fact, even music with named chords probably wouldn't have been written if composers were worrying about what their names were, of, "is this OK?"  If it sounds good, it is good. That's all the justification you need.

So I'd say, yes, a o triad can work very much like a cto7. What do we call it? Who cares, as long as it sounds appropriate in the piece.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>1. This is something I've seen frequently over the decades: People think "theory" means the same thing as it does in the sciences. Honestly, it's a stupid name for it. The key thing to accept is that "Music Theory" is not a scientific method - art is not science.

2. There are scientific elements in **sound**, described in the field of Acoustics. But:

3. Composers make decisions based on conditioning. It's absolutely cultural. Maybe, at best, we can say that there seems to be an inherent need for humankind to express themselves by making sound. I'm sure some Freudians would trace it back to mating rituals - after all, Raves serve the same purpose as Waltzes did in the Victorian era, and Minuets did long time ago. So that is all tied in with Social Psychology.

4. No offense, but this is a common misconception among people who don't study a lot of music history. Firstly, Western Europeans made music for a very long time without having "chord progressions" and people were perfectly happy with it. Then, as <b><u>harmony</u></b> developed, it developed first more linearly rather than vertically. It really wasn't until later that people started conceptualizing "chords" as separate from melodies. Once that happened, those "chord progressions" "sound good". But, I would bet there is a many a Renaissance piece where you would say (as many have) "hey, that ended on the wrong chord". It's not the wrong chord - for them. We've been conditioned to hear a different chord as the final chord. So there's no way to make chords "sound good" in succession. The best we can do is make them sound **like** what we've heard before with the assumption if that was deemed good, so would ours. However, you can see where art could get locked into a doctrine - could you imagine if certain things were "forbidden"? It has happened - certain progressions were "astylistic" (thus essentially forbidden) but later composers came along and used them and they didn't "sound bad", it's just a new style. Some seek a "universal theory" for music and such a thing doesn't, can't, and shouldn't exist. Each style needs its own "theory" - we already do this to an extent with early Modal music - we do make distinctions in terminology and concepts because even though they both have "notes", they're not the same thing. In essence, it's like using modern "texting" grammar to define good grammar, versus the grammar of Shakespeare. They're not exactly the same thing and the differences are what describes each style. There's a book title that had "Elements of Style" in the title and really, that's what I think we should call "Music Theory" - "Elements of a Musical Style". And despite surface similarities, the elements of Modality are different from Tonality are different from Atonality are different from Jazz are different from Raga, etc.

5. Finally, there are many pseudo-scientific attempts to "explain" music most of which usually invoke the Harmonic Series. It seems many people want so desperately to know "why" a composer chose to do something and they can't accept that "that was the style at the time" or "that's what his teachers taught him, so that's what he continued to do". There's probably some psychological term for it but it seems that when people think something is **so** important (and music does move people at a very deep level in many cases) that there **must** be some "reason" for it. Most of these theories ca be found online in droves, especially it seems among guitarists (who are often the least trained but in cases highest-performing musicians). Some people grab on to this stuff like flat-earthers. I for one would prefer to understand things in their historical perspective.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Most theory texts only teach as much rhythm as is necessary for identifying other stuff, such as phrase lengths, cadences, etc.

They also don't delve into counterpoint beyond the very basics.

Robert Gauldin's "Practical Approach to 18th Century Counterpoint" is a great book with real-world musical examples (the kind that most people are interested in learning about, unlike Fux) and exercises. If you're looking to "write" (compose) it could be just what you're looking for.

Gauldin also has a Theory text (Structural Functions in Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> I think) that also takes more of a practical approach to harmonization and voice-leading, rather than the more "rule-based" approach of some other authors.

I fear though, you've falllen into the common trap of trying to learn music by *reading* about music instead of **playing** music.

4 semesters of undergraudate theory courses did not teach me as much about chorale-writing as sitting down and playing through Bach's Chorales repeatedly (you could do one a day with the 371 edition and not take much more than a year but can easily sit down and play20 or 30 a day if you're so inclined and can play).

You need to listen to and actively play (and maybe write) the music and immerse yourself in that music to really get a handle on it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I didn't bother listening to the song, but a couple of things to point out:

1. Not all music is tonal.

2. Not all music is in keys.

3. Even in tonal music (which is by nature, in keys) are **all** passages tonal.

4. Not all <b><u>harmony</u></b> is "functional".

5. Chromatic Mediants are defined as having the same **quality**, so Bb to D are CMs, and Bbm to Dm are CMs, but Bbm to D is not. Some people use a term "Double Chromatic Mediant" to mean this, but I've also seen that term to describe two chords whose roots are a tritone apart and are the same quality.

6. If you're analyzing a passage and not coming up with any I and V chords, you're in the wrong key! Fm chords are neither borrowed nor really secondary to D Major. This pretty much means you're not in D Major (though it's possible you could be in no key at all).

7. Fm makes more sense obviously, however another thought could be C Minor, using iv and V - in either of those cases the move to F#m would have to be a modulation of some sort.

8. There's something called a German+6 that looks and acts similarly to a TTSub. It normally appears on b6 and resolves to V. If it instead resolves to I, it'd be Ger+6/I. So that would be analogous to a TTSub (on b2). But it traditionally can appear a half step above any scale degree in a key. It works a little differently than a TTSub, but the sounds are similar. Since I didn't listen to the piece, I'd say if it's at all "Jazzy" sounding, TTSub is the better term, while if more "Classical" in nature, Ger+6.

9. Finally, the notes you use over a CM are those that sound good and/or give the effect you want! If you were in D Major and an F Major chord appears (borrowed, but also a CM) you'd use F-A-C, and likely the remainder of the notes of D Major would sound OK - D-E-G-B - however, since it comes from the Minor Mode of D, you'd want to try the Bb as well - one would give a Major sound over F, the other a Lydian sound over F.
If instead you went from D to F#, it's not a borrowed chord (nor a secondary) so your choices become F#-A#-C# and possibly the remainder from D, but in this case since it's not as closely a related key, it may sound like more of a "shift" and you may need to begin with notes from F# Major. F# Mixolydian or F# Harmonic Major might also work well as each of those two add more notes in from the original D key. But it really depends on the context.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>F-A-C-E-G is F Major 9.
C-E-G-B-D is C Major 9.

However, both are voiced in "Quartal Voicings" which means the notes, rather than stacked largely or primarily in 3rds, appear more specifically (and focusing on) the intervals of 4ths and 5ths (and 2nds).

Sometimes, if the piece is written this way throughout or for large sections, we say it is "Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" which means the chords are made from chords stacked in 4ths rather than the more traditional "Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" which is chords stacked in 3rds.

However, there's a bit of grey area because the inversion of a 4th is a 5th:

C-F is a 4th, but F-C is a 5th.

And if we stack two 3rds, like F-A then A-C they are bounded by F-C still - a 5th.

So sometimes, the chords may still be more tertian-based, just **voiced** "quartally" (or "quintally" if we like).

I think this composition (or the arrangement at least) leans more towards "purer" Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - for reasons I'll try to point to along the way.

Chord 3 is a Bb Major 9, then Chord 4 is D Major 13.

Now, these terms are somewhat arbitrary because what I'm doing is "putting them in tertain order" to come up with a familiar name.

But honestly, when you listen to it, saying FMaj9 might make sense for the first, but the next two chords of CMaj9/E and BbMaj9/D start to make little sense in a tertian context - the Bb especially begins to sound "more minory" with a flatted interval on top - almost makes more sense to think of it as some "D-Rooted" chord with an added b6.

Part of the beauty of these voicings is that they do sort of sit in this grey area between Quartal and Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. And I'm willing to bet that a Jazz player who's used to these voicings might hear them as leaning more towards familiar 9th and 13th sounds (I'd be interested to know if any read this) where I coming from a little more classical background tend to hear them more as the quartal harmonies I think they were maybe intended to be. But we all always bring our own listening prejudices into a piece!

The next chord is F-B-E which again is purely Quartally voiced, so we can argue if the tertian name of FMaj7#11 is appropriate or not.

Notice that the melody moves mostly by 2nds and 4ths as well (if you stack C-G-D or C-F-Bb - 4ths or 5ths, you'll notice that the difference between the outer notes is 2nd, so 2nds, 4ths, and 5ths and to some degree 7ths, and often the avoidance of 3rds and 6ths are hallmarks of Quartal music).

We could coalesce these melody notes into chord tones - again, I would argue that that's not wholly appropriate in a piece like this, but if we add E-D-A (which is another quartal stack - E-A-D) to the F-B-E, we get F-B-E-A-D - a larger quartal structure, which again could be (but should it be?) realized as F Major 13(#11).

I suppose, if you just absolutely have to have names for them, there you go.

The next chord continues in this fashion - A-D-G, adding C melodically (a continuation of 4ths).

Interestingly, it does use a B note in the melody. So that actually brings up a really interesting question - because thus far it seems like all of the notes present are related by 4th or if a melodic line, can be understood as a 4ths collection - with no "missing 4ths" between notes.

The B here would have skipped the F (after the C in the stack).

So we get into questions like was that 4th stacking an important structural composition process, or is the B something like a traditional "non-chord tone" and so on. Lots of food for thought there.

The piece is too long to go through the whole thing, but what I would suggest to you is, since maybe we believe there's this idea of structural Quartal Chords (or at least voicings) being the "basis" for the piece, to go through and see if you can find the "4ths stacks" for each accompanimental chord, and then see if the melody notes also do it, or expand on it, etc.

This, IMHO, would be far more instructive to understanding the piece and the way this type of <b><u>harmony</u></b> works than to just "name" all of the chords.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Having taught Music Theory in college at all levels, my prognosis is not good.

Usually, students in your position that hope to pull out a "Hail Mary" and score that 92 never do it.

I'm not trying to discourage you, but be realistic. Don't give up, but you're going to need to bust ass, not fart around on the internet looking for false hope (and that's partly what gets some people into these situations).

We are on a semester system and at this point, it's too late We only have about 2 full weeks and exam week left.

Without knowing where your problems are, we would all just be throwing spaghetti at the wall trying to hopefully find you a good resource.

Honestly, your best resource is the instructor of the course. Next would be classmates or people who are a course ahead. They're all going to know what was covered and in the case of the instructor may even be able to identify your weak spots.

And there are far too many "theory" websites - most written by people who actually didn't study any theory beyond what they learned off the internet or from a fellow guitarist or something. The links in the sidebar down below are an excellent resource but if you're studying CPP <b><u>Harmony</u></b> the jazz sites are only going to confuse you and get you wrong answers.

Talk to your teacher. That is your best resource at this point.

Another Redditor just posted this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/7f9gcv/questions_about_one_summers_day_by_joe_hishaishi/

Though I responded in that thread and I'm seeing this more as Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, you can see that the 2nd and more so, the 3rd chords have a "mb6" feel/sound to them.

There's an additional note, but for simplicity's sake, they sound less like C/E and Bb/D in this context than they do Emb6 and Dmb6 in this context - again especially the 2nd one to me (they'd be b13 chords if we include the 7th which I believe are actually more common).

The E and B, then the D and A sore of "stablize" the chord as "rooted" in E and D (just like the first seems rooted in F) and thus make the "added" note that's a m6 above the root sound like an "extension" rather than the actual root of the chord (and this makes sense with the way we hear a b13 added in other chords).

So totally different approach, but the sound is there, so that might give you an idea of what I was talking about initially.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Wow, wish I could help.

All I know of are books like those by Piston, Dallin, Smith-Brindle, Persichetti, and the like that discuss 20th century principles and usually Impressionism as sort of a bridge between tonality and post-tonality (not necessarily to Expressionism or Atonality). Then there are all the typical college texts that just devote a couple of chapters to post-Romanticism. Kostka has a book on 20th century <b><u>harmony</u></b> I've not read but I wonder if it sort of picks up where Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> left off or if it goes further into 20th century techniques.

Robert Gauldin has a few chapters at the end of his <b><u>harmony</u></b> text that I recall analyzes a few things like Claire de Lune - I think with the intention of showing they're not as distant from tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> as we would at first think.

I think the Leon Dallin had a lot of good information that really was the most "bridging" between tonality and later styles, though it's been a long time since I pulled it out of storage...

I'll be interested to hear other posters' responses.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hmm, tough call.

Do you have any kind of Arts Schools or what we here in the US call "Magnet" schools? They're usually designed for High School age students (here, roughly 14-18) as a more focused study in an arts field such as music, art, theater, dance, etc.

Most of them act as sort of "prepatory" schools for entry into a university music program.

Otherwise, would it be possible for you to take any classes at either a local University or music school associated with the University? Many offer summer classes here that are open to non-degree seeking students. Also, there may be "schools of music" of music teacher who teach violin, and piano, and voice, and guitar, and tuba, and etc. etc. etc. that all teach out of the same location. Usually they can recommend a good teacher so even if it's not guitar, they might have someone that can teach you theory.

But really, studying with a teacher who knows theory, or augmenting lessons with theory instruction is your best bet. Theory by itself is an abstraction - it's better for you to learn it in a musical context, especially one where you can apply what you learn.

You were playing what I'd call "Classical Guitar" which is "art music" for Nylon String Acoustic Guitar. I know those pieces and they are considered "recital level" pieces at my university - IOW they're not "beginner" pieces.

To be hones with you, Classical musicians tend to study <b><u>harmony</u></b> on their own less because they're concentrating on learning the established repertoire for their instrument. Usually, they major in music and get their theory education there. And generally that's about all the theory they ever need.

I'm not sure when you say "I have other passions too" - are they musical? Or are you talking Football (we call it Soccer here)?

I mean, to be honest, if you just have a "passing interest" in guitar, I'm not really sure that learning any theory is going to help you rekindle that interest.

When you say "I don't have any theoretical knowledge" what do you mean. Can you read music? I would assume so if you're playing those pieces.

Are you saying you don't know what chords you're playing?

Are you losing interest in "classical" guitar and would rather play pop or jazz styles?

What is your goal here?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ok, when most people ask about "modes" they mean 7 note scales that are "rotations" of a parent scale.

By that, I mean if we take:

A B C D E F G

and move the A to the end (rotate it) we get:

B C D E F G A

then same process

C D E F G A B

etc.

Ultimately this yields 7 rotations which we have names for. Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolain, and Locrian.

Since most of us learn Major/Minor scales first - and unfortunately most people are taught from a "Major Centric" point of view, there's a lot of people out there who refer to 6 modes as "rotations" of a "parent scale" a Major Scale (or Ionian if you like).

Thus you may hear things like "Dorian is the 2nd mode, and Phrygian is the 3rd, etc. When that's said, it's becuase it's referencing those modes back to Ionian which is seen as the "first" mode (historically, it wasn't even one of the first modes though!).

What makes each of the 7 modes unique is that the arrangement of Half and Whole steps in relation to the "tonic" (starting note) is unique. Since we often use this concept for Major and Minor, it makes sense to extend it to the other modes as well. So we might describe Phrygian as having half steps between scale degrees 1 and 2 and 5 and 6 - and no other mode has that arrangement.

Now, all this is fine and dandy, but IMHO it's a bad way to think about it - and it's the primary thing that causes confusion. You'll see lots of posts like "Isn't F Lydian the same as C Major?" and "when I solo over the C chord, I change to C Lydian right?".

It's rampant among guitarists, who play scalar patterns starting on different notes and they'll even call fingering patterns "modes" when really, they're just simply X scale starting on Y note. Not a "mode" at all.

So, IMHO, a better, and more musical way to comprehend the modes is just like we do with Major and Minor - becuase a lot of music that uses modes while modal, *treats them as if* they are tonal (major/minor system).

So referencing them to Major and Minor (or Ionian and Aeolian) can make more sense.

Dorian is like Minor with a raised 6.
Phrygian is like Minor with a lowered 2

Lydian is like Major with a raised 4.
Mixolydian is like Major with a lowered 7.

And Locrian is like minor with a lowered 2 and 5.

So think about this for a second. If someone asks for a G Dorian mode, a lot of people can't figure it out. Because they're going "OK, so Dorian is Mode 2, so the parent mode for G must be F, or wait, is is F#, or wait, if G is 1 then A is 2..." then they get all confused. If they're lucky they get "DOrian is Mode 2, so that would mean for G Dorian I want F Major as the parent scale, so I use the key signature for F, which is one flat, and play the notes starting on the 2nd note of an F Major scale".

And the problem there is that's not music. You're just "playing a scale starting on the 2nd note" and worse, your brain is thinking F. So a lot of times, in practical application, people can't figure out what chords to play with it now.

So if you think about it the other way - Dorian is like minor, with a raised 6.

So you take G Minor, which is G A Bb C D Eb F G and just raise the 6th note one half step making it:

G A Bb C D E F.

Then, any chords you make will use the notes of the mode.

G-Bb-D is i; C-E-G is IV; D-F-A is v.

Right away you should notice it's a "minor" mode, but the IV chord is major. And that major IV chord gives this mode it's "flavor". Further, it's the thing that makes it "decidedly not Aeolian"!

So if you try to play these notes over those chords, you'll be centering yourself on G, and you'll be in the mindset of G Dorian, not some other parent scale (which we haven't even bothered to figure out in this example).

_________________

Minor and Major are "related" in that like the modes, Relative Keys share the same notes. We usually talk about a pair, like C Major is Relative to A Minor. This means they share the same key signature. You may have learned that "minor is just a Major scale, starting on the 6th note".

That's true, and that's this "rotation" principle again. So it's actually just like the other modes - but if you only know Major and Minor you're kind of just not using the other 5 modes. But they are all related in the same way - they're all rotations of each other.

However, a second way (and often more practical) to look at Minor is as the 2nd way I looked at modes. A Minor scale is a Major scale with its 3rd, 6th, and 7th lowered. So if you want C Minor, you don't go "what's the Relative Major so I can find the Key Signature".

You start with C Major:

C D E F G A B

and lower those notes:

C D Eb F G Ab Bb

And this process is useful because we can also see Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor as alterations of Major (or start with Minor for fewer steps).

_____________________________________________

There are many 5-note scales, but again most people mean "the" Pentatonic Scale, which we tend to talk about as:

C-D-E-G-A.

Now, here's where things get a bit tricky: You can also "rotate" this mode and it will create 5 unique patterns. We call the original the Major Pentatonic and one of the rotations - that happens to begin on the same note as the relative minor, is usually called Minor Pentatonic:

A-C-D-E-G (see how the A is just moved to the beginning of the line?).

But, once again, I don't think that's always as useful a way to think about them.

Instead, those scales are better thought of as 5 note subsets of Major and Minor scales. So in this case, the "parent" scale is the 7 note version, and we just leave out 2 notes to get a 5 note version of the scale.

The reason it's better to think of it this way is in tons of music that's exactly how it's treated. No one makes music out of Pentatonic Scales (the kind of pop stuff I'm talking about). Instead, they make music in a Major Key, and use all 7 notes for their <b><u>harmony</u></b>. But, they might restrict their melody to just 5 notes from the scale - making the **melody** Pentatonic.

And it's used heavily by guitarists, especially in improvisation.

Why? Because by "restricting" the note set to only 5 notes, you've got a better chance than the notes you're playing will sound good against the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - fewer notes, fewer clashes. It also happens to leave out the more clashy notes - the interval of the tritone, which clashes with itself, and the half steps, with clash with chords. So it's a "safer" set of notes to use for improvising.

Now normally, you would use Major Pentatonic over a Major key chord progression and Minor Pentatonic over a minor key chord progression.

But, in Blues, we use "blue notes". And those "blue notes" are ones that are somewhat in disagreement with the Major key.

So in what would usually be a Major Key, the blue notes are the b7 and b3.

It just so happens, if you play Dorian Mode, you've got the notes from Major, but with b3 and b7!

So it can sound very "bluesy".

But, it still has that pesky tritone and those half steps.

So what if you could get rid of those and do like you do with a pentatonic?

Well, you can, and you end up with the same thing as Minor Pentatonic - which more people are familiar with so that's what it's called.

So, for example, in an A Blues, you might improvise with an A MINOR Pentatonic scale, becuase it contains the "safer" notes A, D and E (1, 4, and 5) and the two blue notes, C, and G.

It became sort of a "cheat" - "hey man, if you want to sound bluesy without really knowing what you're doing, then just play this 5 note scale man".

So you may hear people say "The Blues Scale" and it turns out to be Minor Pentatonic (sometimes with an added b5 which is another blue note).

But really blues music actually uses something a little more complex than that.

____________

There are more complex ways to think of both of these - for exmaple, you can play a Bm pentatonic in the key of G Major and it gives you a different "flavor". It's still just restricting your note choices, but seeing it as a "named pattern" can really help you find your way. Likewise, modes can be used in other contexts that again produce different "flavors" and that gets into topics that involve quite a few more lengthy posts, so I'll stop here.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ok, each historical period or style is given a name. Often these roughly reflect similar movements and names in the Art and Literary worlds.

Many people often use the term "Classical" to refer to orchestral and chamber music in general.

However, there is a "Classical Period".

There is a lot of overlap between periods - so dates are just rough, not concrete boundaries, but basically we have:

Baroque (1600s to 1750s)

Classical (1730s to 1820s)

Romantic (1780s to 1900s)

And all of those are "ish" - you'll see a lot of "circa" when describing these periods.

Collectively this is what most people consider "Classical" music - Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, etc.

It is also the "Common Practice Period" (or Common Practice Era) and the "Tonal Era". So Tonality (with a capital T referring to the period) and CPP are synonymous. And the way most people use the word "Classical" also generally refers to music of mainly this time period as well.

Prior to this, there was Modality.

So breakdown:

1. Modality - about 500 to 1600

2. Tonality - about 1600 to 1900

3. Atonality - about 1920 to the present. However, we should note that Atonality is just one style of many after Tonality and some composers continue to write in everything from Tonal to highly Tonal styles. Many theorists have used a term called "Centricity" or Centric Music to refer to music that promotes a tone center, but does not use traditional Tonal trappings to do so. However, both Modality and Tonality might be seen as distinct style of Centrality, and what we have now is a post-Tonal, modal-tonal hybrid, for which no name exists (or is in common use). When I was younger and it was still the 20th century, we just called it "Contemporary <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" or "20th Century <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" but since about 1900 (or a tad earlier) there have been an explosion of various styles.

Modality initially was melody only - no <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> began to evolve and we do have Modal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, but this is not Jazz.

With the rise of Tonality, Modality kind of fell into disuse, and it wasn't until around the later 1800s when Modality was "rediscovered" if you like, and composers started using it as a resource. In some ways though, they really used Modality not like the pre-Tonal style, but in a hybridized style that sort of looked at modes (and other scales) as pitch resources, but treated them in Tonal context - it wasn't Tonality per se, but they adapted many Tonal practices to modality.

Modal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in Jazz is yet another new development.
____________

Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> or CPP <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is Triad-Based meaning the Triad is the "basic harmonic unit" - Such as a C Major chord. 7th chords are used, but are considered dissonant chords in need of resolution. 9ths and larger don't really happen until later in the era and 11ths and 13ths are so rare for the bulk of the era that no one really discusses them as part of this kind of <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

In Jazz <b><u>Harmony</u></b> on the other hand, the 7th chord is the "basic harmonic unit" and extensions and alterations are common. Even with more basic chords, if not 7ths, the were 6ths or 6/9 chords and so on. Furthermore, while dissonances can resolve in Jazz, the upper extensions aren't necessarily *treated* as dissonances - that is, they don't necessarily need to resolve (later Tonal music did this too but we can argue if it is still Tonal at that point).

_________

Chromatic <b><u>Harmony</u></b> can mean different things. In CPP Tonality, Chromatic <b><u>Harmony</u></b> usually refers to any chords that use non-diatonic notes and that's pretty much it. This can include Borrowed Chords, but includes Secondary Dominants, Neapolitans, Augmented Sixth chords and so on.

________

Linear <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in a CPP context means chords that are present as "connective tissue" rather than stand alone harmonic units. Sometimes these harmonies are resultant of simultaneous lines. We usually use the term Linear Progression instead as it's not a "type of <b><u>harmony</u></b>" so to speak.

_________


Lydian Chromatic is Jazz.

__________

Negative <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is something I thought about since I was a child. It's something I see here, but nowhere else. I don't know how widespread it is or how "accepted" the term is.

_____________

Modern <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is a catch-all, but is usually applied to Post-CPP music, rather than Jazz to my knowledge, but certainly modern Jazz uses <b><u>harmony</u></b> in a way now that it didn't at its inception - so it too has evolved.

_____________

So there are some terms that apply equally both to Jazz and to CPP music, and some terms that have different but specific meanings in Jazz, and some terms that really belong with one and not the other. Therefore you need often need the context to know what someone means.

For example with Modality, you always need to make sure which time period or style someone is talking about.

With "Chromatic" they could be referring to CPP or Jazz.

Lydian Chromatic is purely a Jazz notion.

_____________

Chronology is probably the best way to talk about them.

There is a trend to name periods and styles more specifically - look at young people on the internet today - there must be 1,000s of genres alone for songs that came out last year. R&amp;B is not the R&amp;B of the 90s, and it's not the R&amp;B of the 60s. And I didn't know what "Doom" metal was but when I listened to some I realized it was basically Black Sabbath. People have this need to feel important so they're trying to create a genre name, or concept, or whatever and hope it goes viral. It's the hashtag and "metadata" era - everything has to fit nicely in some little cubby, and if it doesn't a new cubby needs to be built for it.

But then you start to get to ridiculous minute divisions.

Just know this: CPP Tonality is not Jazz <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. There are commonalities, and they share commonalities with pre-Tonal Modality as well. And I wouldn't bother trying to learn every single concept that comes along. If you're into "classical" music, learn CPP <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and how it evolves. If you're into Jazz, learn its evolution. But if you bounce all over the place, the jazz concepts will just confuse you about CPP music and to some degree, vice versa.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm in the US and my University Education as an Undergraduate reads pretty much just like yours.

I now teach at the same University and nothing has changed, other than we switched from Kostka/Payne's Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> to the A/S one (which I actually don't like as much).

We had a "Form and Analysis" course that some majors were required to take (but not Ed or Performance IIRC). It was a separate course for which all 4 semesters of Theory were a pre-req.

K/P had an "Introduction to 20th Century Music" included in the final chapters, and we basically spent  the last month or so of semester 4 touching on 20th century techniques and the bulk of that was spent on filling in Magic Squares!

FWIW, I think most universities IME focus on CPP music for a number of reasons:

1. It's a "common practice", thus it's easily studyable and learnable and teachable - it can be distilled into rights and wrongs and rules, and from a practical concern of an Instructor teaching Students, it gives you a measurable result you can assign grades to. Not to mention, there are maybe millions of books/studies on it.

2. I think, when universities first started teaching any kind of theory back from the 1800s, everyone learned, then taught, and basically you ended up with a tradition. There weren't scholars in 20th century music in 1899, so they were teaching their students, who would be teaching in 1920, the same things.

3. In the highly prejudiced-in-everything US, a similar issue made "Classical" music acceptable, but "modern" music was out, and even early music is under-appreciated. Even now, in 2017, hearing music on the very few classical music stations from even 1917 (especially anything avant-garde) is a no go. You get Firebird, but it's not all that common to hear Rite of Spring. You get Copeland of course, but aside from the "hits", you're not getting much Piston, Barber (Adagio for Strings is it), Bartok (maybe Concerto for Orchestra) and even Hanson is going to be "The Romantic Symphony" - this overbearing behmoth of lingering overblown Romantic style music that even gets into the few "contemporary" things they play - mainly John Williams and the occasioal Elmer Bernstein or other Film Music (I'm ranting, aren't I?).
So it's assumed players are going to pursue a career in very narrow "classical" music because that's where all the jobs are. Our Symphony can pack the house with Beethoven 5, but play Hadyn 43, or any Mahler, and the Subscribers are gone. So your bread and butter for a career are Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, with a little variety for specific instruments (certain famous Piano Concerti, etc.). Thus it does you little good to study Gesualdo, or Ives as an undergraduate.

4. We are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music and to maintain that accreditation, we sort of "have" to teach what their guidelines imply. Their committees consist of people who've grown up "in the system" and it just self-perpetuates. They are slow to evolve and slow to accept change.

I wish, that Theory was taught Chronologically. I think people would have a much deeper understanding of CPP music, and a deeper appreciation of all styles of music in general.

And I suffer from these same gaps as you.

I felt like, Tonal music kept evolving (or devolving as some might put it!) but as soon as Schoenberg came along, that's what we studied.

I wanted to know how we got from Beethoven, through all the Nationalist, to the Impressionists. In some ways I feel like music continued to naturally evolve, while the 2nd Viennese School was sort of "interference" with natural evolution and has at this point become more of an offshoot that has gradually returned more towards the traditional evolution.

At any rate, I haven't found anything that bridges that gap. I haven't really been looking either though, so...

Since I was working, I focused on what I had to teach so for CPP:

A/S

K/P

Robert Gauldin (which I like the best)

Clendennin and West-Marvin

Piston

Schoenberg

all have different approaches and useful info IMHO.

For Counterpoint

Jeppesen (the "bible" on modal counterpoiunt)

Robert Gauldin, "Practical Approach to Xth Century Counterpoint" - he has one for 16th Cent. and one for 18th Cent. The former is more similar to the Jeppesen, and the latter is actually really good for those interested in CPP counterpoint.

Piston's Counterpoint (because it's more about actual "classical" music than Fux style species studies).

I have some Composition books and I recall the Persichetti, and those seem to bridge the gap a bit, but are more about compositional techniques than analysis, and tend to also be rather brief - an overview or survey rather than anything heavy:

Leon Dallin

Persichetti

(not read Kostka's or Straus' but probably should)

Finally, this can be a great resource:

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Margaritaville by Jimmy Buffet in the Verses goes:

D - D - D - D - D - D - A7 - A7

A7 - A7 - A7 - A7 - A7 - A7 - D - D7

12 bar blues:

I - I - I - I

IV - IV - I - I

V - V - I - I

(in its skeletal form)

Notice that the I chord happens for 4 measures. Without a turnaround, you get 6 in a row when you repeat. There are 16 bar blues that repeat the I even longer, or "half time" ones where the 4 measures seems like 8.

"Low Rider" by War, never really changes chords at all (granted, this and the following examples have "riffs" and may have upper notes that imply a different chord, but they're really just vamps on a single <b><u>harmony</u></b>)

"Lime in the Coconut" also is basically the same chord all the way through.

"Spill the Wine" also by War - one chord.

I was watching The Last Waltz last night and Muddy Waters did "Mannish Boy" - they played one chord the whole song.

"Whole Lotta Love" is essentially one chord throughout.

Most commonly, chords change every measure, or you get two chords per measure.

But jazz "chord-melody" style pieces often have a different chord for every melody note.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"While you're waiting"?

So you're planning to go to college to study music?

If so, I'd find out what textbook is used at that college and go ahead and buy one (would be pricey, but at least you could use it now, and then for 4 semesters in college).

Without knowing your current level, there's not much to say.

If you look at the chapter headings of a theory textbook on Google or Amazon, you'll get a good idea of the type of material covered in college classes and the order in which they're covered.

Any college course assumes you can read music, so that's where you need to start.

Don't know if you truly "suck at drums" but rhythm, while important to certain aspects of theory, is not a main part of the study.

Instead, it's all about reading Treble and Bass clef, and knowing how to figure out Alto and Tenor clef.

Most of the students I see do poorly in Theory are those that can't read the opposite clef - the Flute players fall behind because they're still figuring out how to read Bass Clef.

You will likely study Tonality, which is music of the Common Practice Period. CPP music "Key-Based" so usually your order is something like this:

Learn Notes (on both staves).

Learn Scales.

Learn Keys and Key signatures.

Learn Intervals.

Learn Chords.

Then it gets hard. And that's the level that amount of "experts" on Theory online and on YT drops off sharply. Because then you get into:

Roman Numeral Analysis (not too hard)

Figured Bass and Inversional symbols (separates the wheat from the chaff)

Voice-Leading and Part-Writing (exponentially more difficult)

Chromatic <b><u>Harmony</u></b> beginning with Secondary Dominants (really destroys a lot of people) then Borrowed Chords (and these two BTW are the biggest "unknowns" for average people on the internet who've not studied Theory in a school - more people are not aware of these things than probably anything else at these levels).

Usually intertwined in these areas are bits about Modulation, then Enharmonic Modulation, coupled with various forms like Binary, Ternary, Rounded Binary, Sonata Form, etc. Understanding Phrase Structure is tied to Motives, Phrases, and Periods, as well as Cadence.

Different texts add these in a different points; some introduce some concepts in context, others put them all together in a chapter.

Then you get into more "avanced" topics which again can be discussed in other orders, but often these consist of things of interest, but outside the realm of "textbook" CPP elements, such as Modes, Counterpoint, 20th Century <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, Jazz <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, and so on, which really deserve their own textbooks (and courses).

Walter Piston's "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>" has been used by universities, and is not horribly expensive - 56 bucks new on Amazon. Cheap for a college-level textbook.

I also find his to be one of the more "readable" ones.

If you are a drummer and don't play an instrument, by far, learning to play piano/keyboard would really really help. But any chordal instrument (Guitar is a nice 2nd choice) will make life easier for you. But **playing music** is one of the best ways to understand theory concepts. Reading about them doesn't do you all that much good unless you already have a really strong background.




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Stupid Viola: Making Theory Students learn the Alto Clef for decades now!! :-)

There are usually a decent number of String or Orchestra excerpts in Theory courses, so being able to read it will be helpful, but knowing it even better won't hurt!

Keys (Key Sigs) are Theory 1. Go ahead and try to get all of them down now! If you're a musician, you'll use them your whole life, so nice to know them. I just scaned through and saw this comment repeated in a number of responses - they're right - it's called "Tonality" which is about "Keys" - and it is all based on Keys - so knowing your Key Signatures and Major and Minor Keys (and scales) is super important.

You've got a lot of the basics from Theory I, so you'd probably be OK in a typical university-level intro course. And you'll learn what you're missing. You'll walk in the door with 75% on each topic, while some will be more like 25%. So that gives you an advantage (and a way to make food money tutoring your classmates!)

Inversional Symbols come from Figured Bass.

I is root position (G)

I^6 is first inversion (G/B)

I^6 /4 is 2nd inversion (6 is superscript, 4 is subscript directly below but in text we use a slash or dash, etc. - G/D)

Most people don't know Voice-Leading and Part-Writing, and that's why they can't pass out of Theory I on a placement test.

It's how you voice chords (taught as 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b>) and how each note of one chord leads to each note of the next chord.

Yes, D7 - G7 - C - the D7 is a secondary dominant.

In most colleges, you study Common Practice Period music, and "borrowing" happens only between Major and the parallel Minor - so in C Major, you'd get a D^o, or an Eb chord - as those come from C Minor.

Borrowing from other modes is a Jazz thing (good to know, but unless you study jazz theory specifically, it may not be a major topic).

Enharmonic means, "same note, different spelling". C# and Db are enharmonic. Probably the worst thing anyone can learn before going into theory, because it causes all sorts of problems. But in Theory 4 usually, it becomes imporatant again (in one of the more advanced topics).

I like to say that theory exists "off the paper" - but we do have to represent it on paper. What you typically do is read a piece of music, and analyze it, or, you're given some framework, like Figured Bass and you "compose" the parts (using proper voice-leading) - sometimes a melody line is given, sometimes not, but you get a bass line. Sometimes you're given a melody to harmonize in chorale style.

You don't do a lot of playing in classes, but sometimes teachers have students bring in a harmonization for instruments they have in the class, or people play it on the piano and so on.

You've got a great start and what you could really use is the kind of pedagogical approach that happens in courses - that way you don't miss anything and you get everything in a logical order, as each topic tends to build on the next.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;This is using non-functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. So it's best to think in compositional techniques rather than in Roman Numeral analysis.

I agree whole-heartedly. Assigning roman numerals is just "naming the chords with numbers" at this point.

You might as well put 1m, b2m, 1m, 7m, 1m, b2m, 2, b5.

If the chords stay in the same position (inversion) and travel up and down in parallel motion, there's a word for that compositional technique called "Planing".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_<b><u>harmony</u></b>

(FWIW I don't care for the word "parallel" associated with it this way because of Parallel Modes and their <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, so that needs disambuguating, where "Planing" is already disambiguated as it doesn't really mean anything else).

In Jazz, a similar technique is sometimes called CSH (not to be confused with CESH) for "Constant Structure <b><u>Harmony</u></b>".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hi u/Zac_TheDude

It sounds like you might be planning to study music in college?

If so, I would say you should absolutely contact the faculty at any of the universities you are planning to apply to to get an idea of what theory studies will prepare you most.

I can tell you that most of the people I am in contact go through 4 semesters of Music Theory courses using a textbook and workbook such as Kostka/Payne's "Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>", or Aldwell/Schachter's "<b><u>Harmony</u></b> and Voice Leading" or other similar texts.

Only some of our majors are required to take Counterpoint and it was an upper level course (along with Orchestration and Form and Analysis, etc.) that the 4 semesters of theory were a pre-requisite for.

It is also not really discussed in your 4 semester basic theory aside from some generalities that are incorporated into more "pressing" studies (as you have to get through material in a semester...). I remember a chapter from Kostka/Payne called "Soprano-Bass Counterpoint" and that was the main - and cursory - involvement with counterpoint proper.

That said, it's not going to hurt you to know it. If you have enough basic theory down and could easily place out of the 4 semesters of theory, then absolutely it would be the first thing you work on walking in the door.

It might be instructive, if you have a local university with a music department, to contact the faculty and see if they use a placement test for their theory courses and ask if you could do a campus visit and maybe even try the test and get some advice about where you are and where you need to be with your theory skills.

But just for a kind of analogy - one must audition to get into our program. One requirement is to be able to play certain scales depending on the instrument. When you come in the door, and flub through the scales, and go "but I'm able to improvise over changes" the answer is going to be "impressive, but you need to learn your scales". They are - even it if seems overly pedantic - a requirement to pass the audition.

So I'm not trying to imply that you're "wasting your time" working with Counterpoint. But, if your basic theory skills are not up to par (or you can push them further), that's where I'd concentrate my preparatory efforts (unless of course the school you plan to attend has an alternative curriculum).

If you're planning to go in for Composition, then I'd say Counterpoint study would be more useful than for people interested in other music majors. But, most programs are going to be looking for a portfolio of compositions. So again, it would be important to research the institution and see what they require, and go ahead and start working towards that.

Finally, if you're really serious about pursuing a music degree, it would really pay off to invest in some form of private study now especially if you are not very strong on any particular instrument. Composers would do well to have strong keyboard skills going in, and all majors do well to be strong on whatever instrument they play if not keyboard. Trying to learn theory while still learning to play your instrument is not the most effective way to do it. Many programs are looking for players first (though with composers, they tend to expect some composing work obviously) and figure they'll teach them Theory, and if needed, Counterpoint, and so on along the way.

Good luck with your studies.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;I had a question about this kind of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, where you maintain a same bass note while moving the other two notes in the chord. First of all, is there a word for this technique? Second of all, would this be considered functional? As you can see I tried to understand the function of these chords, but I always try to be aware that a progression may be non-functional.

Totally depends on the context.

When two notes of a chord change, but one note stays the same, it may simply be a common tone. For example, C-E-G moving to C-F-A is just a chord progression of I-IV. Same would happen if either the E, or G note, of the C chord stayed.

Now, sometimes, if it happens over a longer span of chords, it's called a "Pedal Tone", which comes from the idea of holding down a foot Pedal (you can play pitches with these pedals) to sustain a note while the hands play various chords above. Some of those chords may be a note of the chord, but for some chords it may not.

So sometimes we use the word Pedal to simply mean a tone that continues to appear in a string of chords, but "officially" it's a type of non-chord tone where it sort of starts as part of some chord, holds, but as other chords move above it, they often will not have that pedal note as part of the chord.

In more modern music, we extend the concept to include notes in any register (so doesn't have to be the lowest note) and even multiple notes such as guitarists commonly do by keeping the open E or E and B strings open while moving chord shapes around on lower strings.

Whether they're considered part of the chord or not itself depends on the context.

Sometimes you hear the term "dominant pedal" or "tonic pedal" and this means the note is either the dominant or tonic pitch specifically.

________________

Functional or not. Yes, for now. But read on.

_________________

You put V for C-F-A but it's actually IV. So the progression would be I - IV - I - i^o at the beginning.

However, and this is where things get tricky and why context is so important.

These chords are, shall we say, "not really chords at all". IOW, they are simultanously appearing notes that happen to make chords we recognize, but it's not "about" the chord itself. Instead, it's about melodic lines, working in tandem, above a Tonic Pedal note.

So in that light, the F chord and the C^o chord are "really" simply results of voice-leading over top of this Tonic pedal.

What maybe confuses this issue is that the resultant chords are pretty common chords so they don't seem amiss, or like non-chord tones, and so on.

Because of this, many analysts will put parentheses around a IV in a I - (IV) - I progression because the IV is not really "functional" per se, but merely an embellishment of the Tonic <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Why context is important is because it really depends on if the F and A notes are heard more prominently as connected with a melodic line and the F chord just results from their happening over the static C note, or if they appear more as a chord change and maybe less of a melodic idea (and there's a lot of grey area there of course, but suffice it to say that when quicker, like hear, we tend to hear them more as melodies, while if they were each a measure long, we'd hear them more as chords).

The i^o arises from a similar idea - the E and G from the C chord simply drop down chromatically and come back up. 

So in a sense, the F and A can be seen as diatonic Upper Neighbor Tones to the surrounding E and G notes, and the Eb and Gb can be seen as *chromatic* Lower Neighbor Tones.

Sometimes something like this, where it's "all about an embellished I chord" is called "Tonic Prolongation", which sort of means it's "all about the I chord, with some frilly melodic decorations".

But if it is seen primarily as a decoration of the Tonic <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or moving chords over a Pedal Tone, it would be non-functional from that standpoint.

However, most people would just say that a I-IV-I in a general sense falls within the realm of Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> (and most won't be familiar with this idea of (IV) being decorative so it may cause more confusion than it solves).

I'm sorry, I'm not really sure what you mean about the minor thirds over major chords.

HTH Some.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yeah, tonal center or "home" note or chord.

In piece in A minor, the "home" note is A (and home chord, Am).

Even though it's the same set of notes as C Major, it's this focus on the Am chord - hearing it a lot, chord progressions that lead up to it, and so on, that make it sound like it's "more important".

You may hear the words "Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" and that's what that's all about - Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> sort of allows us to "point to" one harmonic center above another so for example, we use a different set of chords, in a different way, to promote C as the primary center, and yet another set of chords to promote A as the primary center.

Now, because they're the same set of notes, there are some progressions that actually could make it kind of hard to be sure which of the two you were emphasizing.

So one thing that composers did is change one of the chords in Minor, so it acted like its mirror in Major. This helps the <b><u>harmony</u></b> be even more functional, and more strongly point to the A, rather than the C. That might be a little bit of the "tension" issue, but honestly that's a little too vague as both can have tension in them.

But if you play:

Am - Dm - Am - E (not Em as you'd expect) you'll hear a strong resolution to the Am chord.

If instead, you play

C - F - C - G - it will want to resolve to the C chord.

And notice, the Am progression doesn't have any C (or F or G for that matter) chords in it. And vice versa.

So we "say" they are different things really because they do act different enough that people felt like it warranted being called it's own name, rather than something like "The Key of C that focuses on the 6 chord".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Honestly, Christmas will be here sooner than you know it!

What I would do is find a program like Musescore, or Finale, or Sibelius, or Notion, or anything that will let you write out notes for String Quartet and hear them play back.

You're not going to "master" Piano or Composing in 3 weeks, and you're not going to master any particular style, as Common Practice <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is different from Jazz is different from contemporary Pandiatonic music is different from modern Centric music is different from Avant-Garde/Experimental music.

You'd almost be better off to pick something like "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen" and use the existing notes and transcribe it for String Quartet, or make an arrangement of some other existing song where the melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> are all written out for you and all you need to do is convert it to strings.

Even if you do feel the need to compose your own piece, a program like those mentioned above will give you immediate feedback on how things things sound and will give you much more information than plunking away at an instrument.

No offense, but it seems you don't really know much about part-writing, and you're not going to learn it in a couple of weeks. Your last sentence is telling - you're saying you "know" stuff that really is only applicable to a very specific style. If you want it to sound like a perfect reproduction of Mozart, you need to follow the same rules Mozart did. But the fewer of those rules you fully understand, it's going to be a pastiche or even a parody at best.

Forget all the parallels and crap - we're 200 years past that. Listen to some pieces you like and start inputting notes in a program to get something you like the sound of - forget about "correct" - you don't have the time to learn correct for a 200 year old style (or any style for that matter unless you're already heavily into it).

The other advantage to using a program is you can actually print out the music as well as make audio files from it, so your gift could include a nicely presented score with a link to the file on YT or Soundcloud or iTunes or the Musescore site or whatever so that the person has something to keep and cherish.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>u/HrvojeS

OK, here's the issue:

When building chords in minor, on scale degree  7, the **most common** states is as in Harmonic minor (chords = <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, get it?).

It is so common, they see no need to put a "#" in front of the Roman Numeral.

With VI, #vi^o is *comparatively* rare, so the symbol is deemed necessary.

In fact, because it's so common for vii^o to appear instead of VII built on the natural minor version of the scale degree, manye people in text now put "bVII" to avoid confusion.

While bVII might be rarer than vii^o, it's not anywhere near as rare as #vi^o.

FWIW, there are a number of different Roman Numeral systems. This is one of the most widely accepted ones. And this system is more informative than "all upper case" Roman Numerals because the case of the RN tells you if the chord is Major or Minor.

Other systems look like this:

I II III IV V VI VII

Might as well use an Arabic Number.

There's nothing "illogical or inconsistent" about this system - it explains why this is in the text, and it's based on actual music, which is an art, not a science, and sometimes inconsistencies are used because they are most informative about musical styles.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You're reading a textbook on Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. <b><u>Harmony</u></b> of the Common Practice Period.

Those chords didn't appear then so there was no reason to come up with a designation for them.

You'll notice there are not numerals for a C# Major chord, or F# minor chord listed in this either.

It only lists diatonic chords, and those that can also be made by using raised scale degrees 6 or 7, and for those, it shows you which are most commonly used and explains that the naming convention was based on commonality.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes - harmonic minor = <b><u>harmony</u></b> - :-)

People never seem to get this!!!

To blow your mind a little further, actually, the "Harmonic Minor Scale" (or let's call it the note, because it's really all about raised 7) is actually not even used on III or, for 7th chords, on I (ImM7).

So though they list III+ as a possibility it's actually so rare as to be not a possibility. The few places where one runs across something that might be a III+, they're almost always a result of voice-leading (non-chord tone) or some other chord, like V+/X.

Likewise, "ii" is super rare (almost always something else) and viiø7 in minor doesn't happen (that's m7b5).

IOW, the "Leading Tone" - raised scale degree 7 - is only used *harmonically* when the chord has a Dominant Function specifically - which means, V and vii^o .

#6 is generally used only on IV and #vi *almost exclusively in conjunction with a vii^o of V chord because of **melodic** movement between the chords.*
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Easy. Here's a scale:

A B C D E F G (A)

The "scale degrees" are just numbers for those notes:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (8)

You know we build chords using every other letter, right? That's called "Tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>" (in thirds).

A-C-E

or

C-E-G

So Roman Numerals are used to refer to Chords - but more specifically the scale degree the chord is built on.

So, in the key of A Minor above, the "3" is a C note. So a C-E-G chord will be called "III" in Roman Numerals.

D-F-A would be "IV".

There are a couple of different "numbering" systems out there:

Nashville Numbering just uses Arabic Numerals. The C Chord in the key of Am is "3". The Dm chord is "4". So their numbers look just like the scale degree numbers.

In some Jazz styles, they use RN like so: C would be III, while Dm would be IIm - All RN are uppercase, and any minor chords get a little "m" added (some people do II- though - that's a little older-fashioned especially in text becuase we dashes for so many other things).

In Classical Music, there's also an all Uppercase system. In that one, you just assumed the person knows if the chord is major or minor, so it's not unlike Nashville Numbering, just using RN - so C would be III and Dm would be IV.

But, there's a "case senstive" system where uppercase is used for Major chords and lowercase is used for minor chords - so closer to the Jazz system, but just with case - C would be III, and Dm would be iv (lowercase "IV").

Finally, popular music uses something similar to this last case-sensitive system, but is also a "major-referential" system so everything is reference to the Major key.

So in A Minor, we'd pretend it was A MAJOR and name the chords based on that. Compared to major, the root of the 3 chord is a half step lower (A Major has C# while A Minor has C natural so it's 1 half step lower). So we'd call a C chord "bIII" (flat-three). The Dm is still built on a note that's in both Am and A, so no change needed, we just make it the appropriate case - "iv".

___________________

All that all of these numbering systems do is replace specific letters with scale degrees so we can talk about chord progressions universally - outside of a specific key, or make things easy to transpose (Nashville numbering is a direct solution for studio musicians who needed to chart out things so they could change keys for various artists who'd come in and need to sing it in another key).

This way, we can say for example that all 12 Bar Blues songs have some variation of:

I - I - I - I

IV - IV - I - I

V - V - I - I

So we take the "number scheme" and just plug in the chords for the key. In the key of G, G = I, C = IV, and D = V.

In the key of A, A = I, D = IV, and E = V. In the key of C, C = I, F = IV, and G = V and so on.

Sometimes, in cases like this, we take the numbers "generically" meaning they could be a major or minor key.

So sometimes you'll see someone say that "II-V-I" is the basis of Jazz or something like that (and you'll often see 2-5-1 as well).

But you'll also see "ii-V-I" which tells you specifically they're thinking a Major key, because in Major keys, ii is always minor, V is Major, and I is Major (and this BTW is yet another use for the RNs).

Now someone can go "we start on the five chord" and everyone knows if the key is G, that's going to mean you start on a D chord. In writing, we'd probably put "V" chord (or sometimes 5 if the person is from various other experiences).

____________________

Back to Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

We build chords in thirds, so we use 1-3-5 to make an Am chord in Am.

We could also say we use 3-5-7 to make the C chord, and 4-6-8 to make the Dm chord.

But, when talking about "chord members" instead of scale degrees, we're talking about them *in relation to the ROOT of the chord*.

So all triads are made up of a Root, Third, and Fifth, or 1-3-5 (I'll put R-3-5 to reinforce that, but it's not common to see it written that way).

The "3" of a C chord is an E note. The "third of the chord". The 5th is a G note. With me?

So when we make 7th chords, the reason they're called 7th chords is becuase we've stacked another 3rd on top of our R-3-5 structure.

R-3-5-7 - now we have a "7th chord" (interesting side note - a really long time ago they called triads "chords of the 5th" - we just dropped that once they became the most common basic structure and only use the numbers on 7ths and higher).

We can keep stacking more 3rds to get "taller" chords - chords with "extensions":

R-3-5-7-9-11-13.

There are only 7 notes in the scale, so you can only have 7 chord members this way (numbers that is).

The 9, 11, and 13 are the same notes as the 2, 4, and 6 but we use the 8+ numbers when talking about chords that are "tertian stacks".

Thus a "9th chord" has R-3-5-7-9 in it (some notes are sometimes dropped, but let's not go there yet).


With a Roman Numeral, we just put V7, or V9, V11, or V13.

So all those mean is that the "five" chord - which in the key of C will be G-B-D has a 7th, 9th, 11th, and/or up to 13th added to it. Thus, here are your possibilities:

G-B-D-F-A-C-E (see how all 7 notes of C are in there?)

G-B-F is the triad. G or in C, V.

G-B-D-F is G7, or V7

G-B-D-F-A is G9, or V9

and so on (and again, we do leave out some notes and there are differences between things like "9" and "add9" chords but let's hold off on that).

All of these "extensions" may be "altered" (sometimes people call those "tensions" but they also use the word generically for any extension as well).

So if you see something like V^7b9 (sometimes V^b9 ) it means the note that is the 9th above the Root (the chordal 9th) has been lowered 1 half step ("altered" if you like).

So our:

G-B-D-F-A - which is G9, becomes:

G-B-D-F-Ab which is G^b9 (or G7b9 commonly).

_____________________

Now here's an important point:

Personally, I don't really see written music that uses RNs to play from. Instead, letter names are used - Gm7b5 rather than iim7b5.

RNs are instead generally reserved for analysis and often the extensions aren't added in long strings behind them unless necessary. In fact, since Jazz is so improvisatory, things like "alt" chords aren't even specified - nor is voicing - and if someone sees "C7" they're just as likely to play C9, or C7#11, or Cadd9, or even other chord substitutions.

So Roman Numerals are generally reserved for analysis purposes, and to give general harmonic outlines that tell you the basic root movement and basic harmonies that, in styles like Jazz, tensions may be added to at will.

Letter names on the other hand, can be more specific (and sometimes people think they are meant to be specific when they're not, which opens an entirely different can of worms). But if I see "C7" in a rock song, I'm probably going to play a C7, not anything fancier than a 9th, lest it sound "too jazzy". But a jazz player may extend and alter in all kinds of ways in a jazz style.

_________________

A final important point:

There are also "chord formulas" and "scale formulas" that use Arabic Numerals and are "root" or better, "Major Keynote-referential" as well.

So they're like "chord members" but we use them specifically rather than generically.

So a  Major Triad is considered 1-3-5, and a Minor Triad is 1-**b3**-5

Likewise, a Mixolydian Scale would be written in reference to Major:

1 2 3 4 5 6 **b7** (8)

Phrygian looks like:

1 b2 b 3 4 5 b6 b7 (8)

And if you build a chord in Mixolydian on scale degree 5, it's going to have scale degrees 5, b7, and 2, which translates to 1-b3-5, so it's a minor chord.

That means while "V" is "V" in a major key, it's going to be "v" (minor five) in the Mixolydian mode.

Likewise, a chord built on b7 in Mixolydian is going to be called "bVII" and in Phrygian, a chord on b2 is going to be "bII".

So just for comparison, in RN, here they are for a few modes in a Major referential system, with upper and lowercase numerals:

Major - I - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - vii^o

Minor - i - ii^o - bIII - iv - v - bVI - bVII

Mixolydian - I - ii - iii^o - IV - v - vi - bVII

Phrygian - i - bII - bIII - iv - v^o - bVI - bvi

(man I hope I got all those right...)

____________________________

And also, extensions are what they are in the key, so in Mixolydian, the seventh chord on I is not going to be IMaj7 like it is in a Major key, but I7 (which means Major-minor 7th chord construction).

Now, there's a whole thing about how you name Major, Minor, Dominant, Half-Diminished, and Fully-Diminished 7th chords as well as various extended versions which is another post, so I'll leave this at that.

But that's the reader's digest as much as possible on how Roman Numerals and Extensions work.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If it's "melodic" the best word is probably Countermelody.

However, if it's just playing the upper note of a 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> or something, it's just part of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. No real name for that (other than like "Trumpet Part" or if more than one, "Trumpet 1" etc.).

Maybe "Obbligato"?

Sometimes that word is used to mean an important part that needs to be included.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obbligato
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Composers certainly used A#^o or Bb^o

It is the vii^o chord in the key of B Major or B minor, or Cb Major (Cb Minor doesn't really exist per key signature, but would be possible with accidentals written in the music).

They could also use that chord to lead to a B Major or Minor or Cb Major or Minor chord as a secondary leading tone chord.

It just doesn't appear in the key of C Minor.

1. Because it's not diatonic to the key.

2. Because it can't be borrowed from the parallel key.

3. Because it can't be a secondary chord to any chord in the key.

Now, it could be, enharmonically, a C#^o7 or an E^o7 .

C# is vii^o7 of D so it could appear as vii^o7 / ii in C Major.

E^o7 is vii^o7 of F so it could appear as vii^o7 / IV or iv in C Major or minor.

So that collection of notes could happen in the key of C/Cm, but it would never be any type of "Seven" chord it would be a vii^o from a Secondary Key.

Tonal music is all based on KEYS, hence the name.

So our primary chords come from the key.

Once we use chords from outside of the key, we're in a different key.

So seeing something like a #iv isn't going to happen in C - if we see that chord (which would be F#m) we wouldn't be in C anymore.

Caveat: There are "color" chords used in the very late Romantic Period as we transition into Impressionism and "20th Century" music that we can assign names like "II" (which happens in neither a major or minor key) or "#IV" but the bulk of these tend to be major and minor triads (major mostly).

Another point is, in the Tonal Era, **functional** <b><u>harmony</u></b> is important and Roman Numerals are not simply "Naming chords" - they are in fact also showing **function**.

So for example, a D Chord appearing in C Major doesn't just get "II". It's special, because it's not from the key - it's *functioning* differently than a normal ii chord. So we give it a special name and symbol (Secondary Dominant, V/V) to point out its function.

A Bb or A# diminished chord appearing in C would be very unlikely in any kind of functional context. So we don't really have a "name" for it because it's such a rare occurrence in that kind of capacity.

The chord itself is not impossible, but it's going to have some sort of special thing happening that we're going to give it a special name, not just call it "bvii^o or something.

This, BTW is why #vi^o gets the symbol - it's special - it's a warning that something extra is going on here.

vii^o7 on the other hand - while special in its function, is so commonplace it's ordinary in that regard and our just knowing it's that chord tells us it's a leading tone chord that often has dominant function.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No, it will show you how to alter chords as well.

It's actually a pretty elegant system.

But as I was saying above, some of the symbols are also designed to contain more information than just "naming the chord".

I see you and others discussing the more pop-oriented "Major Referential" system.

That one is even better for assigning Roman Numerals to chords to "name" them.

So your Bb-Db-Fb example could absolutely be bvii^o in the key of C.

But since you mentioned Italian and French (and assume German) - Kostka/Payne which I believe the text you have, use those names.

Those authors do that a lot and actually prefer names that include some additional meaning about the chord.

Like some authors just put #iv^o7 for an F#^o7 in the key of C. But that's just "naming the chord". K/P and other authors want to show that it's "special" and give it the symbol vii^o7/V so it carries more information with it.

Likewise, rather than just bII^6 they go with "N^6 " for Neapolitan Sixth.

I've seen some who label the Italian, German, and French +6 chords with RN and inversion symbols, treating them all as some type of inverted 7th chord on II or whatever.

I suppose if you recognize that the RN they use is unusual, you'll know what it means, but K/P, by calling it "Ger+6" give you a much better depth of information about it in the name alone.

A great one is the "Common Tone Diminished Seventh Chord" (which actually seems to have caught on worldwide) as "ct^o7 ".

Again, it's not really acting like a regular old vii^o7 or even vii^o7 /? so the "name" rather than an abstract numeral gives it a lot more meaning and immediately tells you more about it.

So yeah, if you just want to use numerals to "name chords", then the Major Referential system is already in use and works perfectly for almost everything.

But Common Practice Tonality is a different style and the types of chords in use were more limited and unusual chords happen under very specific circumstances - so their approach is to point that out when that happens with a special name and/or symbol - otherwise differentiation between Diatonic and Chromatic <b><u>Harmony</u></b> becomes obscured - and since that's not what Tonality is about, you don't want to muddy the waters.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, you have to remember that we're all conditioned by our listening experiences.

If you've not heard a lot of classical or traditional music in your life and only heard maybe rock or pop, or folk cadences, a bVII - I might sound very "final" to you.

As a counter example, I've played Palestrina's music (Renaissance music) to my students and they'll invariably go, "wait, that ended on the wrong chord".

No, it ended on the correct chord for Renaissance modality. But we're listening to it with modern-informed (or for them classically-informed) ears.

The answer to your question here is sort of historical.

Early on, the primary resolution in Monophonic music (no <b><u>harmony</u></b>) was 2-1.

When we started getting the beginnings of Polyphony and counterpoint, the resolution was 2-1 against 7-8  - so you can think of it like the Tonic (called the Final at that time) was approached by a note above and below.

At some point, when they added a 3rd voice, they were ending on perfect 5th chords and the 5th would also be approached by step.

So "the" Cadence was:

Bb - C
F - G
D - C

In Mixolydian  and Dorian that chord would be Bb (so there's your Bb - C!); in Phrygian it would be Bbm; in Lydian, Bm.

For some reason - probably mostly taste - as there are two with the same chord and people might have just been getting more tired of it or tastes were changing - they started altering the Bb so it was the "leading tone".

Gradually, Mixolydian and Lydian morphed into Ionian (Major) and Ionian had this characteristic, as did Lydian, so it just kind of "took over" (and in a way, "neutered" the modes).

They were already doing it in Dorian, so when Aeolian (Minor) came along it was a natural evolution.

But, when we got to what became the Major/Minor system, the things that had made each mode distinct had kind of been smooshed into just these two "modes" - Major and Minor. And the difference between those two was gone if they used the exact same notes.

Minor key music had a danger of drifting towards Major. So by retaining this idea they had for hundreds of years, it maintained some distinction between the two "modes" that kept them apart (and the music had become more harmonic based rather than contrapuntal, so that comes into play too).

As the Major/Minor system evolved, I think people wanted that stuff back - I mean, they again got bored with the sounds. So instead of V to I, they started bringing back IV to I (Plagal Cadences) then experimenting with those - one of the staples of later Romantic music is a "minor plagal" cadence which is iv - I.

In C, this means an Ab is introduced. So plagal cadences "surround the 5th" by step, and Authentic (V-I) cadences "surround the tonic".

The "new" sound was sort of this b6 - it was sort of like the "unleading tone" - it pulled down, instead of up. It's part and parcel of the sound of the so-called Phrygian Half Cadence (itself a nod to earlier music) and when done in Major, the b6 has the same kind of downward pull that a raised 7 does in Minor - at least to the ears of the people at that time.

We may be "burned out" on these cadences (though I think we find the plagal ones more interesting).

But this idea of "surrounding" the chord tone by step is really old and we seem to just keep re-inventing it in different ways - leading to different notes of the tonic triad.

So yeah, Bb7 to C (or Cm) has a certain "finality" to it especially once you're used to it and conditioned to hear that in that context.

But there's a huge tradition of hearing the Leading Tone ascend to the Tonic - and if you've experienced music in that capacity most of your life, that's probably going to sound the strongest for you.


For the TL/DR - 7 was raised in minor to keep it from drifting towards Major, thus preserving the individuality of the two "modes" in the Major/minor system.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Realistically, no, because the way using raised 7th evolved predates tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b>. So it's really kind of an oversimplification of something that had already been happening for other reasons.

But it is quite easy to see with most people's "major centric" ears and trianing that many of those Bach chorales that begin i - V/III - III (or i - bVII - III if you like) suddenly sound like they've modulated to the relative major almost as soon as they've begun.

Bach will usually quickly introduce a chord with the leading tone in it to pull us back to the relative minor mode.

So I'd say, yes, composers did do such things - whether it was a fear of it drifting towards major - they probably didn't hear it or conceptualize it in that way (but I could be wrong) but circumstantial evidence would point to an awareness that being in minor, and playing a lot of IIIs and bVIIs didn't sound very much like minor anymore.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I must confess that I was little noughty when I was writting this &gt; Actualy, I was hoping that the discusion will show that there is no single official <b><u>harmony</u></b> annotation but more than one, probably each having its inconsistencies.

Nothing new to me. In another post I outlined 4 or 5 different systems.

We already have a system for what you're proposing called Set Theory.

In essence, you're adding another RN system that's just going to confuse matters even further.

&gt;I proposed a new system in the eBook for learning musical <b><u>harmony</u></b>, here on reddit, but the first comment was that the eBook is not using the standard notation so it will not be helpful for people.

You're not the first, nor the last.

Most of the people who propose these are people who for some reason, refuse to learn music, and get frustrated with the existing system becuase they can't be bothered to learn it, so they spend huge amounts of energy trying to create some "better" system when a system that has worked for millions already exists. I'm not saying that's you, but since so many people are that way, it gets you thrown in with the bunch.

You may not know this, but there are a whole bunch of people who, for decades now, have been proposing new notation systems so there are essentially 12 letter names rather than 7, and a staff that puts each chromatic pitch on its own line and space.

The problems with this are:
1. We already have Set Theory for this.
2. Musicians have been trained in what is a long tradition - and are very slow to change and adopt new practices. So yes, a "new" system is going to be met with apathy in most cases. Now, that doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile venture, but you also have to understand that you or they are often proposing systems that don't need to be proposed in the first place because again, they didn't bother to learn the other systems well, or the existing system covers it pretty well. 

Here is an analysis of Palestrina. Notice they don't use Roman Numerals (direct link)

Why?

Here is an analysis of a Schoenberg Piece (direct link again):

https://edisciplinas.usp.br/mod/resource/view.php?id=143147

No Roman Numerals. Why?

Different styles need to have the elements that are different pointed out. You could go through the Palestrina and "name" the chords with Roman Numerals, and you could probably do the same with the Schoenberg - you might have some pretty wacky names but if a system is complete enough it could do it.

It might tell us that the two styles differ greatly, but it doesn't tell us anything about how the music is made - what makes it tick - one is Counterpoint and Modal, Common Practice music is Chordal and Tonal, the other god knows what and Atonal.

Just because pop/modern music admits the used of a diminished chord on b7, does not mean we need to analyze Palestrina, Mozart, or Schoenberg using that symbol.

But, by all means, you are absolutely free to write your book and promote your ideas. As long as you don't get too upset if you're met with constant arguments (some informed, some not-so-informed) because you likely will.

Good Luck in the endeavor though.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;For instance, when musical chords appear like the chromaticaly descending sequence of diminished triads, like near to the end of Bach's Prelude in d minor from WTC1

What we do for situations like this is simply not label the chords!

They're not really that important actually. IOW, something else is going on in musical passages like that.

One of the reasons CPP RNs are used as they are is that there are elements beyond "chords" in CPP music and just "naming chords" doesn't give you a picture of what else is going on.

For example, there are what we call "linear progressions" and there are also harmonies that are "resultant" of voice-leading (thus sometimes called voice-leading chords).

Those musical passages aren't "about" <b><u>harmony</u></b>, they're "about" something else more important. So in situations like that, we don't have Roman Numerals or other "chord-naming" symbology for things, or, we don't use existing symbology.

This helps to lessen the emphasis on "chordality" and put the focus on something else that's happening.

A real simple example are Non-Chord Tones. Non-Chord Tones behave in pretty specific and well-prescribed manners in CPP music and because of that it was felt important not to "subsume" them into the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

In Jazz (or pop) OTOH, that element of linearity has been subsumed into the verticality of <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

There's really no such thing as an 11th or 13th chord in CPP music. Even a lot of things you could call a 9th are hard to define as a chord or non-chord tone. There are no "sus4" chords. There are no "add 9" or even "6" chords (at least not until closer to the 20th century).

Instead, we name triads and 7th chords (and a few 9ths) and retain the distinction of those non-chord tones being linear elements rather than chordal ones.

What this means is, if we try to create a system that just focuses on "chord naming", we ignore and lose the importance of those other elements.

This is why the Palestrina example I linked to - though it's just one example, people don't generally analyze Renaissance and earlier music using Roman Numerals (except in a broad sense). They weren't functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the textures are highly contrapuntal and linear, and most harmonies are primarily resultant rather than structural, so approaching this music from a vertical perspective only gives you a very small percentage of the entire picture.

So the "analysis tools" are selected based on the style, to best describe things that are considered worth pointing out and maintaining conceptual distinctions.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"Church Modes" is maybe just a colloquial name for the 8 "Ecclesiastical Modes".

It may also loosely refer to modes in general (the 7 we have now) because people don't know about the EMs and just assume that these modern 7 are the ones used a long time ago.

1. Dorian
2. Phrygian
3. Lydian
4. Mixolydian
5. and a "hypo-" version of each of those for a total of 8.

I suppose it depends on how strict/pedantic you want to be. There's probably an argument that the modern modes are distinct entities from the ancient modes in much the same way we could distinguish Major from Ionian and Minor from Aeolian. There are probably cases where such distinctions are important, but for most general purposes we may not need to make such distinctions.

So, are there modern pop/jazz tunes that use Modes?

Absolutely.

**How** they use them might also be something we could talk about more pedantically if we wanted.

For example, "Oye Como Va" by Santana is "in the Dorian mode".

"Louie Louie" by The Kingsmen is in Mixolydian.

"Sweet Home Alabama" is in - wait - we don't dare go there...

"What I Like About You" is *mostly* in E Mixolydian - but the bridge/interlude before the solo is not.

"Eleanor Rigby" contains a melody line with a nod to Dorian over a static <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but soon continues in the primary key.

There's a whole genre of jazz called "Modal Jazz"

and people who use "Chord-Scale" theory/playing tend to approach note sets modally.

So we could question whether a Jazz player is "using a Church mode" or even more specifically, one of the 8 Ecclesiastical modes.

No one today really uses the Hypo- modes at all, because that's more of an implementation issue than raw data issue.

Ionian and Aeolian (and Locrian) and their Hypo- counterparts were not even recognized until a point where the 8 modes were sort of morphing into Major and Minor anyway. But Glareanus wrote a treatise called "Dodecachordon" - Dodeca- for 12 - that's the original 8 plus the newly-defined at the time Io and Aeo modes and their Hypo- twins. 8+4 = 12.

So when we use Dorian today, are we using a "Church mode"?

Well, the note set is the same. But we're probably not using it in the exact same way, or possibly in a remotely similar way.

A lot of modern pop music uses what is better described as Aeolian rather than Minor, but since it didn't originally exist as a Church mode, do those not count?

Furthermore, most modern use of modes is really within a quasi-tonal framework - IOW, they use a mode for note resources, but other wise treat everything else in the piece as if it were plain old Major/minor music (which is why the Aeolian thing works so well).

Jazz players can probably give you tons of examples of modes either as the basis for a piece, a section of a piece, or improvisation material.

I could probably dig up a number from rock - plenty of mixolydian and dorian especially - Phrygian is rare for a whole piece (outside of more experimental or obscure things - especially in metal) and Lydian is as well - Joe Satriani's piece is usually quoted. But again, it could be material for a melody or solo only, a section of a piece, or the entire piece.

So it depends on how strict you want to be about what you mean by Church mode and how it's implemented today.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's actually a common older cadence (which would have been the actual time that Plagal Cadences originated and were more commonplace) that goes like this:

G - G - G
F - D - E
C - C - C

You might now call it Csus4 - Csus2 - C

But the Csus4 - C resolution is common as well.

Really, in terms of a Plagal cadence historically, these wouldn't count because it would be a chord to a chord.

And back then, there was no such thing as a sus 4 chord. Instead, a chord could have a Non-Chord Tone of a suspended 4 that resolves to a chord tone of the following chord, so this is what we call a 4-3 Suspension.

The 4 is considered a dissonance and not part of the chord though.

Today, the same structure is considered a stand-alone chord on its own but, as such, it doesn't have to resolve - it can - and it sounds like the older 4-3 suspension (and obviously, the name for the chord came from that).

But as you noted - it's also a quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and additionally, in non-CPP contexts it could imply some type of incomplete IV chord (it would be Fadd9 since no 7th is present).

So it's "got a plagal vibe".

Is it truly a Plagal Cadence - not traditionally, no. But we've also extended those terms to include other similar-sounding progressions so taking it broadly, it would be in the "plagal family".

As far as the function of Sus chords, you've kind of hit the high points - traditionally based on a 4-3 suspension in need of resolution, so functions as a dissonance resolving to a consonance; as a quartal chord with no need for resolution; and as an incomplete chord that could be functional in some contexts.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Awesome! Firebird should be fun!!! (and challenging).

Have you checked out Petrushka? Nice trumpet part.

You're playing a "main melody" instrument, so you should have a good handle on melodies.

But I would say those broad, sweeping, Romantic melodies can be a little more difficult to suss out becuase they're on an expanded time scale.

Maybe it's time to just start grabbing melodies from other places and learn to play them on both your instruments - I'm thinking things like the Bach Two and Three Part Inventions (Inventions and Sinfonia), the melodies to things like Fur Elise (great chromatic right at the top!). A lot of the later Mozart Sonatas but really Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven - get the parts for the first Violin in those - Symphonies, String Quartets, Piano Trios, etc.

There's what some people call "essential" chromaticism and "unessential" (inessential) chromaticism.

I never liked those words because it makes one seem more important, but essentially it's functional, and decorative chromaticism.

Chromatic notes can be used in a melody simply to embellish any melodic tone. They can be chromatic passing tones, chromatic neighbors, and chromatic appoggiaturas (something that almost becomes a romantic period cliche).

Here's a great example of a lot of decorative chromaticism (not all, but most):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfKcFi_ou9U

Functional Chromaticism instead largely appears as "ti-do" to a note other than the tonic, or "fa-mi" to the 3rd of some other chord than the tonic (like a 7th resolving down).

So a Bb in C will appear on a I chord to turn it into V7/IV to resolve down to the A.

Likewise, an F# in C will appear on a "II" chord to turn it into V7/V and resolve up to the G - which is what happens here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnv1ZBBRBcc

So functional chromaticism tends to happen more in a harmonic context, and decorative chromaticism more in a melodic context.

FC is part of the chord (or the chord reflects the chromatic change). Here you see it used for secondary dominants and to modulate:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVULQVEsGIk

In Minor Keys, the 6th and 7th degrees kind of work slightly differently because they are sort of part of the key itself and thus diatonic. But, you can tell in the names of Harmonic and Melodic minor scales, what their purposes tend to be.

Horrible sounds, but you should be able to play it:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbIXDMGYHZ0

Learning melodies like this will kind of help you intuit how chromaticism is used (i.e., not just willy nilly!) and the more of it you play the better - and it's especially important to understand it in the context of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and other parts, so you need to start analyzing them as well.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Such a tough call because things are so subjective.

and so it appears, is your guy's theory.

It's hard to pick becuase there are plenty of dissonances throughout historical periods and in many cases out of context they sound odd, but are ok in the context of the piece. Even certain intervals, like a Minor 9th can sound really harsh and abrasive, but on a V7b9 chord become almost nothing shocking aside from a desire to resolve in a way that comes off as a "good dissonance" instead of a bad one.

So I think none of this does you any good with understanding the context in which they appear, and the "confines" of the time.

A very classic example is in Beethoven's 3rd symphony, movement 1, where the tonic <b><u>harmony</u></b> is used against the dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

It's about 8:40 in this clip:

https://youtu.be/dEJGR1ICJ1I?t=8m29s

The horns were, at the premiere, though to have played wrong notes.

Now, at the time, this was a no-no (outside of for comedic effect, which this was not). 

At that time, such a <b><u>harmony</u></b> would sound "bad" on its own. In fact, it would sound "wrong" (and apparently did to some listeners).

Yet, in context, it "works".

Now, this again is tough, because we're listening to it centuries later so our ears have been exposed to far "worse" sounds. So now we think of this as one of the most awesome musical events in history - pre-dating by years what was to come in the 20th century with Bi-Tonality.

Honestly, I think you're biting off more than you can chew as it's both so subjective and that subjectivity changes over time.

Maybe I would suggest a different approach since he uses the words "morals" - take that to mean "rules" because from what you've said, "breaking the rules" can only sound bad.

But if you take someone like Debussy - take something like Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun or The Sunken Cathedral - these "break all the rules" but are still quite nice pieces. They take the "ugly" "immoral" combinations of chords and make something sonorous from them.

But I don't know how important time is here - for example, something that was unacceptable at first but then became acceptable (which happens all of the time). Does that negate or support? If morals change, that has to be taken into account.

Wine is made from rotten grapes, which go through terribly unappealing stages to get to the wine, so...


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>What?

Forget all this nonsense.

If you want music to sound Phrygian, you use the Phrygian mode for both your melodies and your harmonies.

In particular, you want to emphasize the bII chord because that's what makes Phrygian unique from regular minor.

It's true that Phrygian is the intervallic mirror of Ionian, but it's king of going around your A$$ to get to your elbow if you're trying to come at it from inverting all kinds of stuff.

Look at it this way:

Go Down a C Scale - C B A G F E D C all over a C Major chord.

Invert the intervals in each you get C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C over a Cm chord 

Now, alternatively, you could invert the chord from the root rather than "in place" more like the scale.

This will give you an Fm chord.

However, if you play "C Phrygian" over an Fm, you're jut going to get an Fm scale *in relation to the <b><u>harmony</u></b>*

So always, your melody - no matter what mode it's in - is dependent on the <b><u>harmony</u></b> if <b><u>harmony</u></b> is present.

If your <b><u>harmony</u></b> is screaming C Major, you can play E to E on top of it all day long and it's still going to sound like C Major.

C Phrygian over an Fm chord is just going to sound like Fm.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, *you* think it worked, but maybe others didn't?!?!? ;-)

**Eb - Bb** - F - C - **G - D** - A - E

Notice that in a quintal stack, the F/C dyad is skipped and you get the G/D dyad for the full EbM7 chord. If you think about Eb Lydian, you're getting all 7 notes up to the A right?

So harmonically, you're not too far from stacking one more 5th, going to what is essentially Bb Lydian (which yes, would raise the Eb to E as you said). And just think if the next chord was an FMaj7!

I was working with some quintal stacks recently and there's a "logic" about stacking 5ths that makes these "wrong" notes sound "right" - as if they are just bound by the logic of continual stacking in a way that makes them acceptable.

But, I would say it would either need to be out of context, or, when appearing in a piece, in a context where the quartal sound is heavily reinforced throughout the piece.

Otherwise I think you're going to pretty much hearing it as some kind of passing tone (which is even when you think about Bop scales, where the additional chromatics come from)

But another thought is that when EbM7 appears in a song, it's not necessarily in the key of Eb. It could be a IV (which puts us back to Bb Lydian if you're using that over I) but it could just be a nice sounding chord in a context where you get a string of Maj7s - like the FMaj7 mentioned above - so the E could be part of the over-riding key and not just a note tied to this particular <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Key can often over-ride a single chord in many contexts.

It's also b5 - a blue note - in Bb, so if it's a Bb Blues, it could easily work over the IV chord, though it would typically be 7 not M7, but sometimes the sound is familiar enough that it works in context.

If the key were Eb, it's not really a borrowed note from the parallel minor, but b2 does have that kind of idea and of course b9 are common enough on altered scales - again typically a dominant but you know, once you get use to that kind of sound in the right context it can still sound OK.

There's an old instrumental by The Shadows called "Apache" and it does this 5 to b6 move in the melody that people often ask about where it's a note borrowed from the parallel minor - it's less common to do a single note rather than a whole <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and it sounds kind of funny over the major I chord - but it's a sound you actually hear in some space music and even Brahms - sort of like I and I+ - so b2 can have a similar quality.

Remember also that replacing the Eb with E gives you an Em7b5 sound or a Gm6 - so it also could be that you heard something that turned it into more of a Gm sound with the added 6 which is pretty palatable or again, even though not a dominant, something that gave you another familiar sound like a 7#9 (but Maj7#9).

So could be a number of possible explanations - but I think your "circle of 5ths" falls in line with stacking 5ths and quartal harmonies, so you probably mentally accepted that inner logic of it just being a continuation of sounds that were already happening.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>FWIW, I'm a guitarist and I talk to a lot of guitarists - and they - especially it seems - think that "theory" is some magic bullet that's going to make them better players.

The vast majority of musicians out there in popular music styles aren't "trained". Most of them might have some basics, like you. But they are largely self-taught. And they are self-taught by learning to play songs and recreate the ideas.

They know "theory" in the sense that they learn what they need to make what they want. Often they don't know the correct terminology for it, but they get the idea of things like chord formulas, or some basic scales, and so on.

Now of course, Bill Evans is an entirely different ball game.

But most of these people are just putting together things that "sound good" to them.

But trying to read about it how to do it, or doing it in isolation doesn't really teach you anything - and you don't know when what you're doing is right or not.

At some point it's super helpful to work with some other musicians if you can. I suppose Videos and Books and Websites are all good **supplements** but they're no substitute for direct feedback. I realize you can get that online too, but I feel like you end up wasting a lot of time running in circles with arguments like "no, this is major becuase it doesn't have a dark feel" - already you were confused with the whole modes thing (at least it seems that way at the beginning of the post).

So an instructor can start you with the things you need to know *in a logical order*.

Also, don't get stuck on a song. You like a song but you can't figure it out? Well, try a different song - there are bazillions out there.

There are so many sound effects in EDM they can obscure the underlying <b><u>harmony</u></b> a lot of times. So maybe try to find songs that sound simpler, and work them out. After a while you'll get an idea of things that are more easy to figure out, and you can spend more time on those, then move towards things that challenge you a little more.

Just like, you don't want to start playing Bill Evans's hardest works - you want to start with Jazz Standards like Autumn Leaves or something, and get the basics first.

You need Chord Progressions and Melody. Keys and Scales. Major and Minor Chords. What notes go with which chords and are in which key.

That's where all this begins.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Kostka/Payne define a Phrase as a "complete" musical idea that is terminated by a cadence.

From that standpoint the Blue is an Antecedent/Consequent pair of phrases, which itself forms a Period (Red).

Since the two phrases begin similarly, it'd be called a Parallel Period.

The Em - Ebm serves as a form of half cadence for the Antecedent Phrase.

The first two green boxes are called Motives, and obviously that makes up the beginning idea of the 3rd green box.

Sometimes, the green boxes are called "sub-phrases" but in this case, whether those initial two motives count as merely an "introduction" to the first sub-phrase (like "false-starts") or as part of that phrase itself may be open for interpretation.

I've noticed many are "looser" with their definitions and "scale up" or "scale down" the levels from what I just described, often not considering cadences. 

But I feel like their definition is more typical of at least CPP music.

But I can draw a parallel with pop music:

Nibblin on sponge cake
Watching the sun bake
all of those tourists covered in oil.

A lot of people might call the first to lines phrases, or if laid out as one line with an internal rhyme would call that one phrase together. But musically speaking, it doesn't finish the phrase until "oil" where the chord finally changes (making it a half cadence). Up until then it's just been one chord.

While your example changes <b><u>harmony</u></b>, there doesn't seem to be any solid cadence until either the Em - Ebm - or the ii - V, or possibly an elision with the I of the next phrase. At any rate, any of those compared to the next phrase, which ends with an authentic (stronger) cadence with the Tonic in the melody (also stronger - not the first phrase ends on G) makes this a "phrase terminated by weak cadence" followed by "phrase followed by a stronger cadence", thus A/C construction and thus a Period. Those are all "sub-phrases", some of which are just a motive itself.


HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Phew man, I could barely get through it!

It's all those quarter note block chords!!!

You only let up two times - and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you may not have let up on them becuase you felt they needed to be let up on, but because the RH has quarter note triplets and playing the 2 against 3 can be tricky for many...

OK, so I could be wrong. But really, it just gets to be battery after a while - especially at this tempo!

The piano sound doesn't help I suppose.

But seriously, I do think you need some "change" in the parts.

Hard to read but I think it's "but we're here" that ends the phrase in measure 8.

By that point, I wanted to hear that quarter note block chords broken up - if not a quarter note arpeggio, maybe an 8th note arpeggio.

Or you could borrow some motive from the melody and play it as an "echo" in the chords.

in fact, I really like the melodic motive that begins the next phrase "Frozen to the bone" - maybe you could "prequel" that in the chordal part or something.

Accompanying measure 9 on with 8th notes in the piano - broken chords, arpeggios, rhythmic chords, anything but 4 on the floor block chords again!

That melody almost needs something "sweeping", not "stabbing" under it.

You've got an A B A B thing happening with the phrases - accompany the B part differently.

Put some "drum fills" (melodic interest in the piano part that "set up" the next section) between sections.

I would actually accompany that quarter note triplet maybe with even the same rhythm in the chordal part - it would make more sense if the B section is "busier" because that would provide relief without the motion coming to a dead halt.

Again, I might consider the measure that transitions back to the beginning idea (m. 14 it looks like) to have a quarter note triplet to "echo" the previous measure on beats 1 and 2, then on beats 3 and 4 start the quarter note motion again - this will make a nice transition out of one section and back into the B material (but if you did that, the chord pauses in the previous measure may make more sense).

It's kind of an unusual way to accompany a voice - I mean, you could easily have the piano play the chords in the RH and play the bass notes in the LH, and a singer sing the song (or melody instrument play it) rather than the piano RH duplicating what the voice is doing. But if a singer sings it, doubling it all the way through with the piano might get tiring as well.

So it's like you've got "Voice - Chords - Bass" - Three instruments, that should be "Voice - Guitar - Bass" or something - IOW, the piano kind of seems to be doing just one thing - the chords - even though it has the melody, the voice is already doing it.

So you might consider the RH of the piano just taking the chords while the voice is going, and then, the LH of the piano doubling the Bass part.

Then the piano can pick up the melody/improvy section at m. 17/18 - where it sort of takes the place of the voice as a different instrumentation.

Things like this happen, but it's like the bass is just there becuase you didn't give it to the piano, but if the piano did it, the bass wouldn't be needed, because the voice can take the melody. So if you're going to use the piano like this, it might be more interesting for it to "trade off" - sometimes double the melody, sometimes double the bass, always playing the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (but not those block chords all the way through!!!).

This will add even more interest.

My opinion, just some random dude on the internet. So don't be offended, take it as it was meant -  constructive criticism.

I always say, if I mention something that you might have also gone "you now, I was thinking the same thing", then that's probably a good indication that maybe something is worth re-considering.

If not, cool, enjoy.

Cheers


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's all about Function.

In Jazz, vi and iii when "added to" a I chord, don't really alter its function - you can think of it as making a IMaj7 chord and I6 chord. So when these sounds appear on their own as substitutes, they don't have much effect and are considered "Tonic" function.

V on the other hand is typically a Dominant Function.

Now, you could "add" iii to it to make a V6, but a V7 is a much stronger dominant - so the iii in this case kind of "calms" the V chord whereas the addition of the viio turns it into V7.

Part of this has to do with the tritone, part of it with the [functional] leading tone, and part of it has to do with other dissonances (such as a viio7 which "adds" the b9 to a V chord).

So iii on its own has much more "Tonic-ness" than "Dominant-ness".

The more important "shared" notes for Dominant chords (triads) are 2 and 7 - because those "collapse" around 1.

Taking that logic, if you see those two "preparing" the Tonic - those are Dominant chords.

To prepare the Dominant, you'd need notes above and below scale degree 5 - and those are 4 and 6 (not 2 and 4). So it's the ii and IV chord that have Dominant Prep qualities.

But a lot of this comes from a long-standing tradition of Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> (and even things that pre-date it) so the Function of V and viio were well-established long before the idea of substitutions come along.


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Yeah - I only looked at the embedded player - thanks for the explanation - that does make the what I called "weird" instrumentation more logical.

The composition is great, but I seriously can't abide by those repeated block chords throughout. If things are going to be written out I'd seriously consider changing it. If it's to be more improvisatory, you should just give the changes. If you want that rhythm, but improvised voices, you could give the first measure rhythm and use something like "slash notation" with the chords to give the player an idea of what you want in the first measure, which they'll just continue to do.

In some ways, it sounds like what you really want is a Lead Sheet - not something written out like this - IOW, it's kind of either too much notation, or not enough depending on which way you wanted to take it.

But the melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> is nice, as is the form so well done with all that!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>
Most people don't know what they're talking about...but get a go pro and internet access and there you go.

There are two things:

1. Mode Mixture

2. Modal Interchange

Mode Mixture is using harmonies (primarily) from the Parallel "mode" - here the word mode means "type" - i.e. Major or Minor key. So using chords from the key of C Minor while in the key of C Major is an example of Mode Mixture. We also call these "borrowed chords" or similar names.

It's important to understand that traditionally, and entire <b><u>harmony</u></b> is borrowed - so for example, you didn't typically borrow just Eb to turn your C Major 7 chord into a CmM7, because that chord itself didn't exist in the minor mode.

Modal Interchange is, TMK, a Jazz term. I've never seen any specific definition but IME it's a similar principle which incorporates and expands upon the concept of Mode Mixture.

However, it uses both harmonies and notes, and really, it probably more uses notes to create harmonies that wouldn't exist in the mode being borrowed from necessarily.

So, for example, in the key of C, when you encounter an F#, or use a CMaj7#11, you're "borrowing" that F# from the C Lydian Mode.

In a sense, this opens up all the modes for potential borrowing, not just parallel "modes" (Keys) of Major and Minor, but parallel modes of C Ionian, C Aeolian, C Phrygian, C Lydian, and the like.

My first recommendation is to spend 8 hours playing songs on an instrument rather than watching videos.

When you come across something you don't understand, look it up and figure it out - ask a question here.

Mode Mixture is ubiquitous in pop/rock, especially blues-based "classic rock".

Most people come across that same old question "I'm playing in C Major, where does this Eb chord come from?"

That's Mode Mixture. And really, that's all it is. It's just a name for something that happens.

Modal Interchange is more the Jazz world and can refer to improvistory material as well as harmonies (like playing Lydian over a Maj7 chord).

FWIW, most people don't study "academic" music theory so "Mode Mixture" is not a term you're going to hear as much. But there are cases where the distinction can be important.

If you want to "compose" using things like this, you first need to gain tons of experience playing them.

As jongtr said:

Most of the more "texty" textbooks are criminally expensive.

You should actually use as many resources as you can find OP, so the links down on the sidebar here are a good place to start.

IIRC, the <b><u>Harmony</u></b> texts by Piston and Schoenberg aren't too expensive anymore.

You might be able to pick up good deals on used ones on the following <b><u>Harmony</u></b> texts (various titles, I'm listing the authors):

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No. Has nothing to do with that.

Retrograde simply means "backwards" or "backwards presentation".

It's usually used in connection with melodies (or fuque motives, etc.) and in Serial Composition, with 12-Tone rows (or rows in general).

If a line is:

C - D - E - F - G

The retrograde is:

G - F - E - D - C

Someone might use the term instead or "retrogression" which is the opposite of "progression".

We use the word "progression" broadly to just mean a *succession* of chords, but we also use it specifically to mean when the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is "progressing towards a goal".

A "retrograde" progression (or retrogression) would imply that the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is leading AWAY from the goal.

So  progression like

vi - ii - V - I

is considered to be progressing towards the tonic (thus functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>)

and

I - V - IV - vi

would be considered as "retrogressing" (or simply not progression, and thus non-functional as well) as it "leads away" from the tonic.

So it could have been used in that context but that's not really the most common (nor potentially, accurate) use of the term.

More commonly it refers to something you hear going forwards first, then is "retrograded" or "the retrograde enters" etc., which is the presentation of the same material in reverse.

So mostly for melodies (rows, motives, subjects, melodies, etc.) and rarely for harmonies.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Naming chords can be tricky, and giving a chord a name like this doesn't actually tell a person exactly what notes or voicing to play. A chord name is really just a "suggestion of <b><u>harmony</u></b>" at this point.

One issue with the notes you've give are whether the "5th" is G# or Ab.

Caug#11 means this:


C - E - G# - Bb - F#

You didn't put F# though.

However, the whole "aug" thing is a getting to be a little outdated in favor of clearer notation with higher tensions. For example, what you have:

C - E - G# - Bb - F would be a "Caug11"

But, "aug 11" could also be interpreted by some as #11.

So you'll very often see "#5" used now instead of "aug" in the name.

C-E-G#-Bb is simply a C7#5

To extend the principle:

C11#5 means:

C - E - G# - Bb - (D) - F

The D would be optional.

It is possible that the Ab is a b13 and the 5th is omitted (which would be in standard practice).

C - E - [G] - Bb - (D) - (F) - Ab

C7b13 or C7(b13) - both clearer than Cb13 because it might look like "C-flat" as the root.

But essentially, the only way to guarantee that the "Ab" is present is to call it G# which can be "required" by including #5 in the symbol, and the F can be "required" by the 11.

11 implies the 7th must be present, but it means the 9th could be optionally included as well.

C11#5 would get you:

C - E - G# - Bb - D? - F

So someone might or might not play the D.

You could improperly use "add":

C7#5(add11) and people would get what you mean, but that's not the way "add" is supposed to work.

The naming system for <b><u>harmony</u></b> doesn't really name chords for what they are. It names them for what they would be if all their notes were present.

So C-E-Bb and C-G-Bb can both be called C7. In some contexts we can even call C-Bb C7.

So the chord "should be" named as if it had the D. But people seem to want to try to name a chord to tell you the voicing as well, which is not really what the system was designed to do, and players won't even interpret them that way so it's kind of pointless in many cases.

Finally, this all assumes a C root.

This could just as easily be:

F - Ab - C - E - (G) - Bb

An FmM7 with an 11 added.

It could even be:

Bb - (D) - F - Ab - C - E which just makes it a Bb9(#11) (or Bb7(#11) or even Bb#11)

There are loads of classical era pieces that end with just the Root of the chord 3 times, and the 3rd - no 5th. These chords are called "I" or in the key of C it would be a "C" chord.

IOW, "incomplete" chords are still named for what they'd be if they were complete.

So it doesn't happen with only extended chords. But simply put, missing notes were not originally intended to impact the name of the chord.

We have done it in some cases in this trend to try to provide voicing through chord name, but the system as is is inadequate for that purpose without a lot of modification which tends to happen only when it becomes widespread and catches on, which hasn't seemed to happen despite the apparent need.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>&gt; Edit: You made me curious, so I looked at some harp music and I can see that the texture is all wrong. I guess I could double the notes on a bass staff for all the non-chords at very least. It's pretty obvious looking back at my composition that I kind of had a singer's mindset. Plus, the music we analyzed in college was piano music, songs for voice and piano, and full orchestral scores, so I guess I don't know a lot about smaller stuff that isn't just voice and piano.


Good. That's what I was trying to teach you :-)

I know you have chords in the "upper" part, but why not consider making it just a single note melody for another instrument, such as Flute, or Violin, etc.

You'll have to check the range for those instruments of course.

There are "Celtic Harps" and Diatonic Harps that aren't Pedal Harps (like Orchestral ones) that are more often called on to play things like you've asked for, but honestly even a concert harp doesn't pair well with a modern piano because the piano can so easily overpower it.

IOW, what I'd encourage you to do is look at how Harp is often used - it, like Piano and Guitar, and sometimes Organ or other keyboard instruments, often takes on the role of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and accompanimental instrument in a texture like this.

Meaning, it could be Piano and Flute, or Harp and Flute, or Guitar and Flute, and so on.

But using the Harp as a solo instrument over the piano, especially with so much single line stuff is atypical.

That doesn't mean it's impossible or wrong of course.

However, writing for Harp takes a good working knowledge of the instrument - maybe more so than many others. It can do a lot of what Piano does, but there are certain restrictions with regard to what notes it can play and so on.

Someone asked about writing for Harp and my response was "don't do it - run away".

I was half joking - but half not - it's not for the "beginner" or "amateur".

It's something you want to research a little more than say, Piano, which while having its own restrictions, can do a lot more.

Furthermore, most of us have access to some kind of keyboard instrument and can make sure things like chords aren't out of reach, but we don't usually have the same access to a Harp.

I would like to give you some philosophical ramblings if you care to read on:

A lot of people write music for "instrument sounds" and not actual instruments.

That's OK I suppose, but it actually kind of makes me sad because people will plop notes down in a computer with no regard as to whether the music is actually playable on an instrument or not. IOW, you wrote a piece for "Piano Sound and Harp Sound", not a Piano and Harp duet.

And the sad thing to me about that is that people who do this never learn to get any better as composers.

So part of the reason I asked those questions was in the hopes that you would get curious and kind of look things up and maybe come to the conclusion that there's more to it than just "picking a sound".

I don't have a problem with it, but I'd almost wish people would pick a synthetic sound rather than a traditional instrument sound.

The other question I asked - about what other music have you looked at - I've noticed since joining here that not only do many compose for sounds with no knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of real instruments, they've never even really listened to any music for those instruments or studied any scores and so on.

They too seem to be just putting notes together in some way that maybe for them, they think sounds like "real" music, or that they don't realize sounds atypical, or that is sort of half-remembered things they've heard before.

But there are zillions of compositions already out there that are very astute. If you use those as a model and try to emulate them, you'll get better at composing. I worry about people who throw some notes down, post on a site, and everyone goes "congratulations, sounds great" - they'll never really get any better because they don't have any context to work within and standards to try and meet.

So my suggestion is that, if you were going to write say, a Flute and Piano Duet, then listen to and study a lot of Flute and Piano Duets - to get an idea of the forms, how the instruments interact, roles they play, limitations and capabilities, and so on.

Absolutely keep doing what you're doing, and experiment with sounds and textures to get inspiration and to practice working out ideas! That's all good stuff!!! So the work you've done here is great for that and great for learning.

But I really recommend using some existing pieces as "models" that you try and see if you can recreate something similar - doesn't have to be exact or anything, but it gives you a standard to rise to.

Best
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Music evolved like this:

First there was melody - melodic lines.

Then, a 2nd melody was added to the first melody.

This created "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>".

As time went on, more melodies were combined to produce larger chords (I'm vastly oversimplifying here but to make it easy to understand).

At some point, the simultaneous notes in each melody became important entities on their own - a "chord".

So a melody that goes:

E - D - C

and a melody that goes:

G - F - E

and a melody that goes:

C - G - C

at the same time produce 3 vertical structures as well:

C-G-E (a C chord) - G - F - D (a G7 chord) and C - E - C (a C Chord - again this is oversimplified).

There are some styles where it's more about multiple melody lines - we call this polyphony and usually refer to it as "counterpoint". In some cases the <b><u>harmony</u></b> can just be simply a result of the interaction of the melodies.

But there are more "chordal" styles of writing where it's all about "chords" and there are only the slightest remnants of any melodic motion between parts.

And there's a lot of grey area in between - things like Chorales are mostly chordal, but still retain a high degree of melodic motion in each part.

And when you give such parts to a Singer, they're going to sing a single note of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> on each note, and continue on to their next note - so they see each "line" they sing as a melody or melodic line.

It becomes less clear when a double bass plays a C on measure 1, waits 3 bars, and then plays an F then waits some more and plays a G.

So melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> are two distinct things, but more than one melody at the same time produces <b><u>harmony</u></b> in the same way that more than one note at the same time produces <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It's just that when melodies do this there's a strong degree of linearity - of "horizontal" motion that creates the harmonies, but when it's just notes outside of a melody doing it, we tend to see them more as "chords" whose notes aren't necessarily connected linearly to a note in the next chord - so a more "vertical" way of thinking.

What most people don't understand about music is that it's not all "chordal" and this is a concept they never quite get. So it's great you're figuring it out!



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hmm. I'm not sure how to answer your example.

F Lydian is not C Major.

It has the same notes as C Major, but it's not C Major.

It's kind of like, the chord A-C-E-G is Am7, but the chord C-E-G-A (in certain contexts) is C6 - same notes, different chord.

Why? Because we're trying to point out an aural distinction or important distinction or historical distinction etc. with the name.

Traditionally speaking, Modes were based on a set of notes with a particular "Tonus Primus" - which simply means "first note" but it was the lowest pitch of the mode.

Over time, we ascribed certain things to this note, like once we got to Tonality and key-based thinking, we named scales (and chords eventually) after their lowest sounding note or "first note" or Key Note or Tonic.

So F Lydian really has nothing to do with C, and everything to do with F - it's the aural center of the music.

So we point this out by calling it "F something" rather than "C something".

Historically, we've done the same with Major and Minor - C Major and A minor have the same notes, but we call them two different things because that difference is important (because it's pretty clear in written music that they operate as two distinct things).

If you take the set of notes that makes "C Major", and you treat an Ab as the tonic, you're really playing "Ab something or other".

Now, OK, yes, if you play a melody in C Major over an Ab bass note, it's going to create some sense of bi-tonality or at least modern <b><u>harmony</u></b> - and these things have been done.

Some people even called it "wrong note <b><u>harmony</u></b>" where what was otherwise "normal" music had these "wrong" notes inserted in a seemingly random fashion.

In the first half of the 20th century, between the wars in the US, it was a trend amongst composers to take American Folk Melodies and harmonize them "wrong" and often it was intentionally bi-tonal or notes that would definitively not belong to the melody's key.

But because we're so steeped in the Major Minor tradition (and to some degree modes), most people aren't going to describe these as some new "extended mode" or something - they'll either take it as some Octatonic Scale:

Ab - A - B - C - D - E - F - G - Ab

or - if the music is written this way - some "known and named" thing like a mode or scale, against some other named or known thing (a drone, a pedal, bi-tonality if the other part represents its own distinct key and so on).

I see your point about naturally extending the 7 note set - so many see a Pentatonic scale as "stacked 5ths" that ends with 5 notes and a traditional 7 note scale as stacked 5ths that ends with 7 notes. Why not keep stacking 5ths until you get all 12 notes? Or more - you can theoretically go on infinitely with tuning variations and never "close" the system at the octave

But why not use a 4 note set, or a 6 note set, or an 8 note set of scales formed from stacked 5ths? There's no reason not to and it's one principle that can be used (and has been used) to create pitch resources for composers to write music with.

However, when they do, they generally don't see this arbitrary 7 note entity with its historical baggage as some important cut-off point to which they've just stacked one more 5th - unless they're specifically using it in that way as a structural element of the music.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Do you mean singing a <b><u>harmony</u></b> note to an existing melody?

I've met people who are natural harmonizers but there are many like me who have to work at it.

Do you know your notes and chords? Do you know if you're singing the root, 5th 3rd or 7th of a chord?

What existing harmonies can you sing - for example, can you sing the <b><u>harmony</u></b> line that maybe Paul McCartney does to John Lennon's part in a Beatles song?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;which are ridiculously complicated for how simple the chord really is. The way I see it is as a quartal (fourths-based) chord in a particular inversion. The B on top can be brought down to revert the chord to it's base inversion; B E A D G. So why do we try to analyze a simple chord with complicated symbols?

Exactly.

Em11 works perfectly.

Here is the issue for me: you're trying to use a symbol to spell out particular voicings. We don't even do that with tertian-based <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I mean think of it this way - do we need a different symbology for C-E-G (3rds) versus C-G-E (6ths)?

We already have it - notes. They tell you EXACTLY what to play.

IMHO, quartal *voicings* are different than quartal *<b><u>harmony</u></b>* and a chord voiced in 4ths should get no more special treatment than a chord voiced in 3rds or 6ths. In fact, we don't give the others special treatment.

Chord symbols simply don't show voicing.

A lot of people think they should (or do...) and I can see benefits to that argument. But, at some point it gets complex enough that you might as well write out the notes.

My 2 cents.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK,

Firstly, Pentatonic Scales are - for most intents and purposes - never used as Harmonic Foundations.

That is to say, most of the time, the Pentatonic Scale (let's assume Major) is treated merely as a **subset** of the diatonic collective and used almost exclusively as a *melodic* resource, not a harmonic one.

Secondly, "Tonicization" by its very definition implies a harmonic construct. That means, even if, in the key of C, we see an F# that operates functionally as a leading tone to G, that entire concept is coming from a harmonic construct - the **key** - in this case a secondary key.

And we might be able to say it comes from just the leading tone of another key, the evolution is more so a harmonic one (that is, leading tones developed in tandem with <b><u>harmony</u></b>).

So the two are to some degree inextricably intertwined.

Thirdly, even if we were to allow a LT in a non-harmonic context to act as such to some tone in a Major scale, you probably are aware that that note in most cases (all except 1 actually) must come from outside the key - a note "not in the scale".

So if we were going to extend the principle to a 5 note set, it should impact nothing. If we want to "tonicize" the D note in C Maj Pent, we'd still use a note from a secondary key - C#. It matters not that were not using all 7 notes - all that does is mean we can't harmonize F or B since they're not present (and we couldn't harmonize B before anyway, and F uses the LT diatonic to the key anyway, so it's doubtful it would operate as a functional secondary even in a 7 note set!).
___________________

Essentially what all this means is, if we treat the Pent as a 5 note subset of the diatonic collective as a melodic resource, nothing's changed.

___________________

Where something would change would be if we were to use the Pent as a HARMONIC resource as well.

So as you know, we'd have C-E-A, D-G-C, E-A-D and so on as potential harmonies.

But one then needs to ask:

If we're going to use a non-diatonic system to generate <b><u>harmony</u></b> why would we do so? Surely one potential reason would be to create a different harmonic complex that presents different options for making sounds.

Why then, should we arbitrarily slap all this other "tonal baggage" on it?

We're not dealing with the concept of "Key" in the strict sense anymore, so why apply ideas like "Tonicization" to it?

In fact, one could argue that Tonicization is part of the Tonal system, and once you're not using Tonality anymore, you can't possibly have Tonicization.

Now, we could of course develop similar principles.

So, let's say we want to "Pentacize" the note G in "C Pent".

Well, what makes C pent C pent? Lack of B and F (and the other 5 chromatic notes).

So what would make it both not C Pent, and something else that's not anything else? (the answer for Tonal music there BTW is the tritone of course).

Every Major pent begins with 1-2-3 and that is not duplicated elsewhere.

So by using G-A-B you'd have the necessary ingredients to make it G, not C.

And let's assume that you play enough melodic cadences in your piece such that cadences go 3-2-1.

So if your melody is C Pent, it you want to move to G pent (or anything else), you need to introduce the 3-2-1 of that note.

Now, whether you want to maintain the tradition of only being able to "Pentacize" notes present in the original scale as we do with Hepta- scales, that's fine.

Let's say insted your cadence was G-A-C. So the problem there is that there's also D-E-G already in the scale.

This is not unlike trying to tonicize IV with only the I chord, which already exists in the key. You have to add the b7 to the I chord to make it clearly V7/IV as opposed to just a I. So an additional element needs to be introduced.

To "pentacize" the note G, we can't use just D-E-G if that's our primary identifier for establishing "Pental Centers" (which while not a unique note set, it could be "promoted" to the more important one by virtue of where it appears - cadences for example) - we'd probably need to harmonize that with its own "tritone" which again would likely be the 1-2-3 notes (or some other unique combination).

______________________

So it is possible to apply principles from Tonal music to "Pental Only" music, including monophonic pental music, but, the number of unique identifiers for any given Pent would be more limited (since there are fewer notes and we're not drawing from harmonic principles) and possibly even more limited depending on if you were willing to consider only "pentacizing" note in the original scale.

______________________

You might be able to set up other principles with harmonic structures but for either the one issue we run into is that Pentatonic music is often so closely tied to Tonality and diatonic scales that this "subset" concept is really overwhelming - even if we try to write a pentatonic melody, we often can't help but hear an implied <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Obviously this is even more of a problem when we're using the pent subset for melodic notes in a fully diatonic context anyway.

So most of the time, if we want to use the Pents as a resource, we'd be doing so with the intention to stay as far away from diatonic music as possible - thus adapting elements from that to use in Pental music seems a bit in the wrong direction.

Could work, no doubt, but the two could possibly be at odds as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;And, your point on how we voice chords in tertian-based <b><u>harmony</u></b>, maybe we should have some system for defining what the exact voicings are as well. I don't foresee quartal voicing notation and tertian voicing notation like such in the near future, but we can hope to get more specific.

&gt;It does raise a point, though, that we do technically have a system for defining what notes are played exactly, I can't recall the name exactly but I believe it uses numbers to say how notes are placed in a chord, much like how we can use 1 3 5 b7 to voice a dominant seventh chord, but it is a lot more specific than that.

That is my point. If you want a system for quartal voicings, fine, but really, you need it for all voicings. You may be thinking of Figured Bass for the other. But as I said, when you get to this point, you might as well just notate things.

IOW, you mention "proper" symbols. But the "proper" way to use symbols is not to specify voicing - tertian or otherwise. Just because the chord is quartally voiced doesn't mean we should treat these any differently. When we put "C9" the player may leave out the G. They may leave out the C as well if someone else has it. And they may play Gm, Em7b5, F#9 or some other substitute. It's Jazz. They're "suggestions" not specific.

I doubt at this point anyone capable of playing So What hasn't heard So What, and I would also assume the melody note would be written. So even if they get Em11 and the proper melody note, they'd probably voice 4ths if they know the tune and the right melody note would be on top anyway.

But again, Jazz players just sometimes accompany.

In a sense - Jazz people (and pop people) need to get over this idea that chord symbols should notate everything specifically becuase that's actually counter to their intent (Figured Bass is actually similar). We use notes for specific notation.

So What has this "mythology" around it and so does "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" (really quartal voicings) so naturally "playing it your own way" seems to be more taboo than "I Got Rhythm".

I think all you really need is something like Em11(q) or Cm7sus4(q) to tell people it is, or you'd like it to be a Quartally voiced chord.



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You should listen to, and actually learn to play, real music by real people.

Information from videos and sites can certainly *supplement* this, but I wouldn't take information from one video to be the gospel.

This is a tough subject.

The way most people write today in popular music is to come up with a chord progression first then put a melody to that.

But way back when, composers started with a melody first then "harmonized" it with chords.

Now, there's a bit of an oversimplification here because when someone like Mozart came up with a melody, he also intuitively understood which harmonies he would likely use to accompany it so the two were actually conceived simultaneously.

Good melody writers have usually listened to enough and played enough and analyzed enough music that they have an innate sense of <b><u>harmony</u></b> or "how melodies usually go" even if they're not conceiving of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> at the same time.

But what this means is, people are more likely to come up with melodies that follow traditional harmonic moves without necessarily realizing it - IOW, if it "sounds good" to them, it's probably becuase it's following all the typical moves.

So for example, if your melody begins F-A-C - that outlines an F Major chord, which is going to imply that <b><u>harmony</u></b>. So your root note is the note the chord is named for, in this case F.

If your melody goes G-A-B-C-D - the G-B-D part outlines a G Major chord. So again, it implies that <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and that's the <b><u>harmony</u></b> you'd probably put with it, and probably a G note in the bass.

But that's a really really simplistic overview.

Do you know your Keys and Scales and Chords? Because if not, that's what you need to learn.

Most people who come up with a melody want to determine what key it's in, so they know what chords (from what scale) to accompany it with.

Absolute best thing you can do is start learning to play music and analyze it while you learn it, and a lot of this stuff becomes self-explanatory.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm sorry. I can't help it. I'm just this way. I'm so sorry. I'm trying to hold myself back, but I can't.

Why would you use this book to learn music theory instead of, I don't know, a music theory book?

Ok, phew, I feel better now.

Ok, the last could just be a typo - they were working from one example while writing the book and the wrong example was included, or was changed etc. by the time it went to print. Happens all the time.

You're right:

A - E - A - E - A - C - E - A - C - E (or whatever) would have the Root Quadrupled, the 3rd Doubled, and the 5th Quadrupled.

The A is doubled at the octave, at the double octave, and the triple octave!

But I agree with octatonic formula - essentially this person is conflating part-writing with orchestration, both of which may contain doublings at the octave that are not "real parts".

For example, if you were to take a 4-part chord of Am for strings, you might get the following:

Vn I - A

Vn II - E

Va - C

Vc - A

CB - A


Now, the Violin I A is a "doubling" of the Root, but, it is a "real" part meaning it's an independent line.

But in this scenario (or what I'm doing for illustrative purposes) has the Contrabass "doubling" the A as well - however it is not a "real part" - it's just an "orchestral" doubling of the Cello part. It just rides along with the Cello an 8ve lower. This is common in strings as the Basses just read the Cello's part and they sound an octave lower. So it's not a 5th, independent part, but just an "octave reinforcement" of the Cello part (independent bass parts didn't happen until around Beethoven in the strings).

So while the root is "tripled" in that layout, it's kind of not really tripled. The "Bass" part (what the Cello has) is doubled at the octave. Then a separate thing is that the first Violins are doubling the root of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Agreed.

If your first note is D, it could be a Dm, Bb, or Gm chord if you want to stay in the key, as well as 7th chord versions or higher of those chords.

It could even be part of a iim7b5 which is still in the key.

Then you could go out of the key and have even more choices.

But yeah, a first note wouldn't necessarily imply any <b><u>harmony</u></b> on its own.

It's kind of like beginning a sentence:

"The..."

Not enough context to know what it's about yet!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, wait. Quick clarification:

Enharmonic equivalents are NOT consonances.

C to Eb is a 3rd, and thus a consonance, but C to D# is NOT a consonance.

I would also disagree about Pop. Pop treats dissonance a lot more like jazz or other contemporary music - more loosely than CPP  to varying extents.

Firstly, you have to understand that Consonance and Dissonance are *context-based* so in some cases an interval might be a consonance, but **treated** as if it were a dissonance, or, is a consonance in one context and a dissonance in another.

A great example is the Perfect 4th. In CPP music, when formed with the bass, it is treated as a dissonance. When formed between any other voices, it's treated as a consonance.

The same can be true of Jazz - in a blues-based tune you might get I6 for 3 measures and the 4th measure in a 12 bar might be a "I7" which works like a V7/IV. Usually we hear that 7th in that context as being introduced specifically for its dissonant character - or rather, it's being *treated* as a dissonance with the intent of resolving to the IV chord.

However, at the end of the piece you might get a "true" I7 without the need to resolve.

You might be interested in a book by James Tenney called something like The History of Consonance and Dissonance which IIRC was available online in PDF format.

Just to answer your query a little, as Western European <b><u>harmony</u></b> evolved, essentially more dissonance was accepted (or treated like consonances).

In initial Monophonic music, only doubling at the unison or octaves was allowed.

But, with the inception of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, 4ths and 5ths were the preferred consonance aside from the unison/8ve for the beginning and ending (considered even more perfect).

3rds and 6ths became acceptable soon after.

4ths have this dual role in the CPP era but other than that, things are what we usually understand.

However, as a point of interest, it's interesting how the 4th, which was consonant before, became dissonant in some contexts, and how parallel consonances, which were OK before, became not OK, except the 4th! You can't use parallel perfect consonances, but you can use parallel perfect 4ths when they're in their "consonant" arrangement!

These may seem incongruous, but they're holdovers from various styles that pre-dated CPP music.

CPP starts USING 9th chords and higher at the end, but it never accepts anything more than U/8, P5, and m/M 3/6 as consonances. Anything else is a dissonance or, in the case of the P4, depends on context.

20th century composers had their own concepts of consonance and dissonance and the way some wrote, you have to wonder if they simply accepted dissonance as consonance, or just treated them as such.

Hindemith did a bit thing on his thoughts.

Also, Helmholz and followers tried to *objectively* define dissonance.

I find all of that to be a little silly though, just like "tuning chasers".

It really doesn't matter if a Perfect 4th is consonant or dissonant *objectively*. It also doesn't matter if tuning one to a perfect ratio is "more in tune" than another.

it's THE MUSIC that makes the difference - it really doesn't matter if they're objectively consonant or dissonant, but **how they were treated** - thus even if an interval is objectively one, it may be treated as the other. That's why it's an art, not a science.

And don't forget - everyone talks about "intervals" but rarely do we encounter just intervals in music - so much is more complex harmonies.

Just for example, an Augmented triad should be wildly consonant as it's built of nothing but consonant intervals - major 3rds, minor 6ths.

Yet it's considered highly unstable.

Likewise, in Jazz you'll often hear about how the 3rd is dropped in 11th chords because it forms a m9 with the 11th (or the 11th is consequently raised). Similarly, Major 7th chords tend to avoid a voicing where the 7th forms a m9 with an upper part (especially the highest part).

But we're all about a 7b9 - sure it's a dissonance still, but we relish in that dissonance - because the other notes of the chord affect that interval differently.

And a simpler example of this is if you take a Major 7th, which can be pretty "stark" on its own, if you add a M3 and or P5 in between, it "softens" the chord and makes for a really nice sound, often treated as a quite stable sonority.

It's all about context - even within specific styles. That's the beauty of it.


</p></li><li><p><b>Learnmusic</b><br>Yeah, I agree with u/Korrun

Why would you want to use a book that's yet to be published or reviewed? There's already a ton of "standard" college level texts on Theory or <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

Walter Piston - <b><u>Harmony</u></b>

Kostka/Payne - Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>

Aldwell/Schachter - <b><u>Harmony</u></b>

Robert Gauldin - similar title

Arnold Schoenberg - similar title

Marvin/Clendenning - something like "Musicians' Guide to.."

It's helpful to read as many as possible to get different view points and approaches.

Most "texts" are prohibitively expensive, but things like the Schoenberg or Piston are usually cheaper.

I found the Piston to be very "readable" compared to others, which are often more:

Definition

Example

Application

That approach is good too though.

That gives you an idea at least of what they were thinking of it as.

You know, it doesn't really matter because you've got the Tab - I mean, you don't even really need the chord symbols - if someone's going to read the tab and play it, they don't really need the chord symbols, or, at best, just the suggestion of what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> was in the full version, or, what would work if improvising over it and so on.

Now, granted, it's common to include chord symbols in arrangements like this - not unlike the piano arrangement (which is much more of an arrangement of the original) that I linked to.

But again, you have to think - who is your audience for the chord symbol going to be? The piano arrangement usually has it just so guitarists who can't read can find the chords to play along. Or, again, for people to use as a "suggestion" for improvisation.

I'd call it an Fm6/Ab despite the fact the chord itself has no F in it - play the melody note F over top of it and see what happens...

The Dm7b5/Ab is an acceptable alternative (same chord of course) and both are common in the so-called "Hollywood Cadence". That "evolved from" the IV to the minor iv, to the added 6, so a iv(add6) of some sort is very "traditional" and probably why the arranger of the piano version chose that symbol.

You yourself said it - it *sounds like* a IV - it has "iv-ness" to it. We hear that becuase that's its origin in this kind of context.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are a couple of different types of uses of Chromatic notes.

The two primary ones are as "decoration" or "embellishment" and as "functional" harmonic elements.

For example for the latter one, in the key of C Major, you can introduce a D7 chord to act as the V7/ of the V chord (so you get D7 - G, which looks like V7 - I in the key of G, but it's actually all still in the key of C).

For that, you'd have to make F into F# which could be in the melody, the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or possibly both.

For the former one, you can just "fill in" the gap between two notes a step apart with a chromatic "filler" note, or you can approach a note from above or below. You can do this as a neighbor tone between two of the same note as well.

So:

F - F# - G

or

F# - G

or

G - F# - G

You should listen to the first bit of Beethoven's "Fur Elise" - he hits you with a chromatic neighbor tone idea right at the very beginning (and when you do that, it helps set it up for the rest of the piece).

If you're composing, there are two very common "cliches" and one is even called the "Line Cliche" - you hear this a lot but basically you take a chord, like Em, and move the highest note B up to C, then to C# then either back down, or continue chromatically up (if you go back down, you get the James Bond theme idea). A very famous one is in String of Pearls by Glen Miller.

The other common one takes a chromatically descending bass note with a static <b><u>harmony</u></b> above (so kind "upside down" of the other idea) like a Cm chord with a bass note that goes C, Bn, Bb, An, Ab, G and so on.

We might call this the "Chim Chim Cheree" progression (from the Mary Poppins Disney movie - check it out).
Jim Croce's "Time in a Bottle" does it do, but it goes way back to Bach and Purcell (check out the "Lament" from Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas").

Those both tend to be more harmonic then melodic and it isn't uncommon to have a purely diatonic melody over that chromatic accompaniment, but it also opens up the possibility of more chromatic melodies as well.

Just learn to play as many pieces as you can and the more pieces you learn the more you'll encounter chromaticism and get to understand how it works. There's "Atonal" music which can be highly chromatic, but even some of the most basic Tonal music introduces at least some chromaticism - so it could be worth trying to learn to play at least what you can of things like "Fur Elise" to see how it works in that kind of context.

HTH

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Reason 1: It's yours. We're all far more critical of our own work than we probably need to be. But that's what presses us to strive to be better. But at the same time, you're being too hard on yourself.

Reason 2: You're trying to write a 2 line piece in a musical style where <b><u>harmony</u></b> is a BIG deal. Usually, when 2 line pieces like this are written, there's an IMPLIED <b><u>harmony</u></b> present.

Now it's pretty clear you're using some harmonic framework, but just for example, you've got a V/ii but you don't have THE note that makes it "V" of ii - you really want that C# in there somewhere, as that's the thing that keeps it from being "just" an Am7 chord (which is simply vi7).

In m. 10 you want a vi (vi not VI) but all you've got are octave A notes. That's what makes it "thin" - in general, you've got a lot of places where there are just octaves, or just 3rds (10ths). The octave especially are "thin" or "weak" sounding from a harmonic standpoint. One of the worst places is where you have the V-I marked at the end of the line and just have 8ve Gs moving to 8ve Cs. That would be fine at the very very end of a piece, but at this point it makes your <b><u>harmony</u></b> "drop out" and sound very thin.

Some things like that - we can INFER from what's there that this is a V-I becuase it's SUCH a common thing. But like earlier in that line when you go from vi to bVI and then put "iii" but you've got nothing but G notes - we're not going to infer iii from that - we're going to hear V becuase we've been so conditioned to hear it that way in billions of pieces.

Finally, your next measure with the "?" - that's the dead giveaway - you've got G to A in two parts, then a bunch of A notes. It's just thin - no <b><u>harmony</u></b> - and we're not even sure what to infer from it - it might imply Am (vi), but really, it's just tough to tell in this context (after we hear the V-I a measure lighter, we would retroactively assume it was vi probably). But it's all mostly octaves and no "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" or even "implied <b><u>harmony</u></b>".

Thus it sounds "thin" and "weak".

Solution 1: Add a 3rd note here and there - either add something to the melody line so it plays in 3rds or 6ths (which is common in this style) or otherwise fills out any missing notes of the chords.

Solution 2: Try to hit more chord tones all the time, especially DEFINING ones like the C# mentioned above. For example, if you go from C to Em - using the E and G again in the Em chord don't really do anything because they're also in the C chord. The big note that's different between Em and C is the B - so your Em chord really needs that B becuase it's the one thing the C doesn't have (and that's just an example I'm not sure there are any in your piece).

Reason 3: It seams like you're going for a "Habenera" or "Tango" kind of vibe, and with that in mind the rhythm is not really that bad. It may have to do partly with the sound you've picked as well. Just try it with a guitar sound and see what happens. The bass line does have a lot of rests between notes which tends to make it sound "choppy" - not necessarily bad for this style but it might make more sense if you had a Cello playing pizzicato and the melody done by Violin (which can sustain those long notes). So I say try it with a couple of different instrument sounds and see if you have any different perceptions.

I will add that IMHO the first part is no horrible. About where you have the "?" is where it seems to fall apart - it starts to get a lot weaker through that section and it sounds to me like you worked on the first section for 3 days and only spent an hour or two on the end section - or, it's an idea for a continuation but you're not really sure how to go on yet.

One recommendation I would make - if you want particular harmonies, try using the Root of the chord in the bass on the downbeat. You do that at the beginning and it sounds good. WHen you get to that "iii" which is a G bass, and then it's really a G (since there are no other notes from Em until later in the measure) you're either not following your intention or naming chords wrong. But really it seems like you're not making your chord on beat 1, but halfway through the measure. Where you have a "I" once you have an F above - and while it's like a suspension, it's long enough that we'll probably hear the <b><u>harmony</u></b> as a IV chord. Same thing happens in that "iii" measure - you don't get the Em stuff until halfway through the measure.

It's even worse in the first measure of the last line where you have a C over the G and are "thinking" Em - no my friend, we're hearing that as a C chord (and a wrong one at that) because we're in the key of C.

You want Em, put an E in the bass and a G in the melody, and a B in close proximity.

Your chord progression could be better (intended or implied) but really that's not as big a concern as the way you're fleshing out the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (IOW, it's not what makes it "thin" or "weak" sounding).

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not that it TOOK 3 days, but that you *put that amount of thought into it*! Like you worked on it and crafted it more.

And as you see, that's what you're doing now and already seeing an improvement.

Composing is about "crafting" the music - taking raw ideas (inspiration) and honing them into musical statements (because inspiration can be fleeting, and once it's gone, the really hard work of honing everything comes in).

As far as getting the rhythms to work together and the counterpoint: Maybe try this experiment - take a "Piazzolla-style" rhythmic figure from your accompaniment and use that as the basis for 6 or 7 measures, with the 7th and 8th being a cadence or pause in the action. Then craft your melody over that. It can be "countrapuntal" but it doesn't have to be "counterpoint" per se - it can be  - and probably should be in this type of piece - "filling in" where the LH does not.

Maybe try a simple Tango pattern and write melodies over that. Try a waltz pattern and write melodies over that.

Really, we should start with a melody and "harmonize it", but in these kinds of dance and song forms, the accompaniment usually acts like the motor, so it needs to be running consistently for most of the piece. You can vary it, and come to a stop light every now and again, but otherwise it should be on cruise control.

Once you get the ideas of how to work out your <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody within that kind of rhythmic accompaniment framework, you can work more on getting more variety into both parts, and more counterpoint, etc.

There's no shame in using existing music as a model, so you may want to try to find some simple Tangos or Waltzes for Piano and see how they're approached.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Nope. Just chords. <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. Harmonization as you put it. Interesting progression (as happens a lot with Bowie). It may be the combination of the way it's orchestrated and the progression that makes it stand out, but there's not special name or term for it other than "cool".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Do you want to play really well or just knock around on it?

You don't study music theory to play an instrument.

You study the instrument.

Preferably - if you really want to get good - you study music as well. Learn to read notes, know notes, where are the notes are on the instrument and so on.

Learn to play real songs by real musicians.

Theory comes in later when you start needing to improvise.

Knowing your Notes, Keys, and Major and Minor Scales and Pentatonic Major and Minor scales (as already mentioned) will get you through 80% of most pop music. If you want to play Jazz, you need to know a lot more about <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but it all starts with notes, then Major and Minor KEYS.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Depends.

Firstly, this is a problem with "Scale thinking".

A LOT of music is NOT written "in scales".

It's written in KEYS.

It's really not the best thing to think that, when playing music "In the Key of G Major" that the notes come from the G Major "scale".

They don't. They come from the KEY of G Major.

The scale is just a "listing" of viable pitches if you will.

You shouldn't have a song "in C Blues Major".

You have a song "in C". Or, "in C Mixolydian" or something like that.

The the melody might introduce notes outside of the key - which are "blue" notes.

But it can be folly to consider every single note that appears to be "part of some scale".

We don't even do this in most music. If a piece is in F Major, and we get an F#, we don't say the scale is some sort of crazy phrygian thing. It's just a non-diatonic note added. That's all.

So the idea of subsuming chromatic notes into some "parent scale" or "parent mode" is really faulty thinking for probably 90% of the music most people are interested in playing or creating.

Blues is one huge exception because the melodic material includes "blue notes" which are generally foreign to the mode.

Some of these DO show up in the accompanying figures as well though. So they COULD be part of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

But really, saying all the melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> "comes from X scale" is usually a vast oversimplification in music that adds non-diatonic elements.

There is certainly 20th century and beyond music where BOTH the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody are derived from a single scale, such as the Whole Tone scale.

But there is also music where multiple scales/keys/modes are used simultaneously.

Your argument is based on a premise for only a small sample of the music that's out there.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Renaissance music is Modal, not Tonal (though in the late Renaissance, Modality was transitioning into Tonality).

So you need to forget "keys" - they didn't exist yet!

Chord progressions in modal music often sound "backwards" to us and in fact a lot of modern listeners will think a modal piece "ended on the wrong chord".

But, as an aside, G Major is ABSOLUTELY in the **Key** of C minor. The Major V chord is the **native** dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b>. In *Tonal* music, it's the minor v that's super rare (comparatively). In fact, when we encounter a minor v in Tonal music, we call it a "modal dominant" becuase it hearkens back to the days when modes used minor v chords, which happens in Dorian and ultimately Aeolian.

Late Renaissance music is tricky because many "incipient Tonal" elements are starting to creep in - more use of Ionian and Aeolian modes (which eventually become Major and Minor Keys) and more use of what sound like tonal cadences to us (V-I).

Modal pieces very often used a MAJOR V-I even in modes where the v would otherwise be minor - so in Mixolydian for example, interior v chords would be "modal v" - minor v, while the one at a cadence would be turned into a Major V ("borrowing" is not really the right term here and we don't even really consider V in minor keys to be "borrowed" in the same way other borrowed chords are, again because it's considered native to the the minor mode).

This could very well be iv - i - iv - V - I - in G Aeolian - with a cadential major V and Picardy Third on the I chord (both common).

That's the view from a Modal perspective.

From a tonal perspective we'd probably hear it as i - v - i - V7/v - V in C Aeolian, with a half cadence on the G - but that's not really what's going on, so approaching this music from a tonal perspective can make things more confusing than they need to be!

So yes, to "get into it", you need to get into it - listen to tons, figure out the melodic and harmonic material, read up on modality (not the modern kind) and try re-creating it.

Have fun!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hmm. Hard to say.

Firstly, it may have more to do with Music Cognition or Music Psychology.

In the first, there is a vocal <b><u>harmony</u></b> that hasn't already been present and on the word "alive" there's this rise in pitch as the melody crosses over into the next part that also isn't something we've heard before.

So there's a freshness - part of this is songwriting and part of it can be arrangement and production.

When people sing each syllable on its own pitch we call that "syllabic" and when they sing more than one pitch per syllable (especially many notes like a Whitney Houston thing) it's called "melismatic".

Those words are maybe a little academic (melisma is a term used to describe when people in the middle ages sang "A-Men" but rather than two notes, sang like 30 notes on the "A-" alone - that's a melisma).

But we also use words like "declamatory" and "florid" for each manner.

And that's really all they are, different manners of singing.

What can happen is, if you hear a bunch of declamatory singing, then some florid singing, the contrast between the two is fresh and catches your attention.

In the KT, nothing about that really grabs me in any way. The harmonic rhythm picks up (meaning more chords per measure, or more different chords per measure) and we generally feel that as a "build" - kind of like all these EDM songs that have those big cliched build ups that have 4 notes then 8 then 16 where it keeps doubling in speed (usually on drums or a percussive hit) - it's just building in tension.

A lot of time this happens through arrangement - more instruments get added, things get denser, more activity happens, and so on. It's not a "theory" thing per se, but an arrangement thing.

All theory might do is say "the harmonic rhythm picked up".

So in KT, it's kind of a "Drone" to begin with - alternating between only two harmonies - not unlike "Norwegian Wood" by The Beatles which usually, while state, builds up a little tension. Her vocals are also largely monotone - then she ends on the b7th, which is traditionally a dissonant tone in need of resolution. It's not always in modern pop music but here it's definitely a call back to that kind of vibe,

so all that sets the stage for this Pre-Chorus, which is new, fresh, conrasting, and in some ways releases the tension by having more different chords and the vocal melody is much more far-ranging - it's almost a Lennon verse and McCartney pre-chorus in that respect.

AFIAK, the word "Hook" used to be used for the thing that grabbed you, which tended to be a chorus or something like "Can't Touch This" (which I suppose is also a chorus). "Centerfold" by J. Geils starts right off with the hook - the "na na" part. But in the old days, the "hook" could also be a musical figure, such as a melody or guitar riff or bass line and so on.

Nowadays the producer set seems to use the term a little differently but I wouldn't consider either of the examples you point to as "hooks" per se. They are  more about "setting up the next section". Maybe a "cliffhanger" might be a better analogy.

How they do it has to do with conditioning.

It the same reason "suspense cues" in films work - and why we tend to keep using similar musical ideas for them (low drones, high drones, tremolo strings, or sustained rolls, or repeated marimba notes and so on - there's a "nervousness" in the sound itself which contributes to the tension in the scene).

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>1. Perfect Pitch is absolutely not a limitation - in fact, having it can be a limitation.
2. Yeah, hard to get away from that one! My advice would be to remember that music is an ART not a science. Everything in music is context-based.
3. Would really recommend you try to learn a musical instrument - keyboard at least - even if just enough to run through chords - but you need to know what you're doing with notes and so on.

Yes.

There are general rules that define musical styles. I'm trying to think of any kind of engineering analogies but I'm not remotely familiar with the field. We could say that Clocks, Metronomes, Timers, and Stopwatches are all "Timepieces". And they work on very similar mechanisms. But because each has a different purpose, they might be designed differently - for example, with a clock with a pendulum you always want it two swing once or twice per second (whatever makes it work). But with a metronome, you want to be able to adjust that. So the same "rules" don't apply. The metronome has to have something extra that the clock doesn't. And A Timer needs to run in reverse, and a stopwatch needs to start, stop, and reset. And there are completely different styles between analog gear-driven mechanisms and digital timepieces. And just to throw a wrench in, don't forget that there are analog timepieces like sundials, and those pendulums that swing but stay in the same direction even through the Earth rotates. There are "water clocks" and "ball bearing clocks" and so on.

So music is much the same - Mozart doesn't use "Blues Scales"

But since music is an art, we can absolutely juxtapose styles - we can play a Moxart style accompaniment that's diatonic, and put a blues scale over top. Or we can take a Baroque piece and play it in a Jazz feel (like Jethro Tull's version of Bach's Bouree in Em).

Sometimes these can come off as just silly, but other times they can create new and interesting styles or stylistic offshoots - much in the way that Steampunk kind of juxtaposes victorian-era steam-based principles with modernistic mechanisms that didn't or couldn't exist back then.

So "rules" simply define a given style. If you don't play any blue notes in your blues, it's not going to sound very bluesy! But if you start adding blue notes into a Baroque concerto, it may sound wholly out of place.

When creating your own music, you can create your own style but you have to remember that listeners are going in with preconceived notions so if you do things that don't sound "logical" to them based on what tidbits of style you're giving them, they're going to think it sounds bad.

So you can absolutely play a Whole Tone melody against a 4 note chromatic <b><u>harmony</u></b> that shares only two notes. But since that wouldn't be following the rules of most existing styles, it's not going to be effective. It's like calling something a clock but it only moves from 0 to 1 and back. Or takes 70 years for 1 unit to pass. Sure, it's "music", but it may be missing the things that delmit the definition.

But if you only follow the rules for a style in art, you just end up making another boring old clock. Music is more like the Goofy (Disney character) watch I used to have - it ran backwards. It stretched the definition of a watch enough to be interesting and creative, without doing it so much that it was no longer a timepiece.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not every chromatic note is functional.

Without knowing the underlying <b><u>harmony</u></b> it's impossible to tell.

Without knowing the tempo, you can't be sure. Usually an F# in 8th notes like this is going to be treated as a chromatic passing tone.

But this is being harmonized in a very typical jazz fashion where it's about placing intervals below the melody note - but what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is is important and we can't always get that just from this.

It could be C going to to C7 (C9) to A7/C# which would move on to Dm7 in the next measure.

But without knowing, this is but one solution of many.

And yes, that's an A7/C#.




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There's nothing wrong with changing keys from B to F then back again.

It's maybe a little uncommon, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.

But I am a little concerned that you've written music and don't know what key it is. The Key of F BTW has only ONE flat.

Key is based on what note/<b><u>harmony</u></b> sounds like "home". If B sounds like home, then the key is B and if that agrees with the 5# key signature, then you're golden.

But it's always possible that if you don't know your keys well, you may have written in a mode and that 5# may work for convenience's sake, but it's actually C# Dorian, or D# Phrygian. There's every chance if you're thinking F and saying 2 flats you're already in F Mixolydian.

So without seeing the music it's really hard to tell. You may in fact be going from B to F and B - and again there's nothing wrong with that - but I'm concerned that you actually may be in some other keys and there's a more obvious solution and "something is wrong"....
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well maybe to be clear, let me first say that when a jazz player says "harmonize", they often mean "create triads on every melody note".

You'll hear jazz players refer to "the harmonized scale", by which they mean if you take a C Major scale, you end up with the chords C-dm-em-F and so on up the scale - or by extension, the 7th or 9th chord versions of the scale.

This is totally different from what "classical" or non-jazz people mean when they say "harmonize". In the case of popular music, it could mean putting chords to a melody, but not necessarily on a per-melody note basis. But it could also mean "harmonizing" a line in parallel 3rds or 6ths (or rarely, both, but that gets closer to the jazz meaning). So when Lennon and McCartney are singing in parallel 3rds, it's just one voice following the other up or down at that interval - sometimes regardless of the chord.

In "harmonizing" in classical music, we mean more like jazz - where we take an individual melody note and put a chord under it.

But those are essentially chorale-style melodies, not "bop" melodies like the examples given here.

IOW, we don't in classical music generally harmonize fast-moving lines note-per-note.

So maybe another way to put that is, harmonization of a melody line in jazz usually means putting triads or larger chords on each note of a melody, while in classical and pop, harmonizing fast-moving melody lines is usually limited to only 1 other interval, such as parallel 3rds or 6ths (there can be exceptions of course, but I mean in general).

So when you start talking about "secondary dominant" you're tending to think more of a chorale style - which these are probably not intended to be slow-moving one by one melodic notes.

So like harmonizing in 3rds or 6ths in pop music, that us usually done with two things in mind:

1. The key
2. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> at hand

So, for example, the line C-D-E in the key of Em would usually be harmonized with E-F#-G above or below.

But, if the <b><u>harmony</u></b> was a C chord for 2 beats and then it changed to an E MAJOR chord when the melody arrives at the E, the harmonizing line would go E-F#-G# instead.

Honestly this is an incredibly complex subject and the way Soli writing, and Chord-Melody writing, and the way "harmonized scales" are used in jazz are very in-depth subjects.

Really, your best answer it to learn to play lots and lots of music that do these things, and figure out how they work. It's not something you're going to be able to look at a few abstracted excerpts and understand how to do.

I mean, sit down with a melody line over a ii - V - I progression and try harmonizing it. as Yoda just said, "failure is the best teacher". Try it, and if you don't like what you did, try it again, until you figure out what sounds good.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'd never say music isn't for you. Let's just say, we're only allotted a short time on this planet and while learning by trial and error is absolutely the way to learn, taking the advice of mentors and learning from people who've already made all the errors can help you cut down on the trial part of it!

Those "basics" come from the music itself.

If you don't understand them, it may be difficult to get a lot out of theory texts - but can you be more specific about what you're looking for, or maybe, tell us what books you already have?

University level theory texts can be costly.

And if you're into popular music, "classical" theory really doesn't help you all that much.

The Beatles studied the music of their predecessors (and probably had a bit of training on various instruments as well). And if you're into popular music, that's kind of what you have to do because there's not really any kind of writing (that's worth much) on how to write that kind of music. The text is the music.

But there are "academic" theory, orchestration, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, counterpoint, etc. texts out there - some can be affordable and worthwhile - really depends on what it is you're trying to accomplish.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Are you supposed to see the red and blue in purple?

I think you're way over-thinking this.

If you want, do some research into music cognition.

But yes, you're supposed to notice <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and melody. And rhythm, and texture, and dynamics, and timbre, etc. etc.

Most people notice these things, but don't necessarily have words for them. Also, once one learns about a particular thing (like timbre) they tend to pay more attention to it.

The more things you know about music, the more things there are to pick out - yeah, we can't pay attention to everything at once, but luckily we can listen repeatedly if we like!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>However, despite the other two responses, this is probably not Classical music so invoking the Neapolitan is not necessarily appropriate, especially since it's not in first inversion and adds a 7th.

That said though, it's a SOUND we're familiar with from way back then.

But it also appears later as Ger+6 built on scale degree b2 (and other +6 chord types) and in Jazz as a Tritone Substitute (though the major 7 is a little different here).

u/Arran46_2

People seem to have this idea that chords have to "come from" somewhere, or that they need to be "justified" in some way and this is absolutely not true. Maybe even ridiculous.

In fact, all of the chords mentioned - Neapolitan, Augmented 6th - they don't "come from" anywhere. 

They're classed as "Chromatic <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" usually and are also classed as "Voice Leading Chords" because where they "come from" if you will, is voice-leading practices which gives them a logic of their own and there's no need to invoke other modes to explain or justify them.

b2 can appear in some contexts as being from the parallel Phrygian mode - so it is possible a bII might appear in that manner. But we don't say every viio/V "come from" the Lydian mode (because it comes from another key). So it might be seen as "native" to keys as a common Chromatic chord. Since it shares a common tone with the Tonic chord, it might be heard as a partial Tritone Sub, especially if it resolves down to I. Most people don't care where Tritone Subs come from, becuase they're a substitute for the V chord, not really from another mode so to speak.

So it depends on the context a bit, but there's no need to "justify it" by saying it came from somewhere. It's a familiar sound, it sounds good, use it.

BTW, you wrote bIV(maj7) but I think you meant bVI - It's Return of the Jedi, not A New Hope.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It depends.

Roman Numeral analysis is really "designed" if you will for Tonal music, and in that context, the numerals carry more information than just "naming the chord".

We don't (or shouldn't) use Roman Numeral analysis on pre-Tonal music (aside from drawing connections for music that is close to Tonality) becuase it doesn't tell us anything. It simply "names the chords" (which may actually be counter-productive in more linear-based music).

Roman Numeral analysis of post-Tonal music is likewise not very useful unless there is some element it can point out that is common enough to be worth mentioning.

I've seen analyses of certain Debussy pieces where a Roman Numeral analysis actually shows how the work has strong ties to tonal functional progressions.

In Les Cloches, it certainly doesn't make sense to label every single chord in the opening accompaniment. It may be worth pointing out the neighbor motion of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> sets up a nice "swaying" sound. It might be interesting to note that while the pattern itself ascends, harmonically it sort of descends (F#m7/C# to EMaj7/D#-E). It may be interesting to note that the chords are both inverted, save for that last 8th note but at the end of the first phrase, we finally get an F# bass note and no harmonic change.

What key is it in? Key sig says E or C#m - it ends on a nice E Major chord - so if so, this must be ii4/3 - IM4/2

That tells us the roots are a 2nd apart, that they're both 7th chords that are inverted. It might tell someone more familiar that the 7ths aren't resolving an that the Tonic chord isn't a triad (though one might be able to make a case that the D# is an Appoggiatura).

But do those labels convey all that information effectively?

The A# in measure 9 is certainly reminiscent of a V7/V and it moves to a V (9)

Is that worth pointing out?

What about the final cadence - how is that like, or unlike traditional cadences - does a simple chord label say enough about that?

This kind of music reminds me of Early Music - Rennaisance music and before. It uses "chords" which in many cases are familiar to us. They're also sometimes used in ways that are familiar to us. But labelling them with Roman Numerals doesn't really convey the important aspects of Modal music that we'd probably want to point out. Chord labels might tell us how it's similar to Tonal music, but not how it differs.

Furthermore, it has a tendency to make us look at everything through a "Tonal lens" and at the worst, compare it unfavorably because it doesn't meet those stylistic standards.

I see post-Tonal music - including pop and jazz as the exact same way. Sure, it uses chords, some familiar, and it uses ideas, some familiar, but IMHO we should actually break with Tonality completely and develop a new system for analysis - because it does become just "naming the chords" not unlike we'd do with Palestrina. It's fine for pieces that are highly indebted to tonal style or clearly evolved from it, but for other music it makes no sense (or doesn't tell us anything we don't already know).

I would encourage you to move beyond <b><u>harmony</u></b> and look at larger things - form, phrase, melody, and with <b><u>harmony</u></b>, look it too in broader strokes, like "upward motion" or "voice exchange" and principles like that rather than getting into properly labeling each chord.

However, you can still discover stuff like, hey, this composer really likes going from X to Y as a parallel to (substitute for, analog of) a Plagal-like cadence. That can help you to discover stylistic traits of individual composers or schools of composition.

So go through and figure out the chords, and look for larger and repeated processes, but don't get too bogged down in the labeling of chords - if doing so reveals some important aspect, then by all means do, but otherwise, often the general shape is enough.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, given that the structures aren't just random, it's likely he intentionally chose two "known" chord types to stack.

As he had been experimenting with/using bi-tonality this was already part of his vocabulary.

It's also likely he may have come up with the idea long before and just finally found the perfect place to implement it.

I was thinking about your thread title and it actually leans a little differently than the subject of your post.

When you said "too much emphasis on <b><u>harmony</u></b>" I not only take that in the way I posted above, but here's something else to consider:

When I see someone write a 12 bar blues, I consider the <b><u>harmony</u></b> to be a "non-issue". By that I mean exactly the opposite of what your thread title says - the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is a "stock" thing. No need for experimentation to "come up with something unusual" - it like doesn't even matter. So I see that as sort of the antithesis to Brian Wilson and the idea of "experimentation".

So, yes "theory" shouldn't "force" you to use particular "acceptable" progressions, and "what sounds good is good". But at the same time, emphasis on other musical elements is just as important - to not "fall down the rabbit hole" of <b><u>harmony</u></b> and "hip choices" and so on. But also at the same time, <b><u>harmony</u></b> can go to the point of being totally unimportant - here are some chords, hey it's a 12 bar, OK, on to the other elements of music.

So "stock" forms can sort of help remove the obsession with <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the over-reliance on it.

Which could be a practical tool for someone writing so they don't get "distracted by" all the harmonic possibilities - when none exist, you get on to writing the melody!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You might be a little confused.

The Chord C-E-G can be **voiced** any way we want. What that means is, C, E, or G can be the lowest sounding note.

They could also be the highest sounding note, the middle note, or even duplicates and triplicates, etc. of the notes in any position.

When we say a chord is "inverted" we usually mean that some note other than the Root is "in the bass" - which in that context means, the lowest **sounding** note (so not necessarily sung by a bass singer, or played by a bass instrument).

Inversion is a slightly misunderstood concept by many - many people learn and continue to think that taking C-E-G and "rotating" it by putting the C on top, giving - E-G-C is "inverting" the chord.

It is, but "inversion" has 100% to do with which chord member is the **lowest sounding note** and 0% to do with anything else!

So, if you have a C Chord, and C - the root - is the lowest sounding note, we say it's in Root Position.

If you have an E, the 3rd of the chord, as the lowest sounding note, it's in First Inversion. Period.

So if you play a C chord, and "invert it", but then you use a "bass" (which is assumed to be the lowest sounding notes) of something other than E, then it's not in First Inversion anymore. You've "de-inverted" it!!!!

C = Root Position

C/E = First Inversion

C/G = Second Inversion.

Or,

Root in bass = Root Position

3rd in Bass = 1st Inversion

5th in Bass = 2nd Inversion

Another source of confusion for keyboard players is, they often see their RH notes as separate from their LH notes. So often, a keyboard player will play an "inversion" with their RH - so they might play C-E-G, or G-C-E with their RH - if they do the 2nd one they might say it's 2nd inversion.

It would be, by itself, but, if the LH is playing a C below, it's still Root Position becuase C is the lowest sounding note of everything being played.

Now, sometimes, a Pianist or Guitarist might play a chord, and then a Bass player play another note below what they're playing - so the Pianist or Guitarist might have some note other than the root as the lowest note THEY are playing - making it an inversion from their perspective, but we would usually talk about the ENTIRE <b><u>harmony</u></b> being played, including the Bass note - and if it's the lowest sounding pitch, then that's what the inversion is gauged from.

So if you're on keyboard, and you change the voicing of the RH, it doesn't really change the inversion because that's based on the lowest sounding note (usually in the LH). It only changes the **voicing** of the chord.

Here is a First Inversion C chord, low to high, with letters before the "/" for the LH and letters after for the RH:

E / C-G

Here are some more:

E / C-E-G

E / G-C-E

E/ E-C-G

and also

E-G-C / C-E-G-C

E-C / G

E-G-C-E / G-C-E-G

So you see, it doesn't matter how the upper notes are distributed or how many of them there are, as long as the notes for a C chord are present you've got a C chord. But when the lowest sounding note is the THIRD of the chord (in this case E), it's in First Inversion.

So all of those above are in First Inversion.

If you play E-G-C in the RH, then the Bass note in the LH can by ANY C, E, or G. But if it's C it's in Root Position, G 2nd Inversion, etc.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>What is it, specifically that these 3 people found fault with?

When you say "composition-wise" that could be many things, not just the chord progression.

What it sounds like to a listener is that your bass line, your melody, and your chords don't "agree", and traditionally, they should.

It makes things sound "wrong" - IOW, your melodies have "wrong notes" in them. And that makes it sound like someone who doesn't know what they're doing (because plenty of people who don't know what they're doing post music that sounds like this).

When you go to the Fm7 chord, you "bass line" (which is really a melody) is Eb - Gb - Eb - that really sounds "wrong"

What you've essentially done is used Ab (G#) Pentatonic Minor for the melody (bass line) sometimes with the Blue note in it. So you're playing chords that aren't "in a key", yet your trying to play a melody that is "in a key" over top of it.

The Blue note when used makes a Major 3rd over the Bbm7 (A#m7) which clashes with the m3 of the song and usually it's the OPPOSITE to get a "bluesy" sound - so it sounds completely backwards - again like someone who doesn't know what they're doing.

But that Eb - Gb - Eb - idea right before the Gm7 chord really screams an Ebm7 chord (or ans Eb7 where the Gb can be bluesy).

When the 2nd melody comes in, it too is at odds - I'm not tearing it apart but it sounds like you've got more of that blue note portion of the Pentatonic Minor scale going on and not only are both clashing with the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but with each other as well.

I agree with the previous comments that changing the progression rather than adding the 2nd like would be better - it really is repetitive and boring (and that could be a compositional issue too).


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There is no point.

Figured Bass WAS used a long time ago by accompanists. It evolved as a way for Organists to take Vocal scores - which were 4 staves tall, and play along. You see, it's really hard to read 4 staves at once, so what they did was read just the Bass part (the lowest staff) and then write numerals over the bass staff (or under) so show what intervals were being sung above the bass part.

It evolved into a system that let a keyboard accompanist improvise a <b><u>harmony</u></b> part (within stylistic guidelines).

In that way, it's actually quite similar to Jazz "Lead Sheets" where you get just the vocal melody and the chords written out (which can specify some inversions and bass notes).

So there's a bit of relevance there and maybe an interesting historical lesson in that the ways we notate music are dictated by needs. Since there's an improvisational component, sometimes the less you write down, the better.

In Music Theory curricula it is usually taught to help students understand voice-leading principles.

IOW, if you give a student a melody and say "harmonize it", they'll be all over the place without guidance. By having the bass line, maybe the melody line as well, and the figures, the students can "realize" the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and fill in the inner notes, hopefully with better voice leading than they would have done if they weren't guided by the figures and the given bass and melody parts.

If one becomes interested in Early Music and into the Baroque where this type of accompaniment flourished, one could study it on through grad school and beyond. I know 3 harpsichordists in our area (well, sadly, one just passed) who could sit down at the harpsichord with a score with figured bass on it and realize a harpsichord part right on the spot.

JP Rameau, in his Treatise on <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, has a section on realization practices - "how to make music from Figured Bass" so to speak. That's about 1720 ish.

Also, the inversion symbols we use in analysis are derived from/based on Figured Bass ideas, so one additional element of learning Figured Bass is so Inversional Symbols make sense and correlate.

However, aside from your wanting to realize for analysis, or perform from figured bass scores where no other realizations exist, or you want to make your own, there is absolutely no reason to learn how to use Figured Bass.

Likewise, there is absolutely no reason to learn to write it unless you are planning to write Baroque style music you'd like to be performed in an authentic, improvisatory manner, or find a similar use for improvisation keyboard parts you write that aren't notated some more effective way.

And the use in Theory class.

However, if you are taking a theory course and you are being taught figured bass, but you think "why do I need this because I want to be a film composer" then you are really selling yourself short and going in with the wrong attitude.

It's better to know something and choose not to use it, than to not be aware of something - because then you can't use it if you need to.

Other than the additional familiarity with writing music and musical practices of the past, and the general principle which might be adaptable in some circumstances, as well as just the mental exercise that might yield deeper understanding of music, Figured Bass is pretty useless for modern composers.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; What's the distinction between a "bass line" and a "melody"? Are bass lines not melodies?

Bass lines can be melodies, and when we thing "line" we often thing melody. BUt sometimes they can be more just rhythmic, or sometimes like a "riff" or pattern, and sometimes they can just be in long notes that evolve so slowly they don't really sound like a melody on their own. Also, if they're just a "foundation" - a "base" note, then we often hear them more as part of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> rather than as an individual melody.

Usually they're also low - they don't have to be in a low register necessarily but yours is kind of in mid-range level which make it sound a little less like a bass line and more like just a low melody.

Just for example, when I played it on guitar it's like smack in the middle of the range of the guitar - and usually you have a Bass player who's playing notes lower than guitar.

So that's kind of just a general thing, but it has more of an effect of a "lead synth" line than a "bass line" per se.

You could drop it down an octave and see what it sounds like.

Next question, next post.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; What makes the Fm7 chord clash with the melody?

It's Eb - Gb - Eb above it.

These responses are out of order but if you look at the one that begins "lets see if I can help" you notice I went through possible keys or commonalities.

While Gb is in the first chord, and is in a potential key the first two chords could be in, the Fm7 "shifts" our perspective to another key where the G note would be the "right" note - and, since the Gm7 comes after, the G note makes more sense again.

But there's a secondary issue and that again is the register you play it in - again it's kind of high.

If you dropped the bass an octave, that Eb becomes more of a "bass note" - and in fact it's going to make that Fm7 chord sound more like it's some kind of Eb11 chord (which might be a nice effect).

That's one of the things that also makes it sound "wrong" though - that Eb to D move in the bass line is kind of common, so we kind of want to hear an Eb type chord on that note (Ebm7 because of the Gb).

If it was an octave lower, we might interpret the Fm7 above just as harmonic extensions but as it is, it kind of sounds like "I WANT AN FM <b><u>harmony</u></b> but I"m going to stick in the WRONG bass note!".

IIRC, your first chord Abm7 has an Ab in the bass (it goes from Gb right to Ab, both notes in the chord)

You go up to Eb with the next chord, Bbm7, which is a little odd but since both those chords could be in the key of Ebm, it's not horrible (it's a common sound). ANd that works a little more becuase we're hearing this more as a melody rather than it causing any kind of inversion or other <b><u>harmony</u></b>. But when it gets to the Fm7 it becomes confusing as to what that line is - wait, is it melody, or is it bass, is it supposed to support the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or be a melodic tone on top - all those make it sound as another poster put it - not "deliberate" on your part - a mistake - "wrong".

IOW, even though the Eb is part of the Fm7, you'd be much better off with F and Ab in that chord.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; I wasn't even aware that I composed the bass melody in a key. I just improvised it. 

Well, sometimes doing thing by ear can result in cool things that if you tried to "theory it out" you wouldn't come up with.

But I think a secondary issue is one I've been mentioning already a bit - it's not really clear if it's a "bass line" or "melody" - it kind of straddles the line. That in itself is kind of cool - if done effectively - but I don't think you did.

Usually a bass line plays "base" or "foundational" notes.

It's OK for it to move around melodically and play other notes of the chord but very often it tries to emphasize the ROOT of the chord first and foremost, then if any chord is in a specific inversion, it emphasizes that. Then it tends to emphasize other chord tones, and then maybe "fill in" with either notes that connect one bass note to the next chord's bass note, or notes of the scale or key, or whatever works like in my other post (which becomes trickier).

If your progression is Abm7 - Bbm7 - Fm7 - Gm7, you might want your bass line to focus on Ab - Bb - F - G (one note per chord change)

You might be able to be sneaky and do - Cb - Bb - Ab - G - which is a note in each chord.

Or you could do Ab - Bb - Ab - Bb - it's the root of each of the first two chords, and the 3rd of each of the 2nd two!

You could even do Ab - Bb - C - D which might sound cool.

Then your line can be mostly rhythmic, and other notes used more to give rhythmic variety rather than be so "melodic".

IOW, focus on the foundational notes of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and "elaborate" them with other notes.

You could improvise them, but I think your problem may have been that you were used to improvising in a certain scale (or you may have done it subconsciously) or you just grabbed the first thing that seemed to work without really paying too much attention to it, or you just don't have enough listening experience to know when something sounds askew - at least when you first did it.

I should also note that there is a style where people use the same chord structure less as a "chord" and more as an effect, so you can get away with more "wrong" notes in that context, but because of the way you did this and the sounds you chose, it seemed more like you were going for "notes that should go with the chords and chords that should go with the notes!".


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Weill, in one way, the major/minor system (keys) kind of exploded - the music go more and more chromatic, usuing more and more note outside of the key more and more consistently, to the point where even calling a piece "in the key of D Major" or whatever became pretty useless.

Fetis, a theorist, predicted an impending "Omnitonique" era - where all tones were equal - IOW no one single note stood out as "Tonic" (the keynote). This was realized as the ultra-chromatic music of Wagner and his school evolved into the early music of Schoenberg, and his students Berg and Webern, where they started using what we call "Atonality" or a s Schoenberg preferred, "Pantonality". Schoenberg ended up developing a "method for composing with 12 notes" where all the notes were equal. He did this by using "Serial" principles, which used 12 note "Tone Rows" to organize musical pitch.

Kind of at the same time, other composers became interested (or re-interested if you like) in the ancient modes as well as the music of other cultures. Debussy especially spearheaded this movement (along with others of course) and the Paris Exhibition exposed him to Oriental scales and so on. So he started incorporating not just Major and Minor, but "synthetic scales" like Whole Tone, Pentatonic Scales from the Orient, and ancient "rediscovered" Modes, among other things.

Composers like Stravinksy and Bartok used other methods, like breaking down musical ideas into little "cells" where the intervals in the cell became more important building blocks rather than traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b> or melody. Stravinsky did things like put two or three keys together at once. Both of them were also influenced by native folk songs - some of which were more modal.

In the popular music world, Jazz incorporated "blue notes" from blues, which again stem from another culture, and sort of inspired by the harmonies of the French composers who started making "taller" chords using 9ths, 11, and 13ths and other "added note harmonies", the 7th chord sort of became the de-facto structure for music, rather than the triad as in Classical music.

So in kind of a really simplistic sense, you can say that some composers stretched the major/minor system by introducing more and more non-tonal elements, to the point where they kind of wiped the slate clean and started over with a different way of organizing music. Other composers just "expanded" on tonality by introducing "taller chords" and "foreign scales" which gave them new melodic and harmonic resources, but were still able to maintain some elements of traditional "key-based" music.

Broad overview of course, but that's the general idea.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Chord progressions evolved over a very long time. What we still see a lot of today, and the examples you give, are based on “functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>”

As others have mentioned “why” is not really a question we can answer but generally speaking composers began to prefer certain successions of chords that “progress” toward the Tonic. A “hierarchical” structure evolved where certain professions “lead to” the tonic chord. 

Part of this has to do with a preference for “ascending progressions “ including the already mentioned 4th root movement. Using, for example, ii-V gives you a pair of notes that can smoothly voice lead to and “collapse in”!on the root of the next chord (a principle developed earlier in counterpoint). 

A secondary consideration is that as Tonality evolved, there are some progressions that make the Key obvious while others don’t, and again composers began to favor these. 

For example and F followed by G or Dm followed by G can only be one key - C Major. So these progressions become “tonal identifiers”

As a counter example in c major you don’t want a progression that goes iii-vi-iii as that’s going to sound like Am or Em and NOT C major!

So not only did they use functional professions but additionally favored those chord and progressions with those chords that most clearly establish he key center. 

As for the 7ths and 9ths - you’re looking at something out together by a jazz player. Jazz players basically assume a 7th or higher on every chord

V-I could be V9-Imaj7 for example. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Eg a few months ago I didn't know what a secondary dominant was. Now that I do, I can study a piece of music, identify the concept then enhance my understand of how I could use it in my work.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now I'm aiming to understand more complex chord progressions using the names and concepts music theory provides, just like when I learned the basics like secondary dominants before.

I see your point here.

I would say, the problem here is that you would need concrete examples to work with becuase of the variability.

For example, you say "cool chords" but what might sound cool to you might be a totally non-functional progression.

So here's the great thing about theory - when music does the same thing consistently, we can give it a name, describe a concept, and so on. But when it does things that aren't that way - which still may sound quite "cool" - we don't really have any meaningful tools to describe it.

And part of the issue here is your statement about "nearly all Western music" being functional - it's not. And even functional pieces can (and often do) include non-functional passages.

Another mistake a lot (most) people make is assuming that because music uses chords, it's functional. Most popular music today is not "textbook definition" functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

&gt;Right now, I'm struggling to 'describe' how they work within theory which makes it hard to make such progressions on my own. Without the explanations/descriptions I'm seeking, it'll be hard to replicate the things I'm hearing in others' work.

I think you're wrong here, and it's your own - pardon the word - ignorance (I mean that in the "not knowing something" definition, not an insult) that is keeping you from fully grasping this. Sure, the "prescriptive" deal - you understand that - but I think there's a part of that that is applicable that you don't seem to think is.

You can absolutely replicate the things you hear in others' works. In fact, there's a LOT of people out there who write music without even knowing the theory part of it and just replicating ideas from others.

When you hear a cool progression, all you need to do is store the chord relationships and when you want that sound, you use that tool.

OK, it might be nice to have  a name for it, but you do need to understand that people just don't bother naming anything that really doesn't seem to deserve naming.

Why things sound good or work is conditioning.

A term merely defines it.

But it's the SOUND you need - yes, for things that have terms, knowing the terms that are associated with the sound is going to help.

But for other things you have to rely on your ears.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>1. No, in the KEY of C, C is the one and only Tonic. So at the beginning when you said it "might" be C - no, it IS C! However, it is completely possible to change keys within a piece, so from that standpoint, you could in fact change to the key of F - and if you're in the key of F, then F is the Tonic at that point. So a piece in the key of C could modulate to the key of F for a portion of the song and then on to some other key, like Dm for another portion of the song, and then finally back to C for another portion of the song. There is another possibility which is called "Tonicization" where some chord other than the "real" Tonic is *temporarily* treated like the Tonic. So in a piece in C, for two chords, the Am chord might be treated like a Tonic - but these usually happen for only just a couple of chords. In all cases, usually if the piece begins and ends in the key of C, and/or is primarily in the key of C, we say the whole piece is "in C" and any other things we specify, like "but modulates to E for the Bridge" and things like that.
2. Not really. Or, at least, it's not the most musical way to approach things (though it could yield interesting results). A common mistake beginners - especially guitarists - make is learning modes! It just confuses issues. If a piece is in the KEY of C Major, and you're "drawing from the notes of C Major to make your chords" - which might be C, F and G, or I, IV, and V for example, then you should also be "drawing from the notes of C Major" for your melodies and improvisation as well. This seems to be the one concept that people refuse to grasp, and it's the stinking easiest thing in the world, and how music is actually written - if you're playing music in a Key, then you draw your notes for anything you're playing - <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody included, from that Key. Period. It's really that simple. When someone says "you play Lydian over the IV chord" it's getting into something that's not really the best way to be comprehending it. You see this in guitar magazines (or you used to in the old days) where analaysis of the guitar solo was like "he uses Aeolian over the Em chord and Lydian over the C chord..." No. He's playing Em over chords from the key of Em. That simple.
3. Mainly taste, but you're venturing dangerously close to Jazz here ;-).  In Jazz, the "basic harmonic unit" if you like is a 7th chord, or at least some chord that adds notes beyond the basic Triad. So even if you see it written "I" or "C" as the first chord in the song, it's likely going to get played as a CMaj7, or C6 or something like that. In rock, despite what most people say, 7th chords are not completely rare, but it's common to intermix triads and 7th chords freely, as well as potential 9ths through 11ths and so on - and in some cases such progressions are directly influenced by Jazz. In Jazz, it's common to avoid Triads, almost like the plague! Again that's a bit of an oversimplification but it can sound more out of place in Jazz to just throw a plain old F chord in the middle of a progression which is full of 7th and 9th chords for example. The contrast may be a little to stark. So really it has more to do with the STYLE of the music. In basic old Folk music, or older Country music based on those styles, you generally use Triads only, except for V which is almost always V7. Some rock songs may avoid 7ths altogether and use Triads - or in many cases, only "Power Chords" which aren't even full triads. So depends on the style, or even song, what is appropriate (and whether it's a style where you typically improvise more or not).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>When I was 12 or 13 and just learning enough about music theory to be dangerous, I "came up" with an idea of what I still kind of refer to as "un-<b><u>harmony</u></b>" and that is, things that resolve down instead of up.

For example, I noticed the parallel (or mirror image if you like) of G/B going to Cm as the same as F/C going to C - the half step movement in the moving voices were inversions of each other.

In some ways, the b6 to 5 motion in minor is not unlike an "upside-down" version of the leading tone to 1. In some ways, if you consider 7-1 a "borrowing from major" when used in minor, then b6-5 as a "borrowing from minor" used in major extends that parallel ever further.

Later, I came to understand it's why Bach's "Art of the Fugue" Subject works like it does...

And when in high school I took an art class, I learned about "negative space".

So to me, the word "negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>" immediately conjured up ideas that I've also had for many years - which is to play every note of the chromatic collective EXCEPT C-E-G for example.

I can do that with DAWs now but I've yet to try. Maybe I'll get around to it one day. Might be a neat way to approach sound mass music.

I can see people doing goofy stuff like taking a Beethoven piece and "inverting" the pitches - include all notes NOT played at every given moment. Would be an interesting experiment - but you'd probably have to limit how many "other" notes you include.

I don't know anything about it other than seeing it here (for the first time in my life and I'm nearing 50) and having encountered so many "hey I've come up with a new method..." type posts from people over the decades that my philosophy is, if there's anything to it, it'll catch on. If not, it will vanish into obscurity.

I suppose our only additional element now is that the internet allows - I hate to say it - "viral" expansions. Unfortunately, that can not only make something spread wider and faster than it really deserves to, but it can also make something a "fad" more quickly. But again, hopefully maybe society can filter things in a way that meritorious things do get their place in the sun.

I don't know anything about "negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>" other than seeing the term and what you just described.

However - based on what you've described, it sounds like it's building off principles we also encounter in "positive <b><u>harmony</u></b>" if you like.

However however - those people are barking up the wrong tree as well. There are a lot of "harmonics chasers" and "tunings chasers" and so on out there.

I like to say it this way (just to needle people):

Harmonics are responsible for one thing in music: Timbre. Period.

And, when you look at actual music historically, one thing becomes abundantly clear: most of what has been done was done IN SPITE OF the harmonic series.

And "reverse engineering" things with flawed premises don't usually yield any accurate results. But people can get away with it becuase it's art, not science.

I'm not saying that's necessarily what's going on because I haven't investigated it, but all I know is Van Gogh probably really wasn't all too concerned about which wavelengths are present in Green. He just used some green paint, or knew he could mix blue and yellow, and got on with the process of making art.

And those who study art probably aren't too worried about it either. They're more interested in his mental state than any physics laws that describe primary or secondary colors.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Descending chromatic (or semi chromatic) bass line with same notes above.

Commonplace.

The 7th under the Bb doesn't really make it have a need to resolve in the traditional sense. If it did, it would usually go to G or Gb (Gb if in Bbm) and it does, so any sense of tension is resolved.

But we don't tend to hear progressions like this, like that. We hear instead a moving bass line under a static <b><u>harmony</u></b>. So it's not the 7th itself that's "driving" this IMHO, but the context of the bass moving while the other notes stay still.

"Chim Chim Cheree" from Mary Poppins.

Similar ideas abound in rock - especially with this kind of formula - Cream's "White Room" and "Tales of Brave Ulysses" both use Dm - C - G/B - Bb which often keep a D note on top or even more of the upper notes on top - so would translate to Dm - Dm7/C - Dm7/B (or B%7) and Dm/Bb (Bbmaj7).


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hmm.

Well, if you're writing "waltzes" in 6/8 meter, you're not writing waltzes.

Waltzes are in triple meter.

6/8 is duple meter.

You can even see this by the fact you're using dotted quarter + dotted quarter - you're only getting two beats per measure (at least that's what those notes would be implying and that *is* how 6/8 works in fact).

If you want a "traditional" waltz, then you should "halve" your 6/8 measures so they are 2 3/8 measures and treat each bar of 3/8 as if it were 3/4 and use it as 3 beats per measure, like waltzes are.

Honestly, that you're even asking this leads me to believe that you simply aren't familiar with music. Have you ever looked at a waltz by someone else? I mean, the answers you seek are right there in all the existing music.

Obviously (or it would be obvious to someone familiar with waltzes who've read them and paid attention to how they are accompanied) the "primordial" waltz accompaniment is, for lack of better terms:

"Boom Chick Chick" or "Oom Pah Pah"

Which is 3 quarter notes in 3/4, with Beat 1 being a lower bass note, and the "chicks" on Beats 2 and 3 being the remainder of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

By googling "waltz accompaniment" (images) I got the following results:

https://www.clementstheory.com/img/guides/waltz-of-the-flowers.png

http://mascaripianostudios.com/downloads/musictheory/jazzwaltz/JazzWaltzExample1.png

http://parrishpianostudios.com/FlareWeb/Resources/Images/waltzbass.gif

And about a million others that look similar.

The first variations of this "classic waltz patter" are to do things like:

1. Play the root of the chord on beat 1, then the remainder of the chord on beat 2, then a single different chord tone of the chord on beat 3 (preferable one that allows the bass line to move logically to the pattern as it repeats in the next measure.
2. Play the bass note on 1, and the rest of the chord on 2, holding it through beats 2 and 3 without playing any new sounds on beat 3.
3. Play the bass on 1, hold it through 2, and play the remainder of the chord on beat 3.
4. Add dotted notes - bass note on 1, chord on beat 2 as a dotted note for 1.5 beats (covering beat 2 and the first hald of beat 3) then either another chord or single note as above on the "and" of beat 3.

But writing a "waltz" in 6/8 is like writing a "march in 3/4 - it's only good for when the tripods attack.




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; When I listened to Ulysses it seemed there was a lot of importance on the fact that some things were moving and others weren't... the bassline was descending but the vocal line mostly used c# d#

Correct. What these things are "about" if you will is "moving part against static part".

I think trying to fit the square peg of "moving part against stating part" into the round hole of "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" can be an exercise in futility.

That's not to say that all such parts are non-functional, but most of them are not "about" the functionality.

Yes, it moves from I (or i) to bVI.

Sometimes, as in White Room, it goes back through bVII to get from bVI to I (i). So the bVI - bVII - I progression sort of becomes an analog to a functional progression (as in, those chords are acting like pre-dom, dom, and tonic).

But getting to the bVI is sort of "anti-functional" or what sometimes is referred to as a "retrogression" - moving away from I.

It's not unlike a pattern you encounter in functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> of:

i - v6 - iv6 - V7 - where the bass line (in Cm) would be:

C - Bb - Ab - G

This happens in functional tonal music, but it's considered as "moving away from I (to V)" so it's not a "progression" or functional.

But, when you get to the V, it's now a dominant (notice the first one is inverted, and minor so it's not acting as a dominant).

So the v6 and iv6 are considered more "linear" chords and less so functional in this context.

Sort of a similar idea in pop music is the "Sixteen Tons" type progression, also found in Stray Cat Strut and Hit the Road Jack, as well as being part of the Andalusian Cadence (which you hear in 60 western movie soundtracks a lot and in Surf):

I (i) - bVII - bVI - V(7)

So  again it's kind of heading to V and only the V back to I is deemed "functional".

This pattern seems to use that same idea with bVI as the "goal" chord - now some patterns like this do continue on to V (and some get all the way down to II to do a II-V-I to get us back) and in the case of something like White Room, it's the bVII that sort of becomes our dominant to take us back.

Best
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In Common Practice Period Tonality, and in musical styles prior to that, the chordal 7th was considered a dissonance that HAD to be resolved.

Thus, just adding a 7th to a chord made it resolve - quality didn't matter, and changing the quality (for example using a m7 chord where a maj 7 might have been used instead) didn't really affect its need for resolution though in some cases it could affect the possible chords it could resolve to.

In this broad time period, 7ths resolve down by step to the next diatonic note. Since the note it resolved down to could be the root, third, or 5th of the next chord (usually a dissonance doesn't resolve to another dissonance) you only had 3 viable chords of resolution.

By the time we get to the CPP specifically, one of those resolutions is far less commonplace, meaning essentially 7th chords resolve either up to a chord a tone higher, such as G7 - Am or G7 - Ab, or they resolved up a 4th such as G7 - C or G7 - Cm.

You can find 7ht chords that don't behave this way, but usually they are special types where the 7th is either not a chordal 7th or the chord itself is non-functional, but as a pretty steadfast over-reaching rule, this is how 7th chords behaved in the CPP.

After the CPP, all bets are off.

So, in Jazz, or in modern pop, or in any kinds of modern classical type music that uses <b><u>harmony</u></b> more freely and doesn't concern itself with how chords resolve, anything goes.

To be sure, people still use 7th chords as they did in the past, but they also use them "freely" as well. So in some contexts they resolve as they always would have, and in other contexts they don't resolve. Likewise, in those contexts where they resolve we usually consider them dissonances, but in other cases they're not treated like a dissonance.

We can say that taking a M7 and forming a 7 out of (Maj7 to Dom7 or Mm7) maybe gives the chord "more push" to resolve because there's a dissonant present in addition to the 7th (the tritone). So in some ways, the "more dissonant" the chord is, the more "energy" it has and a greater need to resolve.

A lot of people learn it this way which is applicable in many cases to contemporary music, but in CPP music, really the addition of the 7th is enough to make the chord need to resolve. So in some ways, a Maj7 is just as dissonant as a 7 or m7.

But yeah, if you take a 7 chord like G7 in the key of C and turn it into GMaj7, most would say you have "weakened" its dominant function (if not removed it altogether) and that sort of defeats the purpose (FWIW, something like this just wouldn't happen in CPP music).

But again, modern contemporary music ignores these kinds of things a lot of times so it can be a moot point in many contexts.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, what is the equivalent to:

The big, brown, ugly, _______

In this context, there's an expectation of something - the "noun" in this case - which is the "tonic".

The big, brown, ugly, dog.

Music and Language both have a time element - all of the information isn't given to us at once.

For visual media, film would make the most sense as it's easier to use things like establishing shots then a scene. A jump scare realized, or unrealized, are like Authentic and Deceptive cadences.

How do we do that in a still image?

Does it count if a Pumpkin is Blue in a painting.

I'm not sure it's possible without the time element, unless you're able to do something like show an image, followed by another image, followed by another image.

IOW, one still image is maybe more like a single chord, but FUNCTION has to do with movement from one sound to another.

It's possible we might say that the function of a single chord in isolation is clear if we know the Key (or at least pretty clear).

So a still image could be presented in a context where multiple interpretations are not possible (maybe easier for abstract art than representational art) and the "function" of the image might be pretty clear.

I mean, a simple portrait has a "function" on it's own as being a depiction of the person.

But it takes on a different meaning if you put it in a series of other portraits that have some "direction" apparent in them - which is more of what functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Why don't you look at a biography of John Williams and see how he did it.

That's how you do it. I mean, sure, modern times are a bit different but the idea of "self study" is unrealistic - that is, it would be fine if you want to compose like that but just sit around in your room and do it.

I think what most people don't understand is that while there are composers, or "composers" who sit around with a DAW assembling sounds and we hear them on major releases, the really good composers like John Williams of Michael Giocchino studied music at real deal music schools:

&gt;In 1948, the Williams family moved to Los Angeles where John attended North Hollywood High School, graduating in 1950. He later attended the University of California, Los Angeles, and studied privately with the Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.[11] Williams had originally briefly attended Los Angeles City College for one semester as the school had a Studio Jazz Band.[12] In 1952, Williams was drafted into the U.S. Air Force, where he conducted and arranged music for The U.S. Air Force Band as part of his assignments.[13]

&gt;In 1955, following his Air Force service, Williams moved to New York City and entered Juilliard School where he studied piano with Rosina Lhévinne.[11] During this time Williams worked as a jazz pianist in the city's many jazz clubs."

&gt;Giacchino began combining images and music at age 10, when he began creating stop-motion animation with homemade soundtracks in his basement. While in high school, an art teacher who mentored Giacchino recommended to his parents that he attend the School of Visual Arts in New York City. 

&gt;Giacchino enrolled at SVA, majoring in film production and minoring in history. During his final year at SVA, his instructor in film publicity announced an unpaid internship was available at Universal Pictures. Giacchino, who was the only one interested, obtained the six-month position, which he filled at night while attending school during the day and working at Macy's to pay his rent. He graduated from SVA in 1990 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, after which he took music classes at the Juilliard School.

These people are players first, who have the ability to get into great positions because of their playing ability. They are also good writers and arrangers and who show a lot of creativity that gets them noticed and again gets them into great positions because of that creativity.

What are you doing, right now, to get into Julliard? You may not know who Henry Mancini was, or who Tedesco was, but those were real deal legit composers that Williams studied with. Who are you taking composition lessons with?

Realistically, deadly honest, you need to be studying with Williams, or Giocchino, or maybe at least Elfman (or Steve Bartek who actually does all the heavy lifting).

Many of the great Hollywood composers started off as copyists for other composers.

You "work your way up".

But sitting in your room writing 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> is not going to get you there.

You need to go get a Composition degree at a superior institution, and/or study with a superior composer if you want to seriously pursue a career like these people.

And you need to do whatever it takes to get there. If you're still in high school, you need to be studying an instrument, taking any kinds of lessons you can with as many people as you can - 8 hours a day? Then spend that time being tutored by the very best professionals you can afford. Your grades need to be stellar so you have less trouble getting into a great college.

If there's some way you can get into a college music program, you need to do it. But let's just say, if you can't afford a great school, and you don't really play an instrument well, I think you can enjoy striving to achieve those goals, but if you don't have the resources, don't expect it to ever happen (then if it does, all the better!).

Sure, there may be counter-examples who are famous with little to no training and if you want to follow that path, then fine. But since you specifically mentioned Williams, there you go.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Easy. There's no such thing as an Em/C chord.

It's a CMaj7.

Maybe what you're missing is that the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is determined from both staves - all sounding notes. The RH and LH aren't really (or typically - there are a few rare exceptions) two separate things.

Furthermore, just because the RH plays something that could be an identifiable chord on its own that's different from the root or what the LH is doing, it doesn't make it a separate chord with a separate bass. If that "chord" can be subsumed into the bass note as some other named chord, then we usually do so.

So a "C#m" chord in the RH over an A bass is always subsumed into an Amaj7 chord.

It is possible to have things like F/G where it's *really* a G11 but F/G is a shortcut notation.

But if you've got a choice between a simple 7th chord name and a slash chord, you go with the simple 7th chord name.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The Bridge is in D Mixolydian.

It's totally OK to have one section in one mode and another section in some other mode.

It could be a borrowed chord, but you're probably doing it consistently it makes sense to say the whole section is in that mode.

Really, in practice, Melody and <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in a piece of music are drawn from the same Key or Mode.

While there may be chromatic or other borrowed elements in either, the notes for BOTH melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> are drawn from the Key or Mode.

So something that's in Mixolydian Mode would typically have both the chords and melody made up of notes from Mixolydian.

D - Em - F#o - G - Am - Bm - C

and

D-E-F#-G-A-B-C-(D)

Of course there can be exceptions (and other ways to use modes) but based on what you're describing that's what it sounds like is going on.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's hard to tell you without musical examples - a sound is worth a thousand words! And sorry but I don't feel like looking  a bunch up and linking to them.

Melody is the "tune" - the thing you sing - the thing you hum or whistle to yourself.

It's a succession of musical pitches (notes) one after another that produce a musical "line" that you can follow. If you sing "Happy Birthday to You" for someone, you're singing a melody. Same with "Three Blind Mice" or things like that - what you're singing is the melody. An instrument like a flute or a violin can play the notes for a melody as well. So when you hear something like a Violin Sonata, where the Violin plays along with the piano, often the Violin is playing a "line" - a succession of pitches that rise and fall in a manner not unlike words in a sentence - the notes are a "musical sentence" if you like.

Rhythm is the "time" element of music - WHEN things happen, and for how long. If you hear 4 notes in a row that are evenly spaced in time, that's rhythm. If you hear 3 notes in a row where one is 1 second and the other two are a half second each, that's rhythm. On one level, EVERYTHING in music has rhythm because it all happens in time. But when we say "the rhythm" we're often referring to a pattern that happens repeatedly - like a drum beat - where it repeats in the same pattern in such a way you could tap your foot to it or clap your hands to it.

A related term is "tempo" which refers to the pace of musical time - how fast or slow the beat is. Think of the Beat as graph paper - a grid - and the tempo as the sizing of the grid squares, and then filling in a square on the grid (to represent a musical sound) is rhythm. If you filled in every 4th square, you'd have a rhythm. If you filled in every square that started with a grid line, you'd have a rhythm that matched your beat and your tempo. But rhythms can be different from the beat - they could happen on the beat or in between beats and so on - so if your graph paper had one bold line on the grid every 4 boxes, that could represent a Beat, and any or all of those 4 boxes within that beat could have a note on them. That's your rhythm.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> is more than one musical pitch sounding at the same time (to make "chords"). When a group of people play or sing together, ,they're not all always playing the same note. One person may play an A note, and another may play a C note, and another an E note. These different notes, when played at the same time, all sound together and make "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" or a chord.

The word can also mean a few other things, but it may often refer to the other parts that accompany a melody - for example we may say "this is the <b><u>harmony</u></b> that goes with this melody". Or "the piano is playing the <b><u>harmony</u></b> while the violin plays the melody".

But the notes the melodic instrument plays also becomes part of the overall <b><u>harmony</u></b> - any notes sounding at the same time.

Texture refers to the way music is written - as either a single line melody, multiple melodies combining to make <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or notes played at the same time to make chords that accompany a melody. It can also mean the "density" of music.

Timbre is "tone color" - it's what makes a Flute sound like a flute and a clarinet sound like a clarinet.

If a flute and clarinet both play exactly the same note at exactly the same volume, we can still tell them apart - that's timbre.

It too can refer to just the 'tone color" of a single sound, but it can also be used to refer to something more general, like "orchestral timbre" where the number of instruments that are playing give a certain tone quality in contrast to another part of the music where a different group of instruments are playing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The Dorian Mode is like a Minor Scale with a raised 6th scale degree:

A Minor: A B C D E F G (A)

A Dorian: A B C D E F# G (A)

In a lot of modern music that uses a mode for the basis of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody, sometimes the 6th degree is highlighted becuase it's the the one thing that makes it decidedly "not plain old minor".

Ordinarily, if you'd want to write a piece in Dorian, you'd also use those chords that contain the raised 6th so again it's not confused with "plain old minor".

Chords in A Dorian would be:

Am, Bm, C, D, Em*, F#^o , G*

*in contemporary use of modes, the V and VII chords are often kept as their "modal" state rather than changing them to Dominant function chords as in traditional minor keys (where you'd use E and G#^o in Am for example) however in ancient modal music that pre-dates tonal music, the raised Leading Tone started being used pretty regularly - and it sometimes still is today in modal compositions.

Not that the II, IV, and VI chords are the ones that contain the raised 6 degree, so those become ii, IV, and vi^o - also, any sevenths added to chords would be F# instead of F in this key, so for example, VII would be VIIMaj7 as well.

To "use" this, many people will create a chord progression that maintains the "I" as the tonic, but also uses the ii or IV chords (the diminished one is usually avoided to prevent it from drifting to some other key).

A common "Dorian Vamp" is just i - IV and back and forth - "Oye Coma Va" by Santana Does this and would be a great song to get the Dorian feel in a pop song. All of the melodic material for soloing includes the F# so you can hear it in action pretty well (and Carlos Santana kind of emphasizes it).

Basically, for improvisation, you use the notes from A Dorian, and play those over a Dorian chord progression in A - this Dorian Vamp being one instance - a progression from Am7 to Bm7 vamping back and forth would be another place to use A Dorian Mode.

It is possible for the raised 6 degree to appear only in the melody, or only in the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but as long as it's the "main" 6th scale degree, we'd usually consider it Dorian all other things being the same.

Honestly, I think that thinking of modes as "rotations" of the Major Scale confuses a lot of people. They are, but it's really more practical to think of them in terms of their OWN tonic note (or final if you like, which is the term for a mode's "tonic"). IOW, rather than think of A Dorian as somehow being part of G, it's better to think of it as it's own A thing - and that is, a minor mode, so it's like A Minor, but with a raised 6th. Dorian is Minor with a Raised 6th (it's always raised a half-step).

You'll get more mileage out of it that way becuase they tend to be used musically, in context, in that way.

Likewise, it's not a great idea to think of Em as "coming from G" - yes the two are related, and yes it's a "mode" of G and so on, but in reality we treat Em as its own key historically. Referencing everything back to major may be useful in come cases, but it can also become a restriction to understanding things more musically.

A Dorian is its own thing.

I'm referencing it to minor as a memory aid, which I feel is more practical than referencing it to a major scale of which it's a rotation (couple more steps involved there) but ultimately, you should learn them as stand-alone entities not related to anything else, except in those circumstances where they are (there are pieces that do in fact use modes in a related fashion).

But for beginning, Dorian is Minor with a raised 6.

And you can start making music with it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Love this song.

I said this in a post earlier today - people just don't understand Non-Chord Tones, and it keeps them from understanding a lot of music.

It's simply I - IV - V - I and it makes perfect sense.

Either the B or the Bb is a Non-Harmonic Tone - a Pedal Tone.

G6 - CMaj7 - D7 (or D6 or D13 if you like).

To answer a later reply OP, not all notes are parts of chords. The "jazz mentality" (or maybe more accurately, the beginner mentality who gets information from jazz-oriented sources) is that all notes are always subsumed into a chord.

They don't have to be.

So you shouldn't be trying to "hear alterations" because that's not what they are.

It is "about" I - IV - V - I and the other notes are simply "incidental".

And historically, the number one most common thing to do when <b><u>harmony</u></b> was non-functional was to have a Sequence - it's as if the sequence "justifies" weird or unusual chord progressions (or other note choices).

@farcical_me is right on - the listener's ear is grounded through repetition.

And then there are non-chord tones - though I personally hear them as appoggiatura (on beat 2 consistently, so B is actually part of each chord).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's a sequence. In fact, the pattern you wrote out shows it (think of the first chord as F instead of Dm and you can see it even better).

Historically, Sequences in music basically "justify" things that might not otherwise happen.

IOW, usually we use functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> to "make sense" of things, but in the absence of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you usually need something else - some other kind of "logic" - one common thing is to have a pedal tone going under a bunch of unrelated chords to "ground" them.

Another is a sequential progression -the logic is the pattern itself.

In sequences like this it's actually better to think of them as referencing different keys so it's like a IV - I progression in C, then Bb, then Ab.

If you think of that, then you have a "key" progression that is built on a common chord progression - C - Bb - Ab - G (Cm or Gm as well).

IIRC, the melody is actually sequential as well, changing keys with the chord (making it a Real sequence versus tonal sequence - which are two terms you should look up for better understanding)


HTH

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No such thing a G# Major really - I mean it's theoretically possible but there's no key signature for it since it would contain double sharps.

Make life easy - it's Ab Major.

Are you saying it's G# - A# and C# (or Ab - Bb - Db)?

It's hard to say without context because it could be an A#m7 chord (or Bbm7).

It could also be a C#6 (Db6) without the 5th of the chord.

Bbm7/Ab or Db6/Ab are the two most "triadic" possibilities assuming the lowest note (G#/Ab) is NOT the root of the chord.

If G# is the "root", then it can't be "with the root absent" because the root is there...

If G# is truly the root, here are some things that might help you:

G#-A#-D# would be G#sus2 (or Absus2, etc.)

G#-C#-D# would be G#sus4

These are called "sus" becuase the number of the sus REPLACES the 3rd of the chord.

Since both are present, it could be:

G#sus2sus4 - which is a pretty cumbersome name, but really the correct one assuming G# is in fact the unquestionable root.

Alternatives would be to call it G#sus4(add9) or G#sus4(add2).

The 5th is usually present in chords like this but it could be dropped.

But remember, chord names are not meant to tell you that. So there's every possibility that if you write G#sus2sus4 it will be played:

G# - A# - C# - D#

The same is true for the others I've mentioned above - you could call it Bbm7/Ab and it's possible the 5th would be dropped - because it commonly is - giving you these exact notes (though duplicate octaves of them are likely to be played). You could also call it Db6/Ab but most people would add the F note in (which would make it sound far more like either of these two options than some chord with an Ab/G# root).

But who's going to read this and play it?

The whole point of giving it a name would be to tell someone else what to play.

How would I notate it? With notes. Then this problem is solved.

This could also potentially be a Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> chord, which we don't have any universally recognized naming conventions for.

So you need to decide WHY you're even bothering to name it - are you expecting someone to look at a chord name and play exactly this voicing? Sorry, that ain't gonna happen because that's now how players do this.

If you want specific notes, the best way is to write them down specifically.

Steely Dan famously (infamously?) came up with "Mu Minor" for a chord they used often but really didn't know the name for, just so they could communicate to others some name for what they were playing.





</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The image leaves a lot to be desired.

In **Jazz** Tonic function is often assigned to iii and vi in addition to I.

However, I never really get why they say that because almost always, in anything related to Jazz you'll hear things the say essentially that the 7th chord is the "base" unit of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, not triads.

So if you get a iii, it's because someone's treating it as the upper part of a IMaj7. Likewise if you get a vi, it's the other primary jazz tonic triad - I6 (like C6).

They are also "substitutes". Since this is a guitar chart, a lot of guitarists think like "the chord is C, but I can play an Em triad because it makes it Cmaj7 - and the bass player is taking the C".

So in their mind, the "chord shape" is an Em, not a Cmaj7.

In Classical Music - and honestly, in Rock/Pop that's not jazz, there ain't but one tonic - I.

In minor, it's i, in major, it's I. The Tonic chord is the tonic, and that's it (there are exceptions such as ambiguous or dual tonics, or music without tonics altogether and so on).

iii is sometimes seen as a "tonic prolongation" but it is also its own chord. vi is especially it's own chord, often with little do with any Tonic-ness.

We call them the "variable" or "mediant" class in those cases.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br><b><u>Harmony</u></b> outweighs the melody in most typical contexts.

In fact, it's doubtful that the melody is actually in major, it's just that people think it is becuase most people have been taught a "major-centric" way of looking at things, so they'll look at some music an basically assume it's major and then only change to minor if there's some evidence to do so.

So a minor key melody could absolutely look like the relative major (because they're the same especially if the LT is not used in minor) and even by itself - without the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - it could even sound like major and otherwise be assumed to be without any further context.

But if you put a minor key chord progression (from the relative minor) under "Three Blind Mice" it's going to make it sound minor.

Now you're talking about something slightly different it seems though - songs can MODULATE - change key - and they can absolutely start in Eb and modulate to the relative minor, C minor.

And there are a lot of pop tunes that use the relative keys in such a way that neither of them comes out as the primary key - kind of a "dual key" - verses are in minor, choruses are in major, or something like that.

Usually in those cases, if either one happens more, we pick that, or if the choruses are major and seem more significant in the song, we pick that. Otherwise we might pick the one it begins or ends on, and if one key both begins and ends it, that's the more likely choice. Though also, because so many people are so "major-centric", they'll just pick major regardless.

You said it uses C Minor Pentatonic - but remember that's Eb Major pent as well - so if the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is Eb at the beginning, it's playing the same notes as Cm pent, but it's *really* EbM pent.

It sounds like this one might be mostly in Cm, then moves to EbM, in which case the melody over the Cm key is Cm, and then it's EbM over that section - IOW, we don't typically say a melody is in one thing while the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is in another - they are inter-dependent and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is really the guide.

There can be times when we might want to describe a melody as being some different scale just to point out the pattern, but otherwise it's typically whatever key the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is.

Now there is experimental music, and more complex music where this may not apply (bi-tonality - two keys at once, modal chord-scale use in jazz, etc.) but for most typical songs, the melody's key is dictated by the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yep, "close vocal harmonies".

Some young hip people might call them "tight vocal harmonies" - which could mean other things though.

Jazz vocal groups tend to include a lot of 2nds in their voicings because they're doing 7th and 9th chords, etc.

Rock vocals on the other hand tend to stick more to thirds and triads, though they may have sus2 and sus 4 voices in there.

One other factor that might make some things sound more "close" than other things is the vocal timbre and possible overall range - for example, the band Boston, Brad Delp did all the harmonies himself and he's got a lot of really closely spaced chords (with some sus2s and stuff in there) and since they're both high and the same vocal timbre, they tend to sound "tighter" - more of a single unit - than say a band where it's a little easier to pick out the individual voices - like The Beatles.

Most of the 50s and early 60s "Doo-Wop" groups do tight vocals, although in some cases they have either a high lead (Lion Sleeps Tonight) or a low Bass voice - this sort of comes out of the Barbershop Quartet practice (as do a capella jazz vocal groups).

Some bands with mixed male and female singers may also not sound like they're as close but they can be - someone like Manhattan Transfer for example.

One interesting band is Fleetwood Mac, where Lindsey Buckingham could actually sing higher than the girls in the band, so they're layout is reversed from what most people did - Stevie Nicks on a low note, Christine McVie on the next note up, then Buckingham on the high note.

Some bands like Eagles use a high falsetto voice on top (as do a lot of country and bluegrass bands - and bluegrass and the southern gospel tradition in a good place to look).

The Beach Boys are probably THE vocal <b><u>harmony</u></b> band - with groups like Eagles, Crosby, Stills and Nash, and The Beatles coming close (for using different voices, not the same person overdubbed like Boston).

Queen has some great stuff - ever hear of a little ditty called "Bohemian Rhapsody"?

In R&amp;B, there are plenty of groups like Take 6:

so that might be a good place to start looking.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It sounds to me like you think you want to write music that's never been written before, using materials that are part and parcel of older music, while dealing with the "but this sounds like something else" dilemma.

I don't know what to tell you other than it's kind of a catch-22 and a "you're overthinking it" kind of issue.

If you listen to Gesualdo, you'll hear the same kinds of things his contemporaries were doing, but some chord progressions that are totally out compared to what everyone else was doing so it has this duality of sounding perfectly of its time, yet oddly out of place - and from our perspective, even "forward-looking".

And what's interesting about it is it's the same basic material that classical composers and rock players use - basic triads - chromatic mediants - but what's interesting is HOW those chord progressions are used.

There's a lot of great writing in the 1960s that I really like in TV and Film where "rock" music elements are being combined with jazz and traditional romantic/classical and even contemporaneous experimental techniques, including electronic music and musique concrete, and interestingly, it can incorporate earlier historical things without necessarily directly referencing older styles (though obviously in TV in Film they intentionally mimic, parody, or even copy older styles for certain settings and effects).

It truly was one of the most eclectic styles of writing and really hasn't been surpassed. If you think about a lot of the James Bond scores (especially the earlier ones) or if you know it, the Get Smart, Man From UNCLE, or The Avengers type themes and music, or Ennio Morricone's Good Bad and Ugly and Dollars movies - there's this really interesting mix of a lot of genres we might even call "Eclecticism" as a movement/style.

IN the case of Morricone - like the Good Band and Ugly soundtrack - it really gives you a very "new" and "fresh" sound at the time - and even today (though some elements have become clichéd by Hollywood's constant copying of them - such as the Chime (Bell) in western movies). What's always struck me about the GBU music is the chords are pretty simple, as is the melody, but there are these non-traditional aspects about it - and then most importantly - the kind of orchestration that was happening the "yodel", the vocal "grunts", the guitar - in some ways the music is very basic but the orchestration makes it really unique and while now we can say some of those elements are typical of the time, they're actually still not really replicated today in all the "epic" junk out there.

I think you're looking for what a lot of people are looking for.

Many of them turned to atonality, many to jazz, many to quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, many to microtonal music, many to sound mass, and so on.

I've heard some very contemporary orchestral writing that kind of does what you describe, though it's not "chordal" or "harmonic" in the traditional sense.

And I think that might be part of your issue here it's like you're saying "I want to use Jazz chords but not have it sound Jazzy". Well, that's kind of hard to do because of our experience. We're going to associate them with that because that's how we reference them. Heck people even go "Debussy sounds really jazzy" - yeah, he does now after we've been exposed to that sound - but at the time it would have been just totally new and different.

I think you might be setting up unattainable goals for yourself - I mean you can absolutely develop your own style - but, like Schoenberg, you might have to make a complete break with something rather than try to expand on an existing thing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, my first recommendation if you haven't already done so, is listen to as much music as you can that uses set theory (ignoring that all music could theoretically be considered set theory - I'm talking about post-tonal music of course).

It sounds like to me - as a reader on the outside looking in - you discovered set theory and now you want to try and use it, without actually knowing how to use it or what it's even used for.

It's really hard to give advice becuase - think of it this way:

"Hello, I have questions about using tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> to write music. I've recently heard about how chords are made by stacking every other note, and you can use different permutations to make inversions, and you can retrograde the set or interval content to produce different quality chords, but I'm not sure how to use tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> to make music".

We'd probably think that was silly, becuase the first answer would be - listen to - and learn to play - music. Traditional music is tertian-based and if you just work with it a bit, you get it.

It's also kind of like picking up an automatic framastat and saying, "I'd like to build a house using this tool, but I don't know how it works or what's the point of even using it to build a house".

I wish, we could consider things like this like deadly pathogens - you should be playing with it if you don't know what it does. Of course obviously, it's not dangerous, but really, it's kind of like when they made you write Sonnets in school - they teach you about iambic pentameter, and rhyme scheme, and the number of lines and the form, but if you haven't read a lot of sonnets, what you write is going to be a pretty poor imitation of a sonnet - that only resembles a sonnet in those spec aspects.

IOW, even a person using a major scale and diatonic chords doesn't necessarily guarantee good music - and it especially doesn't do so if they're not real familiar with music that uses major scales and diatonic chords.

So I would say if you're interested in using it, then really dig into the kind of music that uses it - otherwise you're just doing a poor facsimile of it.

That also doesn't mean it's not a valid tool, but it's a tool that works best if you know what to use it for, and when to use it, and ultimately how you might be able to use it in other ways - but you kind of have to learn the right way to use it first before you go trying to hammer nails in with Vise Grips.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Where can i learn about <b><u>harmony</u></b> and orchestration?

From actual music.

I know this is going to sound absolutely insane, but the way to learn MUSIC is from MUSIC.

Learn to play music by other people, tear it apart, figure out how it works, and then try to make stuff that sounds like it.

The answers are in the music itself.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>A lot of people who take piano lessons (and some on other chordal instruments) are taught "I - IV - V" as the "pillars" of Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and often play "I - IV6/4 - I - V6 (or V6/5) - I" like C - F/C - C - G7/B - C. Consequently they're told the sort of "main progression" towards a cadence is IV - V - I.

IT'S A LIE!!!!!

In Tonal music, yes there is a BASS movement of 4-5-1, but the harmonies that use those notes are almost always ii^6 - V - I  (like Dm/F - G - C)

IV is actually kind of an "underdog".

But, both ii^6 and IV have a "similarity of sound" and they both function as "pre dominant" chords.

ii does occur in root position, but often in a 5th relation to vi or V, but even then, ii^6 is super common.

It's almost safe to say that, generally speaking, ii^6 is PREFERRED over root position ii (this is also because in minor, ii is a diminished chord and it appears almost exclusively in first inversion).

The B diminished chord that leads to the Cm/Eb chord (ii^6 again) is a "Secondary Dominant" (or more specifically, secondary leading tone chord).

Usually, that D/F# chord would appear as a Secondary Dominant as well and would usually go to the vi chord (Gm) but here it has a "common tone diminished 7th" relation to the B diminished chord. It's kind of unusual in this context, but it connects the chords here chromatically which has its own logic to it.

I should note that ct^o7 chords became more common through the Romantic period, but composers starting about with Chopin started doing a lot more "non-functional" progressions and throwing out rules and unifying music in other ways (such as chromatic voice-leading).

So sometimes, you're going to see stuff in Chopin and later composers which doesn't conform to "standard" theory concepts. But things like Secondary Dominants and Common Tone Diminished 7ths are actually "standard" theory - it's just that most people who only study theory in a cursory manner often don't get to them (or Borrowed Chords as well).

 no offense, but the "b" for inversions worries me - my experience with it tends to indicate the people are in pre-college theory course - and it's OK on some level, but the people I've spoken to about it said they went on to learn "proper" inversion symbols anyway so I say why not go ahead and do it now (though of course if you're in a class you have to do what's required).

Simply put:

Root Position = I = I for you.

First Inversion = I^6 = Ib for you.

Second Inversion  = I6/4 = Ic for you (I think I have that right).

6/4 is written with the 6 superscript and the 4 immediately below as subscript, kind of like:

6

4

You can see also that in some cases, the letters can be confused with other letters in text-based communication, so most people either aren't familiar with the "a b c" inversions, or stop using it once they learn the numerals.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>While there can be crossover, Jazz <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and "Classical" <b><u>Harmony</u></b> can really be quite different in the way <b><u>harmony</u></b> is used.

I have to say I think your statement that it has never been as rewarding as you'd hoped is actually quite true - because I think a lot of people think it's supposed to "answer" things, but really it's more of just "describing" things.

But you are absolutely right about generalizing through interpretation.

I guess what I would say is, you can't necessarily use the same approach with a Jazz piece that you do with Chopin or Ravel. But you are right - Jazz often - not always - but often (as part of the core) does approach chord progressions as you interpret. But Chopin and Ravel, and Debussy, and Liszt, and Rachmaninov - they're coming from a different (and earlier) tradition.

My advice is always, learn to play the music, listen to it, tear it apart, identify things, and try to recreate it.

And Bach is very different than Chopin (for the most part). I think there's a big misunderstanding most people have - and that's that they think because different styles use similar materials - notes, chords, etc. that they all "operate" the same. But they don't - a Chopin Waltz is really quite different from a Bach Chorale - it's probably closer to some Jazz Waltzes.

I would say, just immerse yourself in this music until you "intuit" it. That'll go a long way towards getting you more in tune with what is, and what isn't commonplace in the style.

Cheers
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Wow, this is kind of a tough one to tackle.

You should be losing confidence in the validity of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> as the main system for musical analysis not because of your perceived interpretation of "subdominant area" but becuase it's an outdated musical style.

Firstly, let's dispel the Plagal Cadence thing. Plagal Cadences are part of the MODAL system, not TONAL system and they just aren't part of the style. They're used when a composer wants to hearken back to an ancient tradition, such as an "Amen" cadence. It's not unlike today how a songwriter might hearken back to an ancient tradition by using a Phrygian Half cadence in some modern pop song - it's not part of the modern vocabulary - it's "old fashioned" and meant to sound that way (or the incorporation of Gregorian Chant-like elements into modern pop, etc.).

Secondly, Circle of 5ths has NOTHING to do with chord progressions. That's a gross misunderstanding largely dropped on us by well-meaning jazz players who attempted conflate KEY RELATIONSHIPS with chord progressions. They are NOT the same thing. Personally, I don't even like calling chord progressions that do follow the Circle of 5ths "Circle of 5ths" progessions and prefer something like "Cycle of 4ths" because really, it's got nothing to to with nothing.

Granted "5th relatedness" is an important factor in both chord progressions and key relationships, but they really are two different things and should not be conflated.

"The undertone series"? Gobbledygook.

I think, the issue here might be that you're being taught "classical" theory by "jazz" theorists. Now that's not meant to be insulting but I'm using those terms just as generalities to show that there's a different thought process going on and you approaching one style with the concepts of another style isn't going to be as informative as you like.

The factual basis you're looking for is IN THE FREAKING MUSIC!

It is clear, for example, that many pieces have sections in the Tonic Key, then modulate to the key of the Dominant, then often back to the Tonic, but for some final section - be it a full fledged section or a coda, etc., there will be a modulation to the Sub-Dominant Key Area. This is true of a lot of ternary form pieces and is common in Waltzes and Marches (I have tons of Classical Guitar pieces that do this) but again it also happens in codas - which some equate to an extended "Plagal Cadence" (which people like to equate things like that but I take it with a grain of salt).

I think one thing that's worth making clear is that there's a difference between a CHORD, a FUNCTION, and a KEY AREA. IV chords certainly exist. They're in the music! Subdominant Function certainly exists - it's in the music (but it's not necessarily a IV chord!). And modulations to the Key of "4" certainly exist in the music.

It's the interpretation of what these things are that seems to be suspect - but delineating between them can be a helpful first step.

But you know, all this stuff wasn't really all that helpful to Lassus, or Stravinsky, or Coltrane, or Hendrix.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say it wasn't all that helpful to Bach, Beethoven, or Brahms either.

TL/DR- theorists have a knack for making up stuff that doesn't really exist. But, they have an even better knack for conflating things that do exist with other ideas that have no relation.

Grain of salt.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't know that this is the best thing for you to do for writing music.

It's like you're trying to *justify* what you're doing - or in a way, saying to yourself, "ok, if I can explain it as coming from X mode then it's OK" - as if, the contrary - if you can't explain it you might not use it - which would be limiting.

Really, here's a simpler and more effective way to look at it:

1. Most chords come from C Major or C Minor:

Cm - Cm

C - C

Do - Cm

Dm - C

Eb - Cm

Em - C

Fm - Cm

F - C

Gm - Cm

G - C

Ab - Cm

Am - C

Bb - Cm

Bo - C

2. This actually covers all the chord roots except Db and F#/Gb

Db traditionally is the Neapolitan and needs no other explanation. It could "come from" Phrygian if you like, but we actually have both Major and Minor bII chords historically (though the minor one is excruciatingly rare) so there's not really any need to invoke a Mode.

Gb Major could be produced by Locrian. There's no diatonic mode for Gbm.

3. The other chords that are "opposite" of the mode can either be accounted for Modally, or just as "color chords", assuming they're not secondary dominants.

D - C Lydian

Ebm - C Locrian

E - ?

F#m - ?

Abm - ?

A - ?

Bbm - C Phrygian

Bm - C Lydian

B - ?

Some could be accounted for with, say, modes of Harmonic or Melodic Minor.

A great examples is, you can't produce an + triad with the diatonic notes. So people invoke Harmonic minor to show it can be made from a familiar scale.

Ok, but that's not where it "comes from" and nor is it the way it's used in music.

We have chords like the Augmented Sixth family of chords that don't "come from" any scales - they're just a chord - a collection of notes. But we use them. 

So, IOW, there's no need to "justify" or feel you should or should not use some <b><u>harmony</u></b> becuase it may or may not come from some familiar mode of some familiar scale.

And what difference does it make? There's no reason to even bother about this at all. I suppose if someone comes up to you and says "where did you get that chord" you might feel obligated to sound smart and explain it as some kind of borrowing, but the real answer should be "I liked the sound of it" no matter where it came from.


Finally, I'm assuming from the way you worded your post you're talking about "one off chords", not writing in a particular mode.

Obviously, if you're in C Dorian, and you use Bb, Gm, F, and Dm chords, all those should be explained as coming from that mode - IOW you wouldn't say the F is borrowed from C Ionian, the Dm from C Ionian, the Gm from C Aeolian, and the Bb from C Mixolydian.

So compositionally speaking, you usually don't want to just grab chords from modes willy nilly - usually you're borrowing back and forth between Major and Minor (traditional) or using some chord that brings in a particular character - like a "Phrygian Character" - which the tell tale chords would be those including b2, not just any other chord that might also appear in Major or Minor.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>While there are many who seem to think that Western music is "more effective" because it developed <b><u>harmony</u></b>, I personally would never say such a thing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>u/iafoma01 hit the nail on the head.

OK, in COMMON PRACTICE PERIOD music, there is no "harmonic minor scale" in the way everyone is taught.

There is the minor KEY.

In minor keys you raise scale degree 7 for HARMONIC reasons. And those reasons are to create a Leading Tone to give two chords DOMINANT function - V and viio.

But you DO NOT raise 7 and "play in harmonic minor". That's a modern misconception (though there is music from the modern era written this way - misinterpretation or not - so it does apply in that context).

If you add a 7 to i, you do not make it imM7. It's the "natural" state. And likewise, you don't raise it on a III chord. There is no CmM7 in Cm, and there's no Eb+. 

You raise it on the G and Bo chords only.

The Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor "scales" are not really scales at all, but just mnemonic devices to show concisely what is really a much bigger concept. Ever wonder why the Melodic Minor is different going up than going down? That's because it's *not really* a "scale", but trying to show you a concept - that in minor KEYS, the 6th and 7th may be altered for MELODIC purposes, and when they are, they are raised ascending, and lowered descending.

Bach never wrote in "melodic minor" or "harmonic minor".

He wrote in "minor" and adjusted scale degrees 6 and 7 for either harmonic or melodic purposes.

Now, Jazz is totally different, but if you're talking about traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and traditional keys, then III+ doesn't really exist in any practical manner.

It's not "theoretically correct". It's a misinterpretation.

What you want is what's STYLISTICALLY CORRECT, which is also what's HISTORICALLY CORRECT!

As another add on to what iofoma01 said, I used to tell my students that, in Major keys, they may only use the iii chord 4 times per semester. Because that's how rare it is in actual music (CPP music). III in minor (bIII) needed to be used with caution as it causes the music to drive back to the relative major.

Don't use iii or III (bIII) without a darn good reason, and make sure you understand it as they said. Don't use III+ (bIII+) at all unless it's Jazz - and even then, it needs to be used stylistically.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'd be curious why you think this.

Sure, one could easily argue that it's 2018 and we shouldn't even be teaching tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> anymore, or requiring Beethoven in the repertoire, but that is what it is.

And given that, your first years of study are hardly a "joke". Maybe for someone who either knew it all already, or thinks they know it all, or the entertainer who wants to do a totally different style of music, or the person who graduated with a degree but now works at Autozone who didn't understand that what they were being offered would give them opportunities that others would not have access to - sure it may have been a joke to those people.

But for people interested in the serious study of an albeit archaic style of music, as well as some other historically important styles or various types, if one approaches it as a joke, that's all one will get out of it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The way many people see Pentatonic is equivalent to Flat Earthers - no reason or logic other than made up to support their arguments.

If you want to learn about the Pentatonic Scale, you should do historical research and not just believe everything you read online. There are many types of anhemitonic scales, of which Pentatonics make up a decent number, but within that number are many types of Pentatonic scales. We (Western European musical tradition) use 2 commonly (one of which could be seen as a "mode" of the other).

But they are rarely used alone in most of the music most people are familiar with - most of the time the Pentatonic scales are treated as sub-sets of the diatonic collective rather than a source of musical material.

In a broad sense, you could say that we take 7 notes, and use 3 to make a <b><u>harmony</u></b> - a "tertiatonic scale", and when making a melody, we can take 7 notes and restrict them to 5 - a "penatonic scale". And while it's more likely a melody might be pentatonic rather than diatonic, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is still almost always diatonic in these types of pieces (IOW, not counting stricter use of Penatonic as in Debussy, or "riff-based rock" uses).

It's all about restricting the 7 note set (or presenting only certain notes at certain times) to get particular "flavors" melodically and harmonically.

But in those cases, the Penatonic is really a derivative of the diatonic set, or better, the Key. It's still tied to tonal tradition - not some other independent invention that's stuck in there. Granted it does exist in earlier music as well as in other cultures - but you have to watch out when people say that some other culture used a "pentatonic scale" because in most cases they've left something out that makes it a different type of pentatonic or made up something to make it pentatonic to support their claim that it's the "origin" of everything.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>People think it sounds all smart to call them Ionian and Aeolian, but 99% of the time it's just plain old Major and Minor.

C major and A minor are RELATIVE keys, meaning they share the same notes (and key signature).

What's difference is where the EMPHASIS is placed musically.

If a song is in C Major, you solo in C major.

The notes of Am will be the same notes so you could use them, but often when this happens someone is orienting their brain to A, meaning if they do something like "play a scale" they'll start on an A instead of C which might not go along with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> as well.

A Minor = A Aeolian.

I think there can be an important disctinction if were trying to specifically say that a minor key piece avoids all the typical and traditional "minor KEY" baggage - then we call it Aeolian to highlight this distinction.

But most of the time when someone here says Aeolian, they are just using it because they think they're supposed to and Minor is a better description.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you don't know jack, the first thing I would tell you is that a lot of people seem to think chord progressions are somehow more important then they really are - they're not really all that important and there's no great "theory" thing happening with them.

So for example, if someone plays C - C# - Gb - F as a chord progression, it's weird, uncommon, and will probably sound as such, but when people in forums like this ask "what's the theory behind..." - there is no theory behind it. It's "I like how those chords sounded in that order" and that's it.

Thus the "Same for chords" (I've recently heard them called the "Axis Progression" in honor of the Axis of Awesome video that brought them to prominence) is the same thing - someone liked the sound of those chords in that order.

There is no theory to explain either one, or why someone chose either one. In one, someone might have been trying to be intentionally different and in another case someone might have said, "hey, go with what you know works" and that's about the extent of it.

So really, the chord progression is generally a moot point.

Or IOW, trying to "fancy up" the chord progression by adding additional chords, or remote chords, or adding extensions to all the chords, and so on, doesn't make it "better" nor is there any "theory behind it" other than "it's the sound I wanted" or "it sounded cool".

So I would say, don't look to chord progressions as any measuring stick for "advances in theory" for popular music (or any music). 

Now CREATIVITY is a different issue - which can have to do with artistic/musical/technical elements that can include theoretical concepts.

Mainstream music tends to "de-volve" in the creativity aspect, especially the more commercialized it becomes. And currently, the focus in creativity tends to be in production rather than composition.

But there are certainly genres of music doing creative things that involve "more advanced <b><u>harmony</u></b>" and scales, rhythms, and what not. A lot of the Neo-Soul kind of stuff I hear is very interesting musically - a lot of young artists - Black artists especially - are looking back before pre-rap and pre-hiphop music styles where playing instruments was more important than coming up with a beat and sampling everything. And there's all kinds of Math Rock and still "Prog Rock" as well as a lot of "Fusion" styles that incorporate jazz and even classical elements that can be seen as "more advanced". And a lot of "world music" is gaining wider audiences and while there's a lot of American Chart musical influence (such that you hear Hindi Gangster Rap or something) but I'm hearing a lot of cool musics from around the world with greater melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic variety than "pop songs" at least here in the US.

So I wouldn't want to condemn pop music as a whole, and there's certainly a lot of cool stuff going on - in many different ways - you just have to dig for it.

Unfortunately, there's no mainstream movement to bring that cool stuff to the populace's attention - at least in the old days we had Radio and everyone listened to the same basic stuff. Sure it was limited and filtered by the stations and record companies, but at least it wasn't the corporate radio "same thing on every local station" we have now, and everything else just hiding in the web only known to people who seek it out and share it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I was referring to the scale only, not the <b><u>harmony</u></b> beneath it in that context.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Trouble ;-)

OK, seriously, in most contexts it means playing X scale over Y chord.

Sometimes it can be X and X - like playing a G Major Scale over a G Major Chord.

But in a piece in G Major, you could totally be playing a G Major Scale while the C chord (which is in the key) is sounding.

But the reason I said "trouble" only half-jokingly is that's it's a bad way to think about music - or at least, a limiting way to think about music.

And another use of the concept is in so-called "Chord-Scale" theory or playing where things get a lot more confusing (involving modes, and synthestic scales, etc.).

What most people want to do is play IN A KEY. Which means the notes from the key are used for BOTH your <b><u>HARMONY</u></b> and your MELODY. Sure we can list the notes of a key in order giving us a scale, but really you're (or you should be) drawing your notes from the notes of the KEY, not just "playing scales" which ends up sounding like someone is just running scales up and down rather than playing any melodies.

There are some exceptions like the already mentioned playing a blues scale over another chord, but really, unless it's more modern Jazz (like since the 60s) it's better to think of Keys and key centers rather than running scales.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; I realized after a while that I was so hung up on the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, that I neglected all the other aspects of the song, like arranging, mixing, tone, etc... So I decided it was best to write some simple songs, just to get something going. Surprisingly, some complex chords started popping up in the compositions, but in a natural way, not for the sake of it.

Quoted for truth!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not quite.

Its F#m - B then the same thing just a step up, G#m - C#

It's just a "sequence". A "II-V" progression repeated a step higher.

Very often it goes right back down to the original II - V instead of IV-V.

You've probably heard it in some show tunes or jazz standards.

I can hear it as coming from somewhere else too but can't think of what it is.

Your notes should be E - D# - D (natural) - C# for the melody notes and that would make it F#m7 - B(7) though thus Sus4 really clashes with the D# on the beat - but if the E holds over then resolves it makes more sense. Same for the next two but the D absolutely doesn't go - it would be D# instead as part of the G#m chord.

Remember, not all chords have to come from the key.

But if you like, historically, Sequential progressions are allowed more freedom to "not follow the rules" becuase the sequence itself has its own logic about it that can over-ride any functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>A Key has 7 notes.

From those 7 notes, we can produce <b><u>harmony</u></b>, most commonly (or basically) as traids on each scale degree.

C Major:


C D E F G A B

Chords in C Major:

C  Dm  Em  F  G  Am  B^o

BUT, there are two Keys that share the same note content, one major, and one minor, for each set of 7 notes. And there are 15 distinct sets of 7 notes producing 15 Key signatures that can represent a Major or Minor Key.

So there is at least 1 different note between any two major, or minor, keys.

We "neuter" keys by using Roman Numerals to talk about the harmonies so we can see commonalities across various keys.

But, for ANY Major Key, the pattern of chords (as given in the example on C Major above) is ALWAYS:

I - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - vii^o

Uppercase is Major, lowercase is minor, and the last one is diminished.

So when you have a chord progression, you have to "fit" the chords into this pattern above. If they fit, you're in a key, if they don't, one or more chords are from some other key.

Your progression has C, D and Em. So we need to look for a place in the key where there's a Major Chord, then another Major Chord a step higher, then a Minor chord a step higher.

The only place in a Major key that there are two majors in a row (a step apart) is between IV and V.

So that would mean C would be IV, and D would be V.

So if, vi is a minor chord, then we know we have a key - and since vi is a step higher than V, and Em could be "6" if C is "4" and D is "5", it fits:

I - ii - iii - IV(C) - V(D) - vi(Em) - vii^o

So now we have to backtrack to see what chord "one" would be.

IV - C, so iii - Bm, ii - Am, and I will be G.

So this MIGHT be the key of G.

But, because each Key signature (and set of 7 distinct notes) can be ONE OF TWO possible keys, we need to check to make sure that there isn't a minor key that makes more sense.

Minor keys go like so:

i - ii^o - III - iv - v* - VI - VII*

(in common practice period music, and still some today, v and VII are almost always replaced by V and vii^o, but we'll ignore that for now and try "natural minor" as it's called)

So can we find M-M-m in a row (since the letters are C-D-E)?

Well, "6" and 7" are both major, so that would mean C would have to be VI, D would be VII, and that would make Em i. That fits too.

So the question is, is it G Major or E Minor?

Well, are there any G Major chords?

Are there any E Minor chords?

There's your answer (a more complex answer is, you need to find a chord that sounds like "home" in the progression, but if the "home" chord it not present, there's a pretty good chance it's not actually the home chord).

_______________

Another way to figure this out it to look at the note content - and know your keys! C-E-G, D-F#-A, E-G-B.

So we have A-B-C-D-E-F#-G. What key is that? Well it's got one sharp only, and the Key Sig that has only F# is the one for G Major or E minor. So it's one of those two. Which one sounds like "home"? Which one makes more sense?

You guessed D - but not all chord progressions have to start on the "one" chord.

However, there exists "modes" which are like major and minor keys but the notes have been rotated. But you don't need to go there unless you feel like the D chord is really "home".

__________

D - A - D - Bb - If you try my first method with this, you'll find if you try D Major or A Major, the Bb won't fit in either. There is no key with a Major chord on the note a half step up from "one". There's also none with a Major "one" chord AND a major VI chord (on a note that's a half step higher than 5).

Your assumption is right - this is a "borrowed" chord or an example of "Mode Mixture" - borrowing from the "Minor Mode" to use in the "Major Mode".

So the key is likely D Major - that would make D 1 and A 5, and since I and V are both major chords in a major key, they fit.

It could be A Major, and A is 1 and D is IV.

It could also be B Minor and F# minor based on that. Are there any B Minor or F# minor chords? No? Then it's probably not those.

But how do we decide which of the other two it might be?

We look for supporting evidence.

Which chord sounds like "home" - if the D, then probably it's D, if the A, A.

Since it also begins on D, and has two D chords total, that's even more support.

Finally, the Bb chord is in neither A Major or D Major.

But it IS in D MINOR. So that's most likely where it comes from.

It is possible it's the "Neapolitan" which is bII from A Major (bII appears in both the Major and Minor modes) but it's much rarer and if there's enough evidence for D already, D is probably the safer bet.

Not sure what you mean by D5# - that's not standard nomenclature.

Is it a D5 with a #5?

If so, that's a Bb chord again - it's a Bb with a D in the bottom or Bb/D.

Melody, or rather ALL of the other notes that are sounding is important as well, and might change some of these. Which means another very important thing is CONTEXT!

So just listing chords might sometimes look like they're in X key, but hearing them in context might show that one is emphasized a lot more than the simple list points out, so we hear that as "home" and need to re-orient our thinking. So your very first one - *looks* like Em, but, it could be D Mixolydian if the D is emphasized in some way in the context. That's why the other post gave two options (though Em would be a better assumption than G Major). Given that it both starts and ends on a D chord, and there are more of those, and the other section looks like it's in D as well, it very well may be D Mixoldyian - we'd have to hear it to be sure.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are no "rules".

If you want to create a similar effect, just use a similar device.

Sequences can be a melody, a <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or both the melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>. So it could be a melody, but it could be a chord progression.

And you can have a sequential chord progression without the melody necessarily being sequential as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Honestly, IMHO, it's about SOUND, not "rules".

I don't consider this to be "evil" or anything - it's maybe more complex than I - IV - V, but it's not like it's atonal or anything.

In some ways it's not unlike what some people called "wrong note <b><u>harmony</u></b>" in a lot of pandiatonic music (though this is somewhat "panchromatic" if we like).

Basically, it's a "normal" chord, with a few "wrong notes" thrown in - unexpected notes - at least to pop/rock people (Jazz players might go "meh").

FWIW, even though the DMaj8 and Em9 would be Dorian, long time ago it wasn't uncommon to put a V7 in modes just like we do in Minor/Aeolian.

So it's a sound we're familiar with - and that also "holds it together" in a way that sort of allows these other "wrong notes" to not cause any serious problems.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; I think the big take away here is that a series of chords isn't always functional. Trying to do functional analysis of this chord progression is going to be challenging because the <b><u>harmony</u></b> doesn't abide by conventional tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 

Right.

"How would I identify it?"

1. By writing the Notes down.
2. By writing the Chords down.

We don't "identify" chord progressions, except for a handful of clichéd patterns, and those are colloquial names.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The "B" note means it is G Major, not G Minor.

Are you saying the notes are in a single line, like played like a melody? Played one after the other?

Or all they all sounding at once, or overlapping.

This may not be a "chord" at all, but is simply a melody.

Without the context it's really impossible to tell.

If the <b><u>harmony</u></b> were a Cm chord during the whole time this is played as a melody, then the B and D notes would be non-chord tones. But they're not really an "embellishment" at that point, just melodic tones.

But if there were rhythmic things happening, it could move them more towards being decorative.

Really need to see the context, especially since the B natural doesn't imply G Minor as you think.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No. Yes. Maybe. Depends.

Ear Training is more a means to an end, and not an end in itself.

There are ways it could improve your solos, but you can certainly solo without knowing some of the specifics of what a lot of people "ear train".

And I think, for most of us, for practical use, it's more of a "acute ear" or "good ear" or an even better way to put it - "paying attention to what you're playing, and how it goes with everything else you're hearing".

Obviously, one aspect that we could call "ear training" is just simply being able to tell what's going on so you can tell if you're playing a wrong note or not.

The Key is A Major, and you're moving between an A Major and E Major chord.

You play an F. It sounds bad. Or at least "outside". Or bad.

So you have to have an ear that's good enough to recognize that that note is a wrong note.

So anyone who's not at that level yet would definitely benefit from just learning to listen, pay attention, and comprehend which notes sound good and which don't.


A by-product of this is more experiential, but if you play a bad note, you need to fix it - so ear-training can be beneficial in that if you know you hear not only a "wrong" note, but a note that's a half-step off, you can move it a half step to a "correct" note and fix it on the fly.

Now me, personally, it works more like "what the heck am I hearing, whoops, I'm on the wrong fret, oh, that's an F and I meant an E, let me move it". Which happens pretty much instantaneously (and if my mind lags, I just play the wrong note again, that much more aggressively, and continue to do so until such time as it seems it wasn't actually a mistake but intentional...).

So it's more of "ear-ring" it to hear it wrong, then "theory-ing" it to fix it.

Now, let's say I'm playing with another guitarist, or someone else is improvising. Sometimes I like to play a musical game with them, so they'll play the 3rd of the chord, so when it's my turn to solo, I do the same thing. Or I copy their riff - so being able to identify at least the starting (and ending) pitch, any "guidepost" pitches along the way, and the overall pitch contour is essential for "mocking" them on the fly.

Same thing might happen if I'm playing and maybe there are some horn stabs within the solo, I might also try to cop the same notes the horns do to "ride" on what they're playing as well.

It makes things sound a little more intentional, and even rehearsed.

But, if you haven't rehearsed it, and you're doing it on the fly, a good ear is essential.

Another use can happen - I was playing "I Want a New Drug" by Huey Lewis and the News with a band, and the horn section wasn't there that night. I knew the keyboard player didn't know the horn line, so I "improvised" it on the spot. Now I know the song from hearing it plenty of times, so I had the "musical memory" of how it goes. So I could "guess" (I'm not good enough to "know" the right notes) at the pitches and basic shape, and was able to - by the second time playing the line - have it pretty darn accurate. And my ear is decent enough that when I played it the first time, I could keep what was right and change what was wrong the 2nd time. I dare say my ear is decent enough that the corrections I made were probably 75% secure.

Far and away though, my ear has been more useful for me for learning existing songs - including solos.

So what I was talking about before - "mental memory" is important. This is easier with "singable" solos - the first I ever learned was from Journey's "Don't Stop Believin' " (when it was out!) and it was easy to learn because it's so "singable" - in fact, it's just basically the main melody of the chorus.

So I was able to mentally "record" that melody into my head, so when I was trying to figure it out I could check against my own mental recollection of the solo, rather than having to always check against the record.

Over the years (decades) I've done this so much that I have been put on the spot many times at gigs to play a song I don't know or haven't learned, and I can fake my way through becuase I've heard it enough in the past to be able to "predict" where things are going to go, and my ear is decent enough (and my theory skills excellent enough ;-) to be able to "play it on the spot" - and play reasonable facsimiles note for note (i.e.not just totally improvising) because I can "find the notes on the fly". They're not 100% correct, but heck, sometimes I'm as close this way as when I'm playing something I'm - ahem - supposed to know and make mistakes on!

But I'm going to be honest with you - I have never sat around with an ear-training app. Actual music - playing actual music has been my "ear-training app". I just find this far more practical - the actual use of notes, intervals, and chords in music I play - than the abstract "sing a Major 6th down" kind of exercises.

I mean, truthfully, I've luckily not yet had the interval police come by and harangue me because I couldn't identify or sing an interval at an instant and had to take a second to figure it out or, god forbid, play it on some instrument.

So I don't care about intervals really. I care what chord member a note is within a <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Or what scale degree it is. I can tell when passages are in parallel 3rds, or 6ths, or even 4ths, etc. and I can tell a power chord from a triad from a 7th chord from a 9th chord and so on - and on guitar I can even tell whether they're 3 note voicings, or full barre chords, or "cowboy" chords an so on. I'm good enough to tell what a chord progression is (like I - IV - vi - V) by hearing it, even if I don't know the key - but I can guess the key pretty accurately and if it it uses open chords, even more easily, and I can tell if the guitar is tuned down, in dropped D, and so on.

But all that comes from playing a lot of guitar and a lot of songs.

But I would have trouble telling you if a Major 6th or Minor 6th interval was played down. Sometimes I get 4ths and 5ths confused still. Because it's not all that important to me - because I can figure it out if I need to with an instrument, or some time - which I generally seem to have.

But I can absolutely play the 3rd of a C chord and jump down to the 3rd of an Em chord - that's a M6 down but I don't really care, because to me it's "3rd of the chord" to "3rd of the chord" which for my uses is usually a lot more practical (as I might be harmonizing a line, or providing counterpoint, etc.).

So in summation, yes ear-training can help improve your musicianship, and your soloing, but IMHO **practical** experience playing your instrument and actual music is far more useful than "abstract" exercises. They won't hurt - they're a tool and have their place, but they should not replace good 'ol playing - only supplement it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you're asking me, I would say, for me, yes.

I don't really think in scales - I think in Keys because most music I play (and actually most everyone else wants to play too) is Key-based (but there is scale-based music out there too).

So when I'm in the key of X, if I know if I recall that the next chord went "up", that my first bet is going to be to go up to a chord still in the key of X (unless I know it sounds "out of key").

I tend to think more in terms of direction and distance - ascend or descend, then by step, small leap, larger leap, and so on. As I said, my ear is "decent" so I use these broad strokes to "get in the ballpark" and then "fine tune" once I kind of get there.

But, by targeting notes of the Key (which we could call notes of the scale) or if I know the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, of the chord, I'm increasing my odds of getting a right or at least not-too-offensive note.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yeah, it's a melody. And which notes of the melody are chord tones depends on the underlying <b><u>harmony</u></b> as u/theredwoodcurtain points out. It sounds to me like the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is actually changing underneath.

I have some advice for you: I've seen a number of your posts and it seems like you're trying to learn some of the very basic things in music like "what is a melody" or "what is a <b><u>harmony</u></b>" and "what are embellishments" and so on.

The examples I've seen you post are not the best thing to learn this from. This style of music uses a lot of sounds that have modulation on them, or echoes and delays, or are very bell-like, and so on. The vocoder voice thing also makes things sound "phase-y" and "chorus-y". All of these things tend to make the musical pitches harder to distinguish - a lot of the pitch is what we call "indeterminate" - a cowbell is an instrument of indeterminate pitch - you can kind of hear a note in it (or a couple of notes) but it's hard to *determine* which is the main pitch. Other instruments can be very *determinate* in pitch. So a lot of these sounds, while still determinate, have a lot of "indeterminateness" in them, making them a little more difficult to identify specific notes in, or specific harmonies, and so on.

It may be helpful for you to try some songs (or other styles) where the chords and melody are more simply laid out for you (and it's always fun to discover more music along the way!) until you can get these basics down. Then while they may be obscured in some pieces, you'll be able to figure them out more easily with more listening experience under your belt.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>G = Root position G triad.

G/B = G triad with B in bass, or, 1st inversion.

G/D = G triad with D in the bass, or 2nd inversion.

G7 = G7 chord in root position - G in the bass.

G7/B = G7 chord in first inversion - B in the bass

etc.

However

G/F can be shown as G/F or G7/F - the first is just a shortcut. But it can mean simply a G triad over an F bass - and while that's a G7 in 3rd inversion, it could also be an F chord of some type.

So it could be a shortcut notation for FMaj13(#11) (or something like that, depending on the key and the context).

BUT - and here's the kicker:

C/F# is simply a C triad with an F# in the bass. It *could* be representing some type of F# sonority (F#7b5b9 or F#7Alt, etc.) but it could merely indicate a "walking bass".

For example, the following:

C - C/B - C/Bb - C/A - C/Ab - C/G

is usually intended to show you simply that the upper chord is static while the bass line walks down. I wouldn't necessarily call it C - CMaj7/B - C7/Bb - Am7 - AbMaj7#5 - C/G - that obscures the original intention.

Since you're familiar with classical composition, you maybe know figured bass - and it's just like that - it doesn't tell you exactly what notes to play specifically - it only tells you what "chord" to play. So with figured bass you get a bass line and numerals, in Jazz/pop you often get just a melody line and chord symbols. Same principle. You "realize" the <b><u>harmony</u></b> from the chord symbols (which can indicate the bass line as well as you see).

If you have the keyboard notation, great, but guitarists for example will read from the chord symbols, voicing the chords as they see fit, rather than trying to play the exact notation written on the staff (if they can even read as many don't).

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ha ha - right. Yeah it's a common tactic to play a single note (or octaves) in the left hand and a triad form in the right hand. And it's an easy trick to change the chords by just moving them up or down or the bass line up or down.

So for example, if you play C - G - F - G

but then move the bass line down to start on A but play the same intervals, you get Am7 - Em7 - Dm7 - Em7 - so it's an easy way to get a more complex <b><u>harmony</u></b> without all that much work (this is how "Evil Woman" by ELO is done).

So yeah, just sit back and enjoy the simplicity of this notation - it tells you up front what it is, you play it, and it can make a lot of cool chords pretty simply, and you get on to the business of making music and enjoying the sounds without trying to figure out its functional meaning or all this stuff.

Now, if your improvising to solo - that kind of stuff becomes more important, so it's good to know how to figure it out as well. But for playing, just go for it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So a couple of things here.

Most "classical" type melodies were often conceived with a functional harmonic progression in mind.

But when you think of a melody without that in mind, it is going to be difficult, if not impossible, to "force" it into a functional framework. It may work, but you might end up with odd-length phrases, and so on.

I think that's probably why a lot of people "melodize a <b><u>harmony</u></b>" rather than "harmonize a melody" today - because people don't really know how to conceive of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> at the same time as the melody - so really historically they're kind of conceived more or less together.

Now, some melodies can be treated contrapuntally and lend themselves better to that than a harmonic treatment - but even counterpoint is often times not functional in the same way harmonic progression is.

So I honestly would throw "functional" out of the window and forget about it, and just harmonize the melody with sounds you want.

Now, how you do that depends on a lot of factors. Some melodies will lend themselves to drone or pedal accompaniments, others to one chord per measure, or 2 chords per measure, and so on. Some times a melody wants a <b><u>harmony</u></b> change on beat 4 rather than beat 3 or the next 1. So it just depends.

For your example, I can see 2 chords per measure as follows:

Dm - F | Dm - F | Am - Dm |Dm - Gm | F  - Dm | Am - F | Dm - A | Dm

Now when you get to the Eb, your melody starts to change keys or modes. And that's going to affect the chords you can harmonize it with.

But going back to what I just did, that's not the ONLY solution by any stretch. And that last A - Dm move - the D note happens right before the bar, so you could change chords there. Likewise at the Am - F measure, you could easily stick a Gm in there to "walk down" on beats 1-2-3.

You could use 7th chords, so where I've put Dm-F you could easily put Dm7 for that whole first 2 or even 3 measures. And the Gm could be a Bb, or Gm7 and so on.

One thing about 7th or 9th chords is, there are more chord tones in the chord.

But you have to also understand that a melody like this might sound completely different if you accompany it with something like just quarter note D notes. Or broken octave D notes in quarters or 8ths - each will give a different feel which could be quite appropriate for what you want.

Another thing to note is, because your melody kind of outlines chords already - like your first measure screams out "I'm a Dm chord" - you don't necessarily need a full Dm chord in the accompaniment. You only need enough to seal the deal.

You could also accompany this with a "directional" bass line like (each for 2 beats) - D - C | Bb - A | F - G  | D and not need any more "filler" notes or "busy" stuff going on - because your melody is "active" enough - sometimes a "running" melody like this is better off accompanied simply because a too busy accompaniment can detract from and interfere with the melody.

I mean you can try for the "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" type thing where almost every single melody note is harmonize with a different chord, but that's only good if you want that feel.

But to go back to your last question which I touched upon at the beginning - you can't "force" a functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> to a melody that wasn't conceived with that in mind sometimes. Of, if you do, it sounds forced.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;I can't really figure out what's is going on from like a Roman Numeral chord number POV.

And why does this matter? How does it help you?

&gt;When I transpose the part up even like two semitones it doesn't sound like it works, it sounds like it only works in this very specific part on the keyboard, which is completely foreign to me.

That shouldn't matter. It may be that you're just so used to this one, anything else sound foreign, but out of context, as long as the relationship is the same any transposition won't change the effect.

&gt;Is it some sort of Bb13b9aug5 chord? so the V of i, if Ebm9 is our i?

There you go. See. You got it. So now you can call it a "V" of some sort.

See, "naming it" explained it didn't it?

Wait, no, it didn't it?

Right, that's my point. Simply "naming" a chord or "figuring out it's Roman numeral might not be all that informative.

What's "going on" is a common Funk move - and this happens on guitar a lot because it's easy for us to do, is a minor triad such as Bbm, typically voiced Db-F-Bb on guitar (one finger across the upper three strings) moves up chromatically to Bm. 

Now if you place Eb under the first (or Eb and Gb if you like) you get an Ebm9 (this is also commonly done as Eb9).

When you slide it up, you can really put any bass note under it, but putting the Bb under it gives you your odd chord.

Side note - actually on guitar, we can add the 4th string in as well, which is less common, but in this case it adds our Gb to the equation (you could also do Ab for other chord structures).

What this gives you is a GbMaj7 moving up to the G Maj7, with an Eb then Bb bass.

This "moving around a Maj7" idea is common in a lot of neo-soul neo-jazz, R&amp;B funk style music.

IMHO, a lot of pop music is like this - <b><u>harmony</u></b> is "incendental" and "resultant" of separate "streams" of music. One "stream" is the chordal stream - GbMaj7 - GMaj7 while the other "stream" is the bass stream of Eb - Bb.

The "resultant" <b><u>harmony</u></b> is Ebm9 and Bbgobbledygook.

So is it i and V? Sure.

Is it tonic and dominant? Sure.

But isn't more like "home" and "not home"?

Really, it's more like a chromatic decoration of the upper parts with an alternating bass. So in some sense it's all Ebm9.

To make this a little more clear, a similar common move guitarists do is take their minor triad, let's say Bm to make an E9 chord - and slide it up TWO semitones to C#m.

Now if we hear that over a B note, we might be inclined to call that B13 or some kind of B13 (or simply C#m/B) but if you think about it for a second, the C#m chord gives you the notes of an E6 or E13 (if the D is kept present).

So this "sliding up and back" between these two minor chords sounds like two "different" chords in the chordal stream, but from an E root standpoint (assuming this is on a funk kind of static bass vamp, like "Play that Funky Music") it's just another extension of the E7 chord.

Obviously, in your example, it sounds more like two "different" chords and in each situation it will depend on how the bass line moves - does it hang on the note of the 5 or brush quickly by it, etc. as well as the duration of the upper chord.

But that's the general principle of where this comes from - moving the upper chordal stream by X amount that is sort of "decorative" or "embellishing" the original <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and creating whatever coincidental <b><u>harmony</u></b> it creates with any other streams, like the bass line.

Listen to the beginning of Sheryl Crow's "All I Wanna Do" - while the bass notes follow the chords, you'll hear this Maj7 up a half step to another Maj7 kind of idea.

I guess I should mention that it's also an idea that's found in blues, where a player approaches their V chord from a half-step above, usually again with a 9th (but could be this minor triad portion). It happens all the time in turnarounds - there's a prominent one in "Tush" by ZZ Top, where the chords seem like Bbm going to Am.

But the bass notes are C#-D. So it kind of looks like a Bbm/Db moving to D9.

But it's a little easier to understand if you see the Bbm as part of an Eb9 chord - so it's really just a half-step approach to the D9 - the approach chord (the "V/V" if you like in this context) is just missing the Eb and G, and all we have is some other bass note.

So it's "about" this guitar stream *implying* one set of harmonies, and this bass line that's playing another stream that has a note that makes some chord, but it's not the "whole story" if you will.

If we put an A note in the bass of the approach chord, we're back to a similar idea as your original (so kind of like V/V - V in this case, where V/V is Vgobbledygook/V!)

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you take a C Major scale, and play it, over a chord progression that goes Am - Dm - Am - Dm, etc. It's not going to sound very "major". It's going to sound like you're playing in A Minor. Because you are.

Because the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is making our ears focus on Am rather than C Major. You are "emphasizing" the notes (through chords) of Am.

And if you play your "C Major scale" but emphasize A on the Am chord, and D on the Dm chord, it's going to probably sound more like Am than "someone playing a C Major scale over an Am progression that doesn't know what they're doing".

But the same principle applies for other modes.

If you emphasize the notes of D Dorian by playing a <b><u>harmony</u></b> like Dm - G back and forth, and emphasing the D and G notes, or notes of the Dm chord and G chord in your melodies, it's going to sound like you're in D Dorian. However, you're still "playing the same notes that come from the C Major scale".

So you are just "emphasizing" different notes to produce a different mode.

This is ONE way to play modally. I call it a "rotational" way of thinking in that we're taking a "Parent" scale - C Major, and "rotating" the set to start on some note other than C.

This is EXACTLY how most of us are taught Minor works - you take major, and start on scale degree 6 and you have minor. Well, if you take Major and start on scale degree 4, you get Lydian.

The trick is, the chords you're playing and the melody notes you're playing need to *reinforce* the mode by also playing things that emphasize the "Lydian-ness" or whatever - just like we do with minor.

________________________________

While that works, there is ANOTHER way of thinking of modes that is actually far more useful and comprehensible, and more like actual music is made.

And that is rather than seeing all modes as rotations of some parent scale (usually a Major scale) to see them as "like" Major and Minor scales (since usually we're familiar with them already) and use those in a "referential" way.

Major is our reference point for Major Modes:

Ionian  = Major

Lydian = Major with raised 4 (#4)

Mixolydian = Major with lowered 7 (b7)

Minor is the reference point for minor modes:

Aeolian = Minor

Dorian = Minor with #6

Phrygian  = Minor with b2

(Locrian = Minor with b2 and b5 - rarer and less need to know it).

So what you're going to do here is say:

To Make F Dorian, I start with F Minor, and raise the 6th note 1 half step.

F - G - Ab - Bb - C -Db - Eb - F = F minor

F - G - Ab - Bb - C - **D** - Eb - F = F Dorian.

If you want D Mixolydian, you take D Major (since Mixolydian is "like" a Major scale with a change) and lower the 7th:

D - E - F# - G -A - B- C# - D = D Major

D - E - F# - G - A - B - **C** - D = D Mix

This method is more intuitive for a lot of people because they usually have already learned that in order to make Harmonic Minor or Melodic Minor, they just take a regular Minor and change a note or two.

So this is the same philosophy.

You start with the mode it's closest to - major or minor, then make any necessary alterations.

And the reason this is more "musical" is because if you're playing D Phrygian, by doing it this way you're already thinking "D" as the center - "rootedness" in D if you like.

The first way above involves more "reverse engineering" to find your mode (and more steps to possibly make mistakes on).

I mean which is easier:

D Phyrgian - Phygian is a minor mode, so I start with D Minor, and lower the 2nd. Done.

Or

Let's see, Phrygian is the 3rd mode of a Major scale, so if I want D Phrygian I have to count back 3 to found out what major scale it's the 3rd of, so that's Bb, or wait, B, no definitely Bb, so I use the Bb key sig, or a Bb Major scale, but start on D and emphasize the D notes...

I mean it's a nightmare. Plus mentally your brain always orients itself to this "parent" scale and gets you thinking about the wrong thing - which equates to you saying "Hey I'm playing in C Major" when you're playing in Am *just because* their the notes of C Major, and since you're more familiar with C Major, your brain defaults to it...

________________

So you can do it both ways, and there may be contexts where one is more practical than the other, but on the whole, learning your modes as "referential" to Major and Minor is more practical than "rotations of a parent scale" (which is your "emphasizing certain notes").

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;It seems like any defense of the current system would have to rely on the importance of the diatonic scale above all others.

The "justification" for the current system is two fold - tradition, and a huge body of work that already uses this system.

No need to re-invent the wheel so to speak.

&gt;Of course the diatonic scale in 12-tet is important as an approximation of the harmonic series and just intonation. 

That's an unfortunately uber common misunderstanding. Rather than get into a debate about it, I'll say that it's more appropriate to conceive of 12-tet as having evolved "in spite of" the harmonic series. Because it has nothing to do with it. It has to do with wanting to play in all 12 keys and have each as in tune as the others.

&gt;From what I can tell, most <b><u>harmony</u></b> is based on chord relations arising from a diatonic scale, and most non-diatonic scales are primarily melodic. <b><u>Harmony</u></b> outside of the diatonic seems to me to either be based on minor or temporary exceptions, such as chromatic mediants, augmented chords in line cliches, or secondary dominants. Is this oversimplification, and should other scales be thought of as important bases for <b><u>harmony</u></b>?

You have essentially described "Tonality". Tonality is a style of music that was used about 300 years ago for a couple of hundred years. Unfortunately, for some reason, people seem to keep wanting to use it, and in typical people fashion, lack the ability to fully understand the original context and thus only take away the basics which they can understand, and regurgitate a watered-down style that overly simplistically focuses on these elements you describe.

But there is a huge body of music prior to the Tonal era that does not follow these principles, and there is an entire body of music after the tonal era that does not follow these principles, and most of the music of most of the world does not follow these principles, except those styles descended from, devolved from, inspired by, etc. Tonality.

&gt;The obvious counter-example is harmonic minor in order to have a dominant chord leading back to i. However, couldn't this be more easily viewed as a secondary dominant? Does the harmonic minor scale feel as "real" to our brains as the natural minor? How often is it used, well, harmonically, rather than just for having melodies not clash with the dominant?

To make a very exaggerated point, "there is no such thing as harmonic minor".

"The Harmonic Minor Scale" is a mnemonic. It's a made up device to help us remember and potentially to explain how scale degree 7 is treated in minor KEYS.

So to take this back a notch, Tonal music is ABOUT KEYS - NOT SCALES - KEYS.

And that's the gross misunderstanding people have about it.

No one wrote (i.e.in the CPP) in "Harmonic Minor". They wrote in "a Minor Key" and adjusted the 7th note for "harmonic" reasons, or the 6th and 7th note for "melodic" reasons.

That practice, actually originates in earlier, pre-Tonal music - in Modality.

But to put things simply:

If you want "Key Based" music, your harmonic and melodic material needs to come from the Key.

And "Key Based" music developed a sort of hierarchical concept, where there were "native" elements of the key, things "foreign" to the key, and then things with varying degrees of relatedness to the key. Furthermore, each element of the key could have multiple functions, thus its level in the hierarchy was variable. So what we end up with is a context-driven model.

But a simple thing to say is, if you're using a bunch of chords that aren't in the key, you're not in that key.

And furthermore, you might not be in any key.

One thing that we have done though - which is quite fascinating and part of your discussion here - is we've taken the principles of Tonality and applied them to non-tonal post-tonal music in such a way that what we often call "modality" now is actually a hyrbrid of Modal and Tonal elements - we use a Mode as our pitch resource, but apply tonal principles to it.

So from that standpoint, we can say (if we want to) that Modes *can* use "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" - depends on how pedantic you want to be about what functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> means of course.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;it seems like everything is focused on <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody.

I know. It's a shame really!

And not to be evasive, but the answer is in music my friend!

Listen to how these things are used in music, and just take the ideas and use them for your own. Worrying about the theory aspect of it just gets you bogged down in things that can become distractions.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No "natural major". It's just "major".

What you've written is only true of Jazz.

In Common Practice Period music, the only chord with Tonic function is the Tonic (imagine that!).

Yes, the minor mode works the same way. But there's no "natural minor mode". It's just Minor.

And in a Minor Key, i is the Tonic, iv is the pre-dominant, and so on. The only difference is that v is changed to V, and VII is changed to vii^o to give those two chords Dominant function.

For other modes, like Dorian, etc. the general understanding is that historical, they didn't have these functions because they pre-date functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

However, in modern times, we very often use modes *as if they were keys* and we **treat** the chords as if they had similar or analogous functions to Major and Minor keys.

Thus, while we consider the vii^o chord in Major to have a Dominant function, in Mixolydian the bVII could "act" like the Dominant or be a "substitute" for it. Same with the V. Ordinarily, in minor keys, the minor dominant "v" is NOT considered to have Dominant function (sometimes it's called the modal dominant) but in a modern mode like Mixolydian where the 5 chord would be minor (v) we can still "pretend" it has a Dominant function and use it similarly.

How far this can be extended to other scales is questionable but there's a lot of music out there that has one "home" chord and one "not home" chord, and by analogy we could say, if they're not Tonic and Dominant per se, they might at least be taking on those roles.

It may be harder to identify any intermediary chords like a Pre-dominant in those cases, but if you had 3 chords which seem to take on the roles of "home", "driving to not home" and "not home", you might have an argument for a pre-dominant chord.

But as you can see that could potentially become silly and even uninformative as to what's going on in the music - in other words, these labels were designed for functional music, most especially Tonal music of the Common Practice Period - and while they still somewhat apply to descended styles (like Jazz - see the "update" we've made with the Tonic?) trying to make everything fit that model can be an exercise in futility.

So these work great for Major and Minor, less so for the other Diatonic modes, and then less so as the music becomes less-functional.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>3 = Em(o7). 

7 = B^o7(o3) would probably be your best bet.

I think we can't really use something like E^o7(#5) because #5 is going to be confusing - does it mean to raise the 5th of the diminished triad, or to raise the 5th of an Em triad (because we usually see #5 on perfect 5th alterations).

In theory, we wouldn't really want to call them their inversions becuase that confuses where they're being derived.

What you've basically discovered is the naming conventions we use were designed for Major and Minor sclaes pretty much, and while some alterations work for some adjustments (mMaj7 for example) when we get to more extreme cases the nomenclature breaks down.

For the last part - you aren't meant to do anything. You can do whatever you want!

It's true that in most music, most people actually use just diatonic <b><u>harmony</u></b> and put a different scale above it - common with Pentatonic scales - if you find a purely Pentatonic melody (I think Someone to Watch Over Me at least in part, and Those Were the Days as well, and Amazing Grace) they're almost always harmonized with diatonic chords - not "Pentatonic chords" - which is why it always kind of drives me bananas when people say a piece is "Pentatonic" - no, only the melody is pentatonic.

Same with "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" - usually the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is not quartal, it's tertian - there are just quartal **voicings** above the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (or as part of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>) - but the derivation is clearly tertian and diatonic.

But you absolutely can use any note set for melodic and harmonic content. This is commonplace in 20th century to present concert/art music - "classical" music.

IOW, you pick a note set, such as Harmonic Major, and you derive all Melody and <b><u>Harmony</u></b> notes from it.

They just won't be "traditional" major and minor based melodies and harmonies in some cases, and in those cases we don't have "traditional names" for those chords.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So this is going to be long, so bear with me, but I'll try to give helpful advice.

Firstly, what you're feeling is common. I myself stuggle with a lot of similar issues. I think it might even be "natural".

Secondly, let's clear up something that might help:

On one hand you'll hear people say "there are no rules, it's art". That is true. However, almost all people who become interested in composing music do so becuase they've heard something that inspired them that they want to emulate. And it's likely they've heard LOTS of music. So you can't really go into writing music without any preconceived notions about what is "right" and "wrong".

So on the other hand, there are "rules" - stylistic guidelines, "right and wrong", etc. Writing blues without blue notes isn't going to sound very bluesy. It's just going to appear that the write is naive if they think what they've written is "blues".

So you can't use the "there are no rules" argument as a cop out.

You can use it when you're writing music that is truly independent of any existing styles, and even make up your own.

But that's not what most people want to do.

Furthermore, some people want to do that, but don't know enough about music to know that all they're doing is simply writing pastiche, clichés, and derivative music that is just bad imitations of music they've subconsciously remembered.

So a great example is Parallel 5ths. You'll constantly see people on forums like this going "I'm working on this piece and I have parallel 5ths is that OK".

Well the long answer is, no, it's not OK if you're trying to write music that is stylistically similar to Classical music. So the problem becomes, this person has heard a Classical Period String Quartet, wants to write a String Quartet, and doesn't know enough about music to know that music has evolved past that, and writing a Classical style String Quartet is not only anachronistic, but really more of an homage. Music is a funny art like this because most modern Poets aren't trying to write like Shakespeare. They write in "contemporary" styles. But music - people still want to write music from 300 years ago, using the rules from 300 years ago, and in some ways, that's kind of silly.

But it becomes even more silly if you start of a piece with Alberti Bass and a melody, and it's pretty clear you were influenced by Classical music, but then do things that are "wrong" - because here's what happens - your listen immediately categorizes your music based on what they hear (right or wrong) and form expectations based on that prejudice. If your piece does not meet those expectations, it's "bad".

So, if someone wants to write 300 year old music, fine, but do it well. Learn the stylistic guidelines and adhere to them.

If you want to write 100 year old music, or 1,000 year old music, or music that sounds like it came from the 1980s (like a lot of synth stuff now), fine. Learn the style and do it well.

If you want to do an homage, fine, but understand the style.

If you want to write music that "hearkens back" or "pays homage to" and those sorts of things, that's fine to, but you have too do it in a way where it sounds INTENTIONAL (which is tricky) otherwise it sounds "dated" or unintentionally comical, or just plain bad.

Now, all of this sounds like I'm saying even more that you have to "follow rules" but that's NOT my intent.

My point is that you need to LEARN the music you LIKE.

NOT the music you THINK you're SUPPOSED TO like becuase you read it online, or someone told you etc.

I see all these people on forums like this go "you should study Fux" when they ask for advice.

That's just plain ridiculous. Sure, OK, there might be some times when that's applicable, but what you need to study is THE MUSIC.

Fuck the theory. Fuck counterpoint. Fuck <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Fuck all that shit.

LEARN THE FUCKING MUSIC!

What do you want to sound like? Find some music that sounds like that and try to emulate it.

OK, sure, you're going to have to learn what chords to make, or what is stylistic appropriate, but you know what? You already know the basics. And you can learn the rest FROM THE MUSIC.

How many times do we see someone here go "hey, I'm going from an A to a Cm chord, is that OK? "what's the theory behind it" "where does it come from" etc.

Who the hell cares (well, obviously these people do, but I often wonder how many are producing music rather than getting mired in worrying about if it's "correct" or not like you are).

Who the hell cares.

If it sounds good it is good.

Dennis DeYoung didn't worry if the beginning to "Come Sail Away" was "classically correct". It's obviously intended to be "reminiscent" of classical music, but in a rock setting. No further explanation needed. But if you try to write a Piano Sonata like that, people are going to form a different opinion.

So, what is it you want to write? If you want to write a Symphony in true Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven style, I'm going to say #1 to take the steps they did, and #2 immerse yourself in that music - studying it, playing it, reading it, and trying to write it. But always keep in mind, none of those composers first piece was Symphony #1.

Or are you just trying to write songs that are "modern" songs? What composers or songwriters do you want to sound like?

There are different approaches but the number one thing you can do is learn to play music on an instrument. The DAW can be an instrument, but you don't get the same kind of feedback you do when playing something like Piano. And traditionally most composers have decent to excellent piano skills. That's not a requirement, but it doesn't hurt.

So don't feel bad - this is actually tough stuff - and it's a lot of soul searching. And it's not something that happens in a day - it's a LIFETIME for some people.

There are composers who started in a style and discovered it wasn't for them, and totally changed direction later in life. In fact, I think there are more that have been "misdirected" by more "theoretical" things until they realized how restrictive it could be, and became better composers when they just let that stuff go and wrote what they felt.

So I know it's tough, but it's something probably most of us go through. And it may be that those of us who are not successful probably haven't had that epiphany yet.

So, what do you want to write? Can you give some examples of things that inspire you that you'd like to emulate?

HTH - sorry not more concrete and more philosophical, but I think it's kind of important to get that stuff out of the way.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Honestly, I haven't listened to that much of it, so I really haven't given him a chance. The few things I have heard sounded - well, this is why I didn't want to go into the reasons because I know this will piss off some people - it sounds like he doesn't know how to compose.

The harmonies seemed "thin", like a beginner composer that didn't know how to write complete chords. I'm exaggerating of course but it really does sound to me (what I've heard mind you) like you took some 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> and removed 1 or 2 parts.

It's hard to explain but it just sounds "thin" and "incomplete" to me.

Robert Gauldin

Schoenberg

Walter Piston.

I nice trilogy to have is Piston's "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>", "Counterpoint", and "Orchestration".

I won't say they're the best, but really no book is - they all take different approaches.

You should really look for Robert Gauldin's "Practical Approach to 18th Century Counterpoint" (watch out, there's also a 16th century book with the same title, but unless you're interested in that style as well you probably will want the 18th century one). His <b><u>Harmony</u></b> text is also extremely good - maybe the best I've found, but it's not as well known.

The first three are kind of "standards" in most university classrooms (and as "texts" are ridiculously expensive). Gauldin's counterpoint books, and the Piston can be pretty cheaply had in paperback.

Schoenberg can be had cheap too. Honestly, I'd say he's more for the "completist" - it's very wordy (partly writing style of the time, partly translation, and partly just him) so it's a little more cumbersome to read IMHO. But again, they're not horribly expensive and nice to have for a different perspective.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's actually G Dorian.

The tell-tale note - the difference between G Minor and G Dorian is that G Minor has an Eb while G Dorian has an E natural.

But there don't seem to be any E notes in the first minute, so initially it does sound just like plain old G Minor (or that's what we'd assume, barring any further info).

One melodic bit keeps settling on an A note, which is not part of the Gm <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It also has some other notes like F, C, etc. that make it all kind of ambiguous. But since that G pedal sound (continuous sounding G drone notes) most everyone is going to feel like the "center" is G.

About 1 minute, a faster more prominent melody comes in and it clearly uses the note E natural. So at this point we have to say it's G Dorian.

G-A-Bb-C-D-E-F-G

I didn't listen much further than that so things could change again later (as they often do with music) but we can say it's G Dorian through the first minute or so.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>All I'm saying is that in jazz, as a generality, there's a lot more treatment of melodic tones as chord tones.

If you play an EbMaj7, and play Eb - F - G - A - Bb as a melody over it, are you playing the following chords:

EbMaj7 - EbMaj9 - EbMaj7 - EbMaj7#11 - EbMa7?

Or are you playing an EbMaj7 with a melody on top?

I agree that it's just the diatonic IV chord. But functionally speaking, it's just basically a IV - I don't know that we need to even talk about it being a IV7, but you can hopefully see how confusing it can be to someone when this chord that happens to have the 7th scale degree in the key over it for an 8th note now becomes something with a bit more involved name - EbMaj7#11, and then people start talking about Lydian, and so on and so forth.

It's an EbMaj7 with a melody note A above it. Someone thought it would be a good idea to base the chord name on including the A in there. So the A melodic note gets "subsumed" into the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

It's just a difference in the way non-chord tones and chord-tones are treated in different styles.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not necessarily the function, but just the amount of aural information available.

For example, I hear:

Am - Am - F - G - E

Am - Dm - Am - F - G - E (IIRC) at the beginning.

And I don't know if it's becuase you were talking about Major V, or my own indoctrination, but I want to hear that E chord as a Major V chord - so it's really pointing me to Am at the beginning.

But I don't hear a clear G or G# in it - I'm either inferring it from the G chord (or note) or casting my own prejudices on it (expecting the E).

What's interesting - and worth mentioning - is a lot of what people "feel" about songs has less to do with chord progressions (very little) and more to do with the arrangement and production (a LOT) - the kinds of instruments chosen, the way melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> interact, and so on. One interesting thing here is the melody is low enough where it sounds like a bass line, further adding to the ambiguity (see I would call that an arrangement technique, not theory though) - we're not really sure if it's a melody note or a bass note - for example, the Am chord has this E "under" it which makes it sound like it might at first be an Em chord, and so on.

Some other things happen melodically, like staying on the C melody note while the "bass" or "lower melody" moves from F to G - that would at that point imply a C chord, but initially - due to the lack of additional information, we would assume it to be a G chord.

I honestly don't have the time to tear it all apart but yeah it seems they're giving just enough information to make it sound like Am (i.e. not clear it it's B or Bb, and G and G#) and not until it's "revealed" to be Dm (by including the C# and the Bb) do things become clearer (at least I think I recall a Bb later in the song - if I'm wrong it could be B natural making it more D Dorian, but again I don't have the time right now to delve into it further - it may change later too...)

If you're not real familiar with Borrowed Chords aka Mode Mixture you can research that.

Borrowed chords create some Chromatic Mediants.

Real simply, the way it works is, you "borrow" chords from the PARALLEL mode (mode here just means major or minor).

So in D Major, you can "borrow" chords from Dm to use in D Major - common ones in pop are to use bIII, bVI, and bVII, but minor iv and minor v are also somewhat common.

So having an F, Gm, Am, Bb, or C chord in Dm is considered Mode Mixture (when those chords are clearly not used to make it in another mode altogether).

Borrowing is less common in Minor keys - as I discussed earlier, the V chord from major getting used in minor happens so commonly it's not considered a borrowing per se. So really, only when you have a Major I chord in a minor key does it seem like borrowing (and when that Major I chord is not a secondary dominant).

Some people see using something like bII in any key as a borrowing from Phrygian (becuase it can't "come from" either major or minor becuase neither of them have it) so "Mode Mixture" has been extended to "Modal Interchange" where you can borrow from ANY parallel mode, not just major and minor.

But just for a quick example, if you're in D Major and you borrow bIII you could have:

D - F - A

so D to F and F to A are both Chromatic Mediant relationships.

So usually one of the easiest ways to find a CM relationship is to use a borrowed chord, which also just comes from the Parallel key so it's kind of "more closely related" to your home key.

Some secondary dominants can do the same thing (so like F - to A - to Dm, but in the key of C) so you should look into secondary dominants if you're not familiar with them.

You also might look into the Neapolitan Sixth Chord, which is bII but in it's historical context.

N^6 - V is a chord progression that still sounds quite unusual today (it was fashionable for a certain time period, then fell into disuse).

But remember, "mood" and all that is not from chord progressions entirely - arrangement, texture, production, instrumentation, and so on have far more to do with people's "perception" of music.

The piece you linked to originally reminded me of "voodoo drums" or "tribal drums" and it didn't hurt that it was a marimba-like sound - so in my mind any "mysteriousness" came from the sounds themselves - making me thing of movies I've seen, rather than the chord progression specifically.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Which chord is "one"?

That will give you the numbers for the other ones.

There's no "analysis" here. You're just assigning roman numerals to the chords to make them "non-pitch specific" so they're easily transpose-able.

This is NOT how traditional Mode MIXTURE works, and I'm not sure it's even how Modal INTERCHANGE works.

In Mode Mixture, if the key was E, you could borrow the GMaj7 from the parallel minor, but not the DMaj7.

If you want to say you're borrowing them both from E Dorian, I suppose that's OK. That's what I would consider Modal Interchange (as I understand it).

But even then, it means the E would have to be heard as "home".

Is it?

This is instead called "Planing" if the voicing is kept from chord to chord (moving everything in parallel) or "constant structure <b><u>harmony</u></b>" when the same chord structure is used on each chord.

Since doing so rarely allows one to stay in any one primary key, one is typically no longer writing tonal music.

Thus using the numeral system designed to "analyze" tonal music doesn't mean anything - other than "numeralizing" the chords.

Which you've done.

If I ran into a progression like this, the last thing I would be thinking about is what key they're in, because no more than 2 chords at a time can be seen as being in a single key.

I would think of it as "3 Major 7th chords".

The only reason for worrying about what it is is usually to come up with melodic or improvisatory material, and for that I would start with the chord tones and then fill in with other notes that "sound best" in between those chord tones.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; I think some of the confusion is due to the fact that scientists use theories to describe the "laws" of the universe. Things that will always be true, and even must be true. Wheres music theory is just explaining / describing musical patterns that composers are using.

Yes, this is part of what I'm presenting as a confusing issue for many.

I guess the distinction is simply that in the arts, we generally use "theory" more broadly, whereas in the sciences its often used more specifically as you describe.

It would be interesting to see if "Theoria" was used earlier - but now that you've said it it probably was absolutely applied to music.

Praetorius used "Syntagma" for the title, which is "arrangement" or "constitution" (as in, things that make up something).

Though I though before, looking at titles isn't all that helpful because most of our "theory texts" are actually "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>" texts! And I think we all see Orchestration, Counterpoint, <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, etc. as all falling under "music theory".

Someone wrote a "science of the art of music" in the 1300s.

"Speculation" seems to be closely tied to the word "theory" and we have a treatise from  1300s there as well.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>1. A Key is a big topic actually. But to make it simple for now, you can say that a Key is a collection of 7 notes that are related to one primary tone, which we call the Tonic (or keynote, etc.) in specific ways, and related to each other in specific ways. It is those specific relationships to cause D Major to have 2 sharps, F and C, and E Major to have 4 sharps, F, C, G, and D. Keys developed within "Tonality" or Tonal Music - or we can say that Tonal Music is "Key-based" - it's all in keys. And there are two types, Major Keys and Minor Keys. Which brings us to your next question:
2. One of the things about Tonality, and about Keys was that yes, they do have the "same notes". So what we traditionally did in Minor Keys is change the 6th and 7th scale degrees depending on what function we wanted them to have, or the harmonies they formed to have. So traditionally, in music of the Common Practice Period (Baroque, Classical, and Romantic Periods, roughly 1650-1850) Minor Keys used two chords where the 7th note of the scale was changed! It was raised a half-step to make it a half-step away from the Tonic, which we call the Leading Tone. So Major Keys already have this LT, but in Minor Keys we alter scale degree 7 to create a LT. This was used on chords of a "Dominant" function, which are the chords built on scale degrees 5 and 7. So in the Key of C#m, you can expect to see a B# note used in the G# and B#^o chords instead of the "normal" (that goes with the key signature) B natural, which would make a G#m and B chord for those two spots. We don't always continue this tradition in modern music, but for music from the CPP, or music inspired by it today, this practice of using the Leading Tone in Minor Keys is what keeps the two from sounding the same (there are some other things, but this is a big thing).
3. A better way to think of it is, we use every other note or every other letter. We have a system of <b><u>harmony</u></b> (or again, this is what evolved into the CPP, and we still use it today for a lot of chords - but not all) called **Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b>** - and "Tertian" simply means "in thirds". Which is every other letter! So if you want to make a G Chord - ANY type of G chord, it's going to have a G-B-D in it. We call it a "Triad" when it has 3 notes like that. If we want to continue "Stacking" 3rds, we can, and we get "quartads", "pentads" and so on, but no one calls them that. Instead, they commonly call them by what number the added note would be above the note you're building on, which is called the "Root". So since it's every other letter, it's ever other number too, and counting the Root as 1, chords stack up 1-3-5-7-9-11-13. Plain triads are so common, we usually just say "chord" - a lot of times we don't even specifically say "triad" but that's what we mean. So a triad is Root-3-5 (which we say "3rd", and "5th"). But we don't mention the number again because they're so common. But if we keep stacking, you get a "seventh" chord - so G-B-D-F is a 7th chord because it's Root-3-5-7 (or 1-3-5-7). It has a Root, 3rd, 5th, and 7th - and we call it "7th" to differentiate from the triad version (which long ago used to be called a "chord of the 5th" but we dropped that long time ago). If we keep going, we get G-B-D-F-A - so that's a 9th chord, and G-B-D-F-A-C would be 11th, and G-B-D-F-A-C-E is a 13th chord. We don't have higher than a 13th chord because that uses all 7 letters of a scale. Also, there are a lot of different types which really you need to learn about in a separate post - too much to answer here! So no, the formula doesn't change. If you see "C" it's a triad and if you see "C7" it's a 7th chord (added one more third). Again though there are a lot of different types so that's another thread.
4. The names for intervals are based on the LETTERS, not number of semitones. C-D-E-F-G is C1-D2-E3-F4-G5 - see, 5 letters, a "5th".

One side note, the Circle of 5ths actually has little to do with Chords (actually, it has nothing to do with chords but a lot of people are under the mistaken impression it does and will argue forever about it). It has to do with KEYS - it's simply a convenient ordering for us so the Keys that are a 5th away add 1 sharp, or 1 flat, to the Key Signature. So the "fifth of G" in your example has nothing to do with the Circle of 5ths other than the conincidence that the Circle of 5ths is in 5ths! You don't use this to find the "3rd above G", nor do you use it to find the "7th above G", so you also don't use it to find the "5th above G". But you can use the Key Signature of G Minor to help find the notes of a G Major Triad, or a G Major 7 chord, because those notes of that chord will also be the 1-3-5-7 of the G Major scale. Likewise, you can use the key signature of Em to find an Em triad's notes or an E Minor 7  chord's notes as they'll also be the same as the Key Signature. But you don't use the C position on the Co5 to find a note in an Ab chord for example.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Wow, I hate to tell everyone, but the harmonies in Barbershop songs would be more familiar to Beethoven than they are to most people who've grown up listening to modern popular music.

And the ideas of "ringing" chords go back to vocal practices in the Renaisssance, which Bach would have been more familiar with.

Likewise, a largely homorhythmic setting? Mostly unobscured chords and text? That's what the church demanded Palestrina do.

IOW, Barbeshop music has far more in common with "classical" music than it does with modern popular music.

The commonly used common tone diminished 7th chords are commonplace in Tchaikovsky.

IOW, Barbershop singing is not THAT different from CPP music, and is actually indebted to "Salon Music" in many ways. Granted, Schubert would probably be closer than Bach, and even Bach's sons told him "dad, your music is old-fashioned", and Bach certainly didn't write Augmented 6th chords and highly chromatic voice-leading chords in quite the same way Mozart had begun to and Beethoven did - but Barbershop also didn't originate in a vacuum - composers were grabbing music of 50 years before - 1850 - Stephen Foster songs set to Romantic Period <b><u>harmony</u></b> pretty much.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>GaP was published in either 1722 or 1725 (I can never remember which, because Ramaeu's Treatise on <b><u>Harmony</u></b> was published the other year of the two).

Bach died in 1750 - he could have very well owned a first edition.

I would guess that Fux would have known the music of his contemporaries, and it's clear he knew the music of the previous "masters". But GaP focuses on the "Palestrinian" style, so it's clear he studied those works (or at least, distilled his rules from them). It's not so clear whether he considered the music of his contemporaries as important for distilling those rules.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>u/tjbassoon - I see a poster above was talking about Parallel 5ths being common.

Is that your experience? I'm no expert by any stretch, and there's probably a worthy distinction to be made between "original" Barbershop music at the turn of the century, the "revival" during the 40s, and then modern "rule-based competition singing".

Looking at the rules, I would have to sing one fewer 7th chord that required and just say "F U" on some other <b><u>harmony</u></b> that wasn't "allowed". (that's partly why I said it has become a parody of itself).

But did you notice many parallel 5ths in the competition literature, or was it more "traditional" voice-leading?

Curiously.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Paperback - Walter Piston (<b><u>Harmony</u></b>), Arnold Schoenberg (<b><u>Harmony</u></b> or similar title). These can usually be found much cheaper than "academic texts" which are ridiculously priced.

There's nothing wrong with older, used editions though, other than condition maybe.

It's not like someone's discovered a new chord and everyone had to go update their texts to reflect that. Essentially, this all the same old information from the 1950s or so just presented in different ways. Newer texts have all kinds of sidebars and bells and whistles to keep the younger generation's attention...IOW, they update the text a bit, maybe add new examples, or change examples, fix typos, sometimes re-organize the structure, and things like that, but otherwise many times a new edition isn't a significant change.

IMHO it's a good idea to read many of them, not taking one as the gospel. There's good information in all of them.

That said, I liked the Clendenning/Marvin and found it very "readable".

We used Kostka/Payne which I prefer over the Aldwell/Schacter but both are fine.

But start out with some of the cheaper paperbacks (I think I found both Piston's and Schoenberg's in a Barnes and Noble and they were like 14 or 18 bucks) if you're just wanting to encounter information and not looking for any kind of specific presentation.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Today, most musicians use modes as if they were a key, so the difference now is harder to define than in the past.

Historically, we can think of it this way:

A Key is a set of notes that have a functional hierarchy, where notes of the Key and the Chords created from them have functions associated with them, with varying levels of importance. One part of that importance is to functionally progress towards the Tonic goal. Another part which is an extension of that is to appear functionally in a way that reinforces, establishes, and confirms the Key Center.

A Mode - still speaking historically - doesn't have the same kind of "teleological" (goal-oriented) impetus. Instead, it's a little more like a "Palette of Colors" that produce a certain mood, with only some notes (Dominant and Final usually at some point) being "more important".

More simply (and definitely an oversimplification) a mode represents a collection of notes you use for pitch material - melodies and harmonies. A Key could be seen as a special type of mode where you do the same thing, but, all of the melodies and harmonies point to and establish the Tonic note/<b><u>harmony</u></b>.

But again, today, they are treated more similarly. So we use modes "as if they were a key", imparting some of those hierarchical elements onto a mode in such a way that it works more similarly to a traditional key.

Additionally, "mode" is used to refer to a couple of other things, but one is the "rotation" of a set of notes. I don't think that's what you're asking here but some others have already dived into that so I won't.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Firstly, this is the Trio section, and it "changes mode" from the first part being in C#m to Db Major - that looks odd, but really C# is the same note as Db (enharmonic) so it just changed from C#m to C# Major, but Db Major's a whole lot easier to read!

The only chromaticism right at the top is the first chord moving from a Major chord to an Augmented chord which is nothing horribly unusual.

The next little section (bass comes in and bass note drops a bit then comes back up) produces what's called a "secondary dominant" chord which could represent one of two things - either it's going to change key, or it's just going to emphasize a chord other than the Db Tonic chord of this section (we never know until after we hear what happens). This chord introduces some chromaticism that points our ears towards the key of Fm or F Major possibly. It does settle on Fm - this is the "3" chord (iii) in the key.

The next section though, where it goes to the high melody, is just Db again.

Now it gets a little crazier, because we get a similar idea to the secondary dominant above, but this time it's a half step lower, pointing not to Fm, but to Em (or E Major).

So here's the difference - Fm, the first one that the secondary dominant was applied to, is in the key of Db. But the Em or E  chord it might be going to, is not in the key of D.

And remember that section where I said it went up a bit than back. Well, this time he sort of goes up and down around the note that he previously went up from and back to, though all in a key a half step lower - it's like he's inserted some extra "wandering around this note" music this 2nd time around.

But an interesing thing happens this time - instead of going up a little bit, he goes up just a tad more, and that makes what we would have assumed to be Em based on the previous move E Major instead. It's also interesting becuase E Major is related to the original key of C#m - and in fact this chord he goes up to this time is basically a C#m chord!

He finally gets to the E, but it's not "final" sounding because it's inverted (meaning a note other than E is the lowest sounding note) and then he very sneakily raises that note a half step, making it a dominant chord to Db again.

Now this is kind of important - The first secondary dominant chord was a C7. If you raise it's bass note a half step, you get a Db diminished 7, which through some sorcery I won't go into here since you say you don't know that much, is the same chord as an Eo7 - and both C7 and Eo7 are Dominant chords to F (or Fm).

So this little half step move makes the chord sound different, but doesn't really change where it goes necessarily. But, the diminished chord is symmetrical (part of the sorcery) so it can actually resolve to other places and when it does, we go, "oh, ok".

So bear with me a second here - he takes his B7 which would go to E or Em, then inserts some other stuff, and gets to an E, with a B in the bass, but then raises that B a half step, turning it into a Co7 (which results from those moving notes you've been hearing in the viola throughout) which is a Dominant to Db - our original key for this section! Then he plays this little chromatic trick again to add a few more chords until finally arriving at the final Db chord.

Now, part of what you're hearing is probably this "slipping" of the chromatic half steps (which is kind of set up by that first Tonic to Augmented Tonic move) and the "moving up and back" or "up and down around" a particular note that acts as an anchor to the progression, and that he keys he's "slipping to" and the secondary chords being used are all also only half steps apart and so on - it makes for a fairly restrained and compact harmonic background, where the soaring melody kind of sets it apart over.

But another part is that the violas are doing a microscopic version of this "around a central note" up and down and back kind of motion - and part of why this "comes together" is that those moving notes catch the different chords - sometimes the first note is part of the chord, but sometimes the up and down notes are part of the chord - in fact sometimes the other parts are just playing one note, like F, just in multiple octaves - so it's only the violas producing the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

So he was kind of sneaky because by using the violas like this, he sort of guaranteed himself to get chords that work with the bass notes like they do, but what he could also do is keep the basic pattern the same (up and down wise) but alter the notes slightly (so it doesn't sound like a big move) but produce a totally different <b><u>harmony</u></b> that lets the bass notes also subtly change, yet provide a new sound.

It's not super complex, but it's highly inventive - it's an inherent thing built into the system that he's creatively exploiting.

So you're right - you're hearing key changes and suggestions of other keys, and chromaticism, but it "comes together" because of the way he used those elements to keep a relatively confined, subtly restrained harmonic element that kind of slips and slides up and down, which provides enough variety that it never sounds like it strays too far, but keeps your interest.

Very cool passage, thanks for sharing it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You just answered your own question too :-)

If a song or passage has "no defined tonal center", then it's not in a Key!

Think of it this way - if I played G-C-F-B-E-A-D as a quartal chord, with nothing else to define the tonal center - just because all of the notes of C Major are present doesn't make it in the key of C. In fact, G Mixolydian would be a better choice only because the chord is "rooted" on G (assuming that we assume stacks of 4ths have roots, which they really don't, but we may equate this with a G13 in a quartal **voicing**).

IOW, just because all the notes of a key are present and used exclusively, doesn't make the music in any particular Key. What makes it in a key is an emphasis of one note/<b><u>harmony</u></b> as the "home" chord.

So "no defined center" is basically "no home chord".



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Depends on how far you want to take this.

Any single note, in tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>, can be the root, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, or 13th of a chord.

C, Am, and F all have a C in them, as the root, 3rd, and 5th.

If we continue on, we have Dm7, "Bo9", G11, and Em11(b9 b13).

If you change C to C#, it affects any chord it's in.

So yes, it will make those chords a different quality. Am would become A Major for example.

If you altered only F#, you'd get the same qualities as would appear in any other Major Key because all you've essentially done is change C Major to G Major (so the F chord in C becomes what the F chord in G would be, F#o)

And if you change the accidentals in the order of flats or sharps, this will always be true.

Changing only 1 or some "non-5th" ones will produce either modes, or different scales.

So a scale like C - Db - E - F - Gb - A - B is going to produce whatever chords those notes create - Co, Db+, ? (Esus2), F, etc.

If you mix flats and sharps, you'll get other results.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think the OP is talking about something slightly different than what the other posters thus far took into account.

u/solitarybikegallery,

You can "harmonize a melody" a couple different ways as we use the term. One ways is to build a <b><u>harmony</u></b> under the chord for that note. So for example, in your piece, you might "harmonize" your D note with a G chord.

But it can also mean "add notes above" which is the way I think you mean it.

In Jazz, often "the harmonized scale" means taking your scale tone as a root and then adding a 7th chord (typically) above it.

So your D would be "harmonized" in that way with a D7 chord typically.

But yes, it's also used generically (usually in pop) to mean adding a 3rd or 6th above the line (and sometimes other intervals, like 4ths, 5ths, etc.

So your D note would take either an F#, or B typically.

But you could, "in jazz style" add either triads or 7ths, or quartal voicings, and so on.

But u/jmbarlow 's first suggestion was actually my initial reaction to your post - you don't! If you "harmonize" in with a chord under it, it's not really a passing tone anymore (though there can be exceptions to this).

But not every melodic tone has to have a chord go with it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Rhythm is probably the single most under-represented aspect of basic musical skills. People focus way too much on getting the right note, to the detriment of playing it at the right time, or the right duration!

I've always felt that all musicians should be required to have an extremely thorough understanding of rhythm before they're even allowed to pick up an instrument that produces different pitches.

Instead we kind of do it bass-ackwards!

What you should study is MUSIC - all aspects of music. But yeah, typical "music theory" approach is definitely biased toward pitch and <b><u>harmony</u></b>. So if you start there it's not the end of the world. Just make sure you don't neglect the other stuff.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Surely not all elements of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> are lost when you move to locrian? 

I'm afraid they are. Consider this: In tonal music of the Common Practice Period, there were two "modes" - Major and Minor. But Minor is rarely (never would even be safe to say) used without an *alteration* - composers essentially had to pull in the elements of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> used in *Major* keys to use in minor to "de-modalize" it and further "tonalize" it. Of course I'm talking about the V anve vii^o chords.

A lot of people have not studied pre-Tonal Modality extensively (or even spuriously) but this process was actually happening well before the Tonal era and in fact is what caused the shift towards tonality. Dorian mode used a C#^o for the cadence, and Mixolydian used a F#^o - IOW, if the mode didn't already have a half step approach to the Final, they put one in!

So in a sense, a plain, unaltered mode is "un-tonal" to begin with! And thus it's "non-functional" in the way we think of it.

So all of them have 7 triads in the scale, but we already mess with 2 of them in Aeolian to make it Minor. Which means, 7 triads only points to one Tonality - Ionian. The rest have to be "re-directed".

I suppose the question then becomes, how many alterations can we make before "modal-ness" is replaced by "tonal-ness".

In the case of Minor, there's still some remnants of Dorian, but not much.

All of the pieces Bach "tonalized" that were modal melodies, just essentially sound like the end wrong, not that they're necessarily modal - even Beethoven's "In the Lydian Mode" movement from a string quartet pretty much just sounds like I - V/V - V instead of I "II" V - and that's because it's "so tonalized" it's lost much of its sense of modality.

And back to that other point - because we'll inevitably compare Locrian to other modes, the b2 and b5 become THE primary elements that separate it from the rest of the modes. So if you take away those notes, or try to used chords that alter those, you're "losing the Locrian" feel.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are some tricky things in here, because the bass notes change from the root of the chord to the 5th of the chord, which some people will give you crazy answers for, but the framework of the song is:

F - F (or F6) - F - C7

C7 - F - G7 - C

F - F - D7 - G

Bb7 - | F-Dm | G - | F7 - C/G - Ab7 - F7/A ||

Chorus:

Bb - F7 - F7 - Bb 

Bb (or Gm7 ) - F/C - C7 - |same pattern that leads into the chorus|

Bb - F7 - F7 -  D7

| Cm/E (or Eb6) - C#o7 | Bb - F - Bb

Each chord is once per measure, except where I put | x - y | which is two or more chords per measure - everything between the uprights.

This piece uses a "alternating bass" type of pattern, and sometimes the lowest note changes within a measure - for example, in the Chorus, the first two measures could be |Bb - Bb/D | F/C - F |

and so on throughout the song.

I only included an alternate bass note (chord/bass note) where I felt is was important, but you could just play whatever's before the slash (C/G could just be C for example). IOW, I didn't write all those out.

Likewise, you could go crazy naming all the chords specifically. Like the first measure would be notated by some people in some styles as:

Fadd9 - F - Am/C - Dm7/C - Am/C - Am/C (or C6).

That's a little crazy and musically, not actually what's happening.

It's a <b><u>harmony</u></b> supplied by the inner parts, reinforced by the bass notes, though they do alternate to different chord tones, and then a melody on top.

If you play the chords I gave you, they'll work and since I don't know how soon you need to take care of this it may have to be good enough.

Others may come along with refined versions, but still others might come along with even more confusing versions, so if time is an issue, pick one you can do that sounds right and go with it. The tribute is in you guys doing it for her in her memory - doesn't have to be a Joe Pass chord-melody arrangement I don't think...

Sorry for your loss.

Peace.

 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I understand the reason for your question, but the first thing you need to do is step back and remember that music is not about chord progressions. It's about MANY factors of which chord progression is one (and a minor one at that).

There are a huge number of factors that can make music sound more sophisticated. Rhythm is probably the absolute most under-utilized aspect - and will get you the most mileage. In fact, a decoration is really a *rhythmic* accentuation to a note/chord - it's less about the pitch change and more about the rhythmic element. Suspensions, Appoggiatura, etc. are about rhythmic displacement. "Filling in between chords" is a rhythmic approach as much as it is a pitch one.

IOW, there's a big difference between adding a 9th to a chord, and having a 9-8 suspension into a chord. Both may make the <b><u>harmony</u></b> "more complex" but they achieve it in different domains (pitch domain versus time and pitch domain).

Add DYNAMICS in there, and you've got MUSIC, not just a chord progression...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't understand what it is you're trying to do here?

A "slash chord" is one that simply has a bass NOTE that is different from the Root of the chord and that's all. 

"C" means a C Major chord, with a C note assumed as the lowest sounding note ("the bass").

C/E means a C Major chord with an E in the bass.

You can have Triads with bass notes that are not chord tones:

C/F# means a C chord with an F# in the bass.

In some cases, the bass note could prooduce another nameable chord, such as:

C/Ab - which of course means a C chord with an Ab in the bass. However this chord is "probably" an AbMaj7#5 instead.

Sometimes, it's just a shortcut way of writing chords with higher extensions, or to make sure those extensions are played, such as C/D, which is really a D11 of some time, but it makes the player include the 7th, 9th, and 11th in their voicing. Likewise it can be used to show bass movement under a static chord, like:

Cm - Cm/B - Cm/Bb - Cm/A - Cm/Ab etc. Most of those chords could be named something else but in this context the chords are shown as slash chords so it's clear the upper <b><u>harmony</u></b> is static while the bass note moves chromatically. calling them Am7b5 and AbMaj7 might not make that as clear.

Likewise, a static bass with moving chords can be shown similarly:

A - C/A - D/A - F/A  etc. No real need to call the 2nd chord Am7 as it doesn't show the larger movement.

With 7th chords, you can do the following if the 7th is in the bass:

C/Bb means a C chord with a Bb in the bass, making it a C7 chord.

But you may also see C7/Bb.

For some chords this distinction may be important (including some of the examples above) but in other cases it's simply just a matter of choice on the arranger's part.

What you seem to be talking about instead are more properly named "Polychords" and are typically written one over the other, more like:

C
____

Bb

That's different from C/Bb. This notation is literally a C Triad over a Bb Triad. This means Bb6/9add#11 (or Bbadd9,add#11,add13, or similar names) whereas C/Bb *might* mean than, but more specifically means a C chord with a Bb bass note.

So the real difference is that in an X/Y configuration, Y is a single note.

In the 

X

___

Y

configuration, Y is an actual CHORD.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>One issue is the transcriptionist should have probably used flats in those passages rather than sharp.

Additionally, it's not C, it's in Am.

Also, you can't really just take the guitar part alone. You need to look at what any other instruments are doing.

mm. 9 and 10 are essentially an Fm7 chord but, he's playing with Quintal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> here, or at least Quintal voicings of chords (probably something to do with the name of the piece). So when he moves to say, the C/G dyad on the last beat, is that a C chord, or part of an Fm9, etc.

Note that:


F - Ab - C - Eb - G are stacked 5ths - F-C-G- and Ab-Eb.

mm. 11 and 12 are more fully quintal, with :

Db - Ab - Eb - Bb then to G-C-F.

Also notice that from the previous measure:

F-C-G-(D)-Ab-Eb the Db is what's missing and that's the first "root" note of the next pattern, which also takes us to Bb, then "back down" to G-C-F:

F-C-G-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb which gives you Fm

So he seems to be playing with these 5ths and then a 3rd on the outside of them, like A-C-G, or Eb-Ab-F and the measures end with E-A-F and Ab-G-C respectively - so these 5ths within m7 and Maj7 chords:

A-C-E-G, and F-A-C-E, and F-A-C-E-G as sort of the first note collection, then F-Ab-C-Eb-G as the second one. There are all kinds of stacked 5ths in there and m7 and M7 chords that hes just emphasizing out of the note set. The next group just extends even further on the idea but is still essentially "F minor-ish". So he's moved keys a chromatic mediant from Am to Fm. It's obviously a little more involved than that but that's basically what the "centers for the notes sets" are doing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Most likely because while any note in any register can be a pedal, we tend to think of them as lower notes. But yes, open string "drones" on guitar especially can be seen as "pedal" notes and may or may not be included in the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - not included as "non-chord tones".

The common B-F#-G-F# or D-F#-G-F# type patterns kind of use the G as an upper neighbor to the F# and could be considered a non-chord tone, but since we usually overlap the sustain for effect, and often they sound throughout, we sort of tend to conceive of them more as a chord tone than not.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Honestly, you don't really need to "study theory" to write music. The vast majority of people out there writing music don't.

Now, in some ways, just learning the musical elements of a given style by playing them is "learning theory" from that perspective - but see, you can pick that up "by ear".

So I would encourage you to study theory, but it's not a prerequisite to writing music in the way I think you're conceiving of it (please excuse my assumption).

Learn to play music by people you love listening to - and even those you don't - the more music you learn to play, and ultimately study, analyze, take apart, and put back together, the more you'll "intuit" theory (and it works better if you put it into practice!). The "study" part more or less just puts terms to the concepts you're already using.

As has been said many times, theory is descriptive, not prescriptive.

But it certainly won't hurt! - Check out the links in the sidebar. Furthermore, once you're past the "basics" it becomes more style dependent - so if you're into jazz, you might not care to read a classical <b><u>harmony</u></b> text.

There are a couple of those "dummies" type books out there which while maybe re-hash for you, still might have things you missed or forgot or hadn't thought about, etc. so those might be good choices as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I see your point. Certainly, I can tell of things are scalar, or triadic, or if there's any pattern such as up two steps down a leap.

And sometimes, in a pattern like that, all I really need is the starting pitch and I do think "linearly" to figure out the rest.

And it's also not always scale degree - it's often "chord member" - so for example, I know a chord may have changed from I to IV and my brain says "that's the 3rd of the CHORD" rather than "that's scale degree 6".

But it's also kind of like all this stuff happens simultaneously - kind of like those things wehre oyu loko at tetlesr adn oyu anc sitll kame out hte wrods.

I see a "t" an "h" and an "e" and I kind of know that that's a word, and what it means, and as I'm reading, what it references in the sentence.

So it's really kind of hard to analyze any one thing that's going on when transcribing because really, a number of things are going on.

But, I'm more likely to go "that's the 7th" of the key, or of a chord, before I think, "OK, the melody just went up a Major 3rd".

That's actually irrelevant to me. But, once I know what the two notes are, I'll know it's a Major 3rd. BUt it's more important for me how they relate NOT to each other, but to the tonal center or any <b><u>harmony</u></b> at hand.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>That's an E, and a G#.

It's just an interval, or a "Dyad", but, since we deal with chords like Major and Minor chords that contain these 2 notes commonly out of a set of 3, and they are so commonly used to IMPLY the whole chord, we'd say that this is an "E" (E Major) <b><u>harmony</u></b> (or chord).

If you check, the note you're playing when you play a big open E Minor chord in 1st position will include the open 3rd string, which is G.

But the E MAJOR form there has 1st finger (usually) on the 1st fret of the 3rd string, making that note G#.

If you play the low open E, and the 3rd string G# together, it's the same two notes as low open E and the 11th fret of the A string.

So you can kind of see these two notes as a "subset" of the full E Major chord.

The song is sort of built around E MINOR, but Iommi has some fun with it and slips in some E MAJOR (or E Mixolydian) ideas from time to time in a super tasty way!

So normally, we say it takes 3 notes to form a chord, but 2 of those three can imply  the full 3 notes based on context or common use, etc.

For example, if you play Iron Man, you should have "Power Chords" that are the root and 5th of a chord, like E and B, or G and D, or A and E, etc. Only 2 notes, but we call them "chords" because they're so commonly used that way (used to imply <b><u>harmony</u></b>). We can't officially tell if a power chord is Major or Minor, because it lacks the 3rd of the chord, which is important for that, but we can also infer from other chords what it might be if it were present.

Usually we call a Power Chord, "E5" or "G5" etc - which implies the Root, and 5th, with no 3rd.

Triads (3 note chords) have a Root, a 3rd, and a 5th. So when you just see "E" (for E Major) or "Em" (or E Minor written out, etc.) you'll have the same Root and 5th as the E5 Power Chord, plus either the major or minor 3rd, which are only 1 fret apart - as you should be able to tell if you play the big open Em and E (major) chord forms, or move that 11th fret note down to 10 (which makes the same note as the 3rd string open).

Here, we only have the root and the 3rd, and NO 5th. But because the root and 3rd are enough to imply the chord - and we get the bonus of knowing if it's the minor 3rd G, or the major 3rd G#, we can call it "Em" or "E" (major is assumed without the "m") even though it's only 2 notes - or, at least we can here because the song has kind of already started on E (and it's the lower note), and later music indicates E is pretty much the center for the song.

So some people might be persnickety and say "well it's not really a chord, it's just a Dyad or interval" and that's true, but in a context like this, it's also safe to say it's implying an E Major <b><u>harmony</u></b> at that point. 

So yes, it is "missing" the 5th, but the context implies it well enough that we can call it an "E Major <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" if not specifically an "E Major Chord".

Check out the riff in "Unforgiven" by Metallica - the "heavy" part that starts about 1 minute in after the softer section. They do a very similar kind of thing with notes on the D string around the 12th and 10th frets, along with the A string open, then that idea moves down to 10 on the A and low E open. Then the whole idea moves up to the D and G, and then A and D strings. 

Writing music on a similar principle (and I'm sure they learned a little BS in their youth!)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There is no notation for it really.

If someone were to put a chord symbol over it, they'd probably put just "E" for E major.

A lot of times in passages like this though they may put. "N.C." for "no chord".

Chord symbols are not meant to be specific, so we don't (or shouldn't though people try...) use them to notate specific voicing, only the implied <b><u>harmony</u></b>. E5 is a special case, and we don't really have things like E3 or E4 (and they actually mean other things in other contexts).

You'd notate it in Tab, or on the Staff and just use an "E" to show what it implied if you want.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>A melody moving through chord changes does not make a piece Tonal.

I would agree that it's probably more important to play than to worry about a roman numeral analysis, and that many would want to analyze it to understand which scale or scales go with each chord from that perspective - 

a perspective alone makes it "not tonal".

Though tonal music may contain non-functional passages, a piece that largely lacks functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> can't, by definition, be "tonal" - and I think that's the division here - I'm using "tonal" in the more strict sense of the word that does include all of the CPP trappings and functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

A lot of people say if it has notes, and chords, it must be Tonal. That's the opposite extreme but realistically, if you can't do an accurate Roman Numeral analysis, or one that doesn't make any sense, then the piece is simply not Tonal - which refers to a *style* and is instead something else. Post-Tonal, Quasi-Tonal, something new altogether.

This is true of pre-Tonal music - we don't analyze Modality (pre-CPP modality) with the same tools, concepts, and terminology as we do Tonal music. Maybe, just maybe, any post-CPP music that diverges enough from Tonal music also needs new terms and concepts - in fact, we already do - "back door progression" "tritone substitute" "chord-scale" and so on. These are new concepts, or at least ideas that are not conceptualized of in the same way by composers (first) and musicians and analysts. So we're already starting to develop terminology that represents concepts prevalent in the music.

So maybe, what some people are looking for (in their search for universality apparently) is more specific terminology for conceptual practices like half-step changes, that are non-functional, but as you said, super common - that's how analysis grew for other styles - they looked at what was super common, and gave a name to it.

Sometimes they co-opted older terms (in the wrong way) and that happens too, but it would be more informative from an analytical standpoint to help distinguish those elements that make the music not-Tonal, or not-Modal, or not-Serial, or whatever rather than trying to make a square peg fit in a round hole.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, the two keys differ by only one note.

C# D# E F# G# A B (C#)

C# D# E F# G# A# B - this 2nd on is G#m just starting on C# so you can compare them.

So the only difference is, G#m has an A#, while C#m has an A.

As long as you don't hit an A and A# at the same time, it's probably going to sound "OK". If you avoid either one, or don't play either, it won't matter.

But this is an excellent example of why you need to learn the Circle of Fifths and how it works.

But simply put, because these two notes - C# and G#, are a perfect 5th away, and that's how Keys are related on the Circle (of 5ths!) which shows us that any two adjacent keys (a 5th apart) share 6 out of 7 notes.

Also - this is not a slam - but be aware that sometimes people think something like this sounds good, but it actually doesn't :-)

But assuming you do get something good sounding (which is highly possible) by doing this, it won't always guarantee good results.

Furthermore another reason it can "sound ok" is because it's not uncommon in some styles - rock, punk, metal, etc. for guitarists to play "Power Chords" and when harmonizing, harmonize lines in 5ths rather than say 3rds or 6ths. What this means is that things that might otherwise be "wrong", such as the one 5th in the key that should be a diminished 5th turns out to be a Perfect 5th, don't bother us because we've actually heard them so many times in the past we accept this momentary nod to another key.

But again, you could have happened on a combination that doesn't do that, or if harmonized in 3rds or 6th still works out sounding OK.

Finally, playing G# melody over a C# <b><u>harmony</u></b> turns C# minor into C# Dorian - which is quite common in pop music including rock/blues based guitar (and even jazzy and folk stuff).

Some players even play Dorian solos over otherwise plain minor changes so this can actually sound "OK" to most people as well.

Just FYI, the word "harmonize" is used differently in different genres. In rock/pop it generally means to add a 2nd line above or below a melody line or riff, that "harmonizes it" at some interval, like a 3rd or 6th (or 4th or 5th sometimes). 

I assume this is what you meant when you said you added a new guitar part - probably to an existing one to make a <b><u>harmony</u></b> line.

But any way you slice it, the two keys share 6 out of 7 notes, so those 6 won't sound like anything's amiss. The other note will either do something like give it a Dorian flavor, or if you don't hit it at all in one part, it won't affect anything, and so on.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; But this is just basic jazz music. Super easy to analyze and very tonal. So I feel like there’s no difficulty at all in analyzing it.

People use "analyze" and "tonal" differently. For some, "analysis" simply means assigning Roman Numerals to each <b><u>harmony</u></b> (or just identifying it). But, just because one is able to do that easily, does not necessarily mean a piece is tonal - it absolutely can be. For some, "tonal" means, "it has notes and nameable chords". I'm thinking of it here more in terms of "style", rather than content. IOW, if a piece exhibits more non-functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> than it doesn't, or if establishes key centers by means other than functional progressions and cadences, or if it hardly ever remains in any key center or constantly obscures it, is ambiguous, or otherwise constantly modulating, and so on, it is not "tonal music" by definition. That is, by that definition. IOW, Renaissance music also has "a bunch of chords and melodies" and is in standard western tuning (at the time, and close enough to modern 12tet for our purposes) and it's "easy to analyze" - hell, not even many 7th chords - but that alone does not make it Tonal - in fact, it's Modal.

So my point is, that if you're defining "tonal" as "easy to analyze" and "has chords, and melodies", then yes, it is "tonal". But that's kind missing a lot of what "tonality" is - it's only surface elements, not the deeper stylistic elements - like what separates Modality from Tonality in the Renaissance and Baroque eras. It just seems people can't grasp the concept that if we analyze those as different, even though they share many surface features, why can't we (or why wouldn't we, or shouldn't we) analyze music that deviates enough from the deeper concepts of tonality in a different way as well - despite similarities of surface elements?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In that case, the first chord you hear is an "inverted" chord.

What that means is, the basses play some note of the chord other than the root note.

Each chord is built on a Root, then a note a 3rd above that, then another note a 3rd above that, which is a 5th above the root.

So we call those "chord members" and it's Root-3rd-5th or R-3-5 for short.

That first chord has the 3 as the lowest note.

The bass continues to descend chromatically

This produces some "odd" chords that are a little less commonly heard in a Key in music, but they're not "wrong" or anything like that - just a little less common than other things. It's like I called something "garish" the other day and that's actually not a word that's super common (anymore it seems) but it's not "wrong".

It also produces a bass line that goes down, while the little melodic idea has been one that goes up throughout the piece. This produces what we call "counterpoint" though it's only one small aspect of what counterpoint is or can be.

It's likely that you may be noticing that the bass part is "more linear" making it "more melodic" as well. That could be another reason it sounds "opposite of <b><u>harmony</u></b>". But it's not making bad or wrong harmonies, it's just doing it in a way that we haven't really heard so much in this piece or don't hear as commonly as some other moves, making it kind of fresh to the ear and in this case, fitting for a climax for the piece.

But there's not really a word for it. It's just the chords are "inverted" instead of not inverted, which is caused by this chromatically descending bass (but it could happen with it not being chromatic or ascending instead), which comes of more as melodic rather than just "roots of the chords" - which a lot of bass is.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Why isn’t the chord made from the leading tone more “anxious” to resolve into the first chord as it has the leading tone as it’s root? 

I'd say it is.

The V chord as a triad doesn't contain any dissonance, and is a stable, consonant <b><u>harmony</u></b>, it's only impetus to resolve is the presence of the Leading Tone, in a <b><u>harmony</u></b> where we've heard so much music that resolves in that way that we expect it.

The vii^o chord is unstable and includes a dissonance, though historically, in musical styles where these resolutions are expected, the vii^o is nearly always used in first inversion, which makes it slightly more stable, but still includes a dissonance thatis "more demanding" of resolution.

So I'd still say even inverted, it is in fact "more anxious".

You need to understand that most of the time these kinds of broad statements in tutorials are vastly over simplified, often simply regurgitation of things that are just always said, and even not necessarily correct - but they are often more practical to "explain away" things so people can get on with learning without getting bogged down in nit picking stuff.

FWIW, the V7 and vii^o7 chords have a similar relationship - the V7 adds a dissonance and has more of a need to resolve than the plain V, so like the vii^o , it's both the inclusion of the Leading Tone and the dissonance in the chord that's important. But, a vii^o7 (or half-diminished 7th) still has more overall instability - in fact the classic "anxious" sound is the "silent film damsel in distress tied to the railroad tracks" trope is a diminished 7th chord played in tremolo or otherwise made "nervous".

FWIW, understand that this is all about context - it's not an inherent quality of the chords. In Blues for example, the "need" for a V7 type chord to resolve is diminished to the point where that type of sound can be used as a completely stable sonority with no need whatsoever to resolve. But o7 chords in that context still remain unstable and "anxious".

So I think your question is good, but you seem to be assuming it's not more anxious - but it is in most contexts and in the way it is used. So I don't know if they specifically said that or you just assumed it.

But we tend to use the V chord more frequently so even though it may not be "the most anxious" choice, we don't always want that level of anxiety - sometimes a more subtle resolution is more effective.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;So I guess in that context, it would be triad with a 'double-diminished' fifth, although I guess it could also be assigned more convoluted inversion-based names.

No, not really. You're trying to apply one concept - Tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> - when you've already gone to using another type of <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

A "Triad" can be any "3 note chord". C-D-E is a "triad". It's a "secundal" triad if we want, but we wouldn't say it consists of a diminished 3rd (D) and triply-diminished 5th (E). That's just silly and in no way informative. It's "built" some other way than "stacking thirds".

I don't want to be harsh either, but sorry, you're that typical guy who tries to understand music not from actual music, but from numbers. While there's some relevance, it's far more minimal than you're thinking and all this stuff has already been done for you. Yes, people have used C-E-F, and C-Eb-F in pieces. It didn't take some mathematical equation for them to decide to use them. They just liked the sound. A lot of it falls in with Secundal and Quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or what was termed "wrong note <b><u>harmony</u></b>" or "added note <b><u>harmony</u></b>" in the early 20th century.

C-D-F, C-E-F, C-Eb-F, C-Db-F are all chord structures someone could use and easily play on piano or any other set of instruments on any starting pitch and it could even use chords that remain in the key.

You don't have to invoke all this "septimal" nonsense. People who make music don't care about that. They put together three notes and go "that sounds kinda cool, let's see what I can make of that" and then try it in different places and in different forms without ever having to add (mathematically) things together.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Smurfy is dead on.

In the context, the A#-[C#]-E#-G# does make sense as A#m7. That's probably what it's going to sound like, so not really any need to invoke non-tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> unless there's some other important contextual reason.

I tell you what may help - back up a fret, or 2, and the notes will be easier to deal with without having the F#.

You could just lower everything you have:

F# - "F" - G# - C# becomes (taking a # away from all notes - F is really E#, so take away from that)

F - E - G - C 

This will make them easier to figure out. Then you can transpose them all back up if you want - and the root note just takes on the sharp sign!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Welcome, but fair warning - the things you said you're looking to learn are not typically the things discussed here - especially anything that's instrument specific. Clarinet forums are really best for those things (or better, a professional teacher).

The switching between major and minor stuff is more typical here, but again a warning - a lot of people look for "why did it change here" and the answer is - disappointingly to many - "because that's the sound the composer wanted".

So not trying to chase you away or anything, but I would just say keep your expectations realistic - but since you play a "one note at a time" instrument, you may find chords and <b><u>harmony</u></b> fascinating, as that's something you typically don't play often.

Since you play both clarinet and bass clarinet, you might be interested in 2 part counterpoint and maybe even trying your hand at writing your own, and that can be rewarding and a good way to understand more about what's going on in larger scale groups. So I'd say keep an eye out for that stuff!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;because its symmetrical nature makes it the Swiss army knife of <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Best quote I've heard in a while! :-D
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;If in a major scale the relative minor chord creates tension

It doesn't.

In a Major KEY, each chord has a general "function", especially in the context of key-based tonal music using functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

ANY chord that you move from the Tonic to, creates tension in the sense that it's not the tonic, and you want to get back to the tonic.

But all of the chords do this, and the relative minor chord (vi) isn't really any different than ii, or iii for this. In fact, some chords, like V, "create more tension" in that they more strongly want to go back to I.

Think of it like a ball laying on the floor - going from I to vi is like moving the ball from where it is to another position.

Going from I to V is more like lifting the ball up in the air - if you let go, it's going back down to the floor.

Minor Keys work the same way. the C in Am is "not the tonic" so it has "some" energy, but again is more like just a slight aside, rather than the energy given by the V chord instead.

A C to Am resolution in Am is about the same as an Am to C resolution in C, but neither are particularly strong. But G to C, or E to Am, are going to be much stronger.

So I don't know where you got that "if in major scale..." part, but it's not really anything that's happening.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>

Tonic - C.

Count up - C-D-E - it's 3 away.

Count down - C-B-A - it's 3 away.

So the vi and iii are equidistant from the tonic ;-)

But yes, V to I (or V to i in minor) is considered the strongest or "most final" resolution.

That is, V7 to I is considered even more strong because the 7th on the chord introduces more dissonance, making the V want to resolve to I that much more.

The only other chord similar is the vii chords - but they aren't traditionally used in the same way V is or as often, so the "backbone" of tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> is V-I and even the whole idea of "home - not home - home" or I-V-I.

Many people see moves from I to iii or vi as merely "prolongations" of the tonic function, so they don't really "go anywhere" or provide much forward impetus. Some even see them as interchangeable with I. 


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, I'm not sure the arrangement is accurate. Hard to hear on my speakers though it's so quiet.

It's basically A Dorian.

But the melody does almost sound like it's Em, with just an Am chord underneath which could happen in the key of Em.

A Dorian is the same notes as Em.

It's hard to say with stuff like this because really it's just this very short idea that doesn't really do much to establish any kind of tonality and it's ambiguous - without it ever going anywhere else, with the A <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the melody as it is, the only real choice is A Dorian.

The arrangement has an F <b><u>harmony</u></b> sometimes which is kind of odd - I don't hear that in the little bit of the other video I listened to  - which seems to just stay on the A the whole time (but bass isn't well reproduced on my laptop).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Are you playing them against a <b><u>harmony</u></b>? If not, that's your first problem.

Find "Oye Como Va" by Santana online right now.

Play it. It's A Dorian. Play A Dorian over top. Listen to what Santana plays - they're Dorian melodic ideas. It doesn't sound like it wants to "drift to G".

Why? Because they beat you over the head with Am, and don't even play a G chord the whole song.

Major and Minor (forget Ionian and Aeolian) are beat into us from the first things we hear. We're conditioned to hear them. Undoing that is hard.

So what people do when they make music in modes is they typically avoid like the plague anything that will sound remotely like it would resolve to Major or Minor. If you're in C Mixolydian, which could drift to F Major, don't play the stinking F chord! Definitely don't play C7 to F in your progression, because that's going to sound like V7-I in F, not a C mix progression. Don't go Gm - C7 - F - that's even worse!

C to Bb and back to C. C to Gm and back. Or other similar combinations that DO NOT APPEAR in traditional Major or minor - so they can't be!

There are ways to do it melodically as well, again avoiding the trappings of Major and Minor. But you need something to "orient" the listener (and yourself) to the center of the mode - if it's C Mix, you gotta be doing stuff that keeps orienting the listener to C, not some other note.

This is why traditional Minor uses a V7 instead of v - it orients the listener to say A in Am, rather than C of C major. 

Playing C - F - G7 - C in A minor isn't going to sound at all like Am.

And playing Am - C - F - G7 may also not sound enough like Am.

But Am - Dm - E7 - Am sounds way more like like Am, and not anything like C Major.

You have to concentrate on the chords that make it sound like what it is, not what it's not! So you avoid progressions that sound like other modes.

You don't necessarily have to change the V chord as we do with Minor - but they actually did do this back in the 1400s for this very reason.

But today we can just use other methods to orient the center to the note we want - avoiding traditional progressions that are something else, and droning the center or something like that, or setting up vamps like Oye Como Va, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;  but really carefully listen and analyze what's going on? 

Yes yes yes!

&gt;Like, should I write the roman numeral analysis on the sheet music to internalize what a II V progression feels like?

Yes.

&gt;Maybe write the scale degree of the notes in melody?

Yes. And what chord member it is, or how it is or isn't part of the chord.

&gt;My technical aptitude in the piano feels way beyond my musical aptitude.

That's a good place to be. So what you need to start working on now is "paying attention to" - in greater detail - "aural detail" what is actually happening with these sounds. Can you "hear" what chord is the tonal center - you may know from theory, or from fundamentals of reading key signatures, but, just a for example - what makes a piece in C Major sound like C major, and one in A minor sound like A minor, even though the key signature is the same?

Someone who sort of blindly/mechanically plays through the piece won't think about these things - or the "whys". But, if you "pay attention" or analyze the piece, you might find - a ha - there are no C Major chords even, and the Am keeps coming up in important places! Maybe this is at least part of the reason it's in Am - and then you need to try to hear that.

There's a lot of people out there who want to compose, and some of them are quite good players. But the reason they can't learn to compose is they don't really pay attention to the sounds they're making, or more importantly, analyzing them in any way that helps them more deeply understand connections, and patterns, and so on.

Just for example, if for the month you sat down and played through all of Bach's chorales - as many as you could in an hour each day - let's say you didn't play those before and found one you liked the sound of and wanted to write something like that - that month of just playing them and paying attention to "how they sound" is going to make it much more intuitive for you to write one because you'll know "what sounds right" or not - but you wouldn't have known that from just playing one once.

Transcribing helps you to further refine your ear, and Sight Singing helps you to "internalize" sounds better, and sitting down and doing things like playing 1 note then singing a <b><u>harmony</u></b> above it, or singing the missing note of a chord you play, or singing melodic patterns you play, and so on just help each activity reinforce the others so it all comes together and becomes useful for you.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>About an infinite number of ways.

Seriously.

The simplest form is "Direct". You're in C Minor, then you just go to Am. Done.

A common way is to use the dominant chord of the key of Am, which is E(7). You can go directly from the key of Cm to an E(7) chord, or you can introduce more chords that lead up to it.

You can also "transition" using Common Tones or Common Chords.

The only chords Cm and Am share are G(7) and B^o.

Since G7 resolves deceptively to Am, you could just have your G7 from Cm resolve to Am instead of Cm.

You could treat the vii^o in Cm as ii^o in Am, and go - Cm - B^o - E7 - Am (which is equivalent to a suggestion above in terms of using more chords to prepare).

You can use a common tone, such as C, D, F, or G, and single that out. A common thing to do would be to end in Cm, repeat the single C note another time, then just start in Am with C being the 3rd of the chord. This is like a direct modulation but is smoothed over by the C being a common tone and singled out like that.

You can do a phrase modulation, where the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is left out, and a melody line abruptly or gradually introduces the notes necessary to "morph" into the new key.

You can change the mode of C Minor to C MAJOR, then it's relative to Am, and much easier as there will be more common chords.

But I shouldn't say that. It's not easier. Because there are infinite ways to do each of the things above.

What you need to do is learn to play music that has modulations in it, and see how those modulations were accomplished.

You can't really "read about modulations" and learn how to do them. You need actual reference points - examples from music itself.

Very little modern popular music does anything besides direct modulations - they hardly "modulate" at all and just simply "change keys" (I'm using modulate in the meaning that it's a longer transition rather than an abrupt one for this comparison).

Far and away the most popular modulation in classical music is a common chord modulation. But classical music doesn't typically modulate between Cm and Am.

The question is, why are you using these two keys, and why do you need to modulate between them.

And finally, it 100% depends on what kind of effect you want - do you want it to be subtle, or stand out? The method you choose to use will help you with that, but you have to understand the sounds those methods result in. Which comes from learning to play music that modulates and seeing what results these methods produce.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It can. And typically does. At least in the examples I've seen and definitions I've encountered.

It's usually a form of "Centric" music. The inclusion of all the scale degrees and various harmonies and means of creating them essentially create a center through means other than typical functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> (thus "tonal" center is not really the best word), often through repetition, static <b><u>harmony</u></b>, drones, vamps, and so on.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;These are called dyads, right?

Yes. and thank you for not calling them "diads" :-)

Traditional chords begin with 3 notes as a "triad".

You can think of a Dyad as just a "subset" of the triad.

C-E-G you could have C-E, or E-G, or C-G (Power Chord) and you could also have them in any order - so G below C, or E below C ,etc.

These have specific names that are too complex to get into right now, but we also just call them by their "generic" name like a "third" or a "sixth".

a C-E dyad is a "third" (C-D-E - 1-2-3 - see?).

So you can make Dyads out of any chords. But your last part of your question is the more complex thing - you can take a note, like Bb (which is A#, but let's use Bb) and add a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. above it to make a Dyad.

It will IMPLY some chord, but it may not be a Bb chord.

The example I gave above of C-E-G - see the E-G dyad isn't an "E" chord of some type in that context - it's a subset of a C Chord.

So we usually use the context in which they appear to better comprehend them.

IOW, a lone Dyad of "F to D" could be any number of chords - because we're not sure if the other note is Bb, B, A, or Ab, etc. So we name them differently than we do chords - it would be a "sixth" but we also use a specific name - this one's a Major 6th or "M6".

But, if it were a Dm chord these two notes were sounding as part of, then we'd say it was implying the Dm <b><u>harmony</u></b>, even though it's not a "full" chord.

______

Aside from using them as "subsets" of chords, most Dyads we encounter in a melodic context (i.e. instead of as Power Chords) is as a harmonized melody.

We take a melody, then add a 3rd above it.

So if the melody goes E-D-C-E-D-C, we add G-F-E-G-F-E above it (this is exactly what "Three Blind Mice" does BTW).

But the catch is, the added line IS FROM THE SAME KEY (or scale) as the original.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> guitar parts like you might hear in Iron Maiden (who used them extensively) or Boston (where a lot of the main lead intro lines are harmonized) do this - take a main melody and add a <b><u>harmony</u></b> line a 3rd above, or a 6th below, or some other combination (and sometimes the interval varies over the passage). Some of these will agree with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and some will not. For example, if the chord is G, and you have:

B - C - D

G - A - B

the A and C dyad isn't a G chord, but it's just "passing" between two other dyads that are part of the G chord, so we're cool with that.

So they don't always have to appear as part of a chord - they can be part of a harmonized line. Other instrumentalists - especially violinists and string players call them "double stops".

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't like the sound of that music... so the chord progression is irrelevant to me.

I love this (give it the first 40 seconds or so):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwml0jevv0

and this (maybe give it the first minute, but the first 4 chords are enough!):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dVPu71D8VI

But I also love this (which is essentially 1 chord):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0_erYcnXRM

and this (which is also basically a 1 chord vamp):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj5VODa-eTY

The reason it's such a big thing in production now is the music is pretty vapid on other aspects. A lack of musicality is made up for in chord progressions and production technology. That's nothing new, but "loop based production line" songwriting means that interest has to come from places other than melodic content for example.

But I like both - but in the absence of anything else interesting, maybe the <b><u>harmony</u></b> does need to be interesting, like the first example I posted.

But when there's so much going on like the Sly song, cramming it fully of a bunch of weird chords is counterproductive.

And I also like a good I - IV - V pop song if there's other things going on (like energy in a punk song, etc.).

IOW, I'm not going to decry anything just because it uses a simple progression - unless the simple progression doesn't fit the song. Likewise, I don't care for "hip substitutions" when they're really not called for!


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Polytonality.

Strings are in one key while winds are in a different key (or mode if you like)

It's not an Em chord.

It's B-E-B in the strings A in the winds.

Note the strings are note + 4th + 5th?

B-E-B.

B-E-A-D-C-F

what notes are in the winds combined with the strings on the first beat?

B-E-A-D - Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

B-E-A-(D-G) - C - F (or C-F-B-E-A-D)

on beat 2. See it?

Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

A - D - E (G#) to B-E-A (D-G) C

So you've actually got a couple of things happening:

Firstly, the two parts are "independent streams" in 2 ways - the winds have a melody that implies maybe A Harmonic Minor (or a mode thereof) while the strings are accompaniment playing 4th chords that simply use parallelism to go up and down pure Am (until the final chord)

The two streams are "coming together" at points to form quartal chords and at other times more complex sonorities (but because the strings are in 4ths that's still a component). Notice that the melody uses quartal melodic patterns like:

A-D-E which is inverted form of E-A-D - again with the B note in the strings, we get B-E-A-D

Notice at the 8/8 bar (finally, one used properly!) the strings slightly change to note+5th+4th but it's like a "flipped" version of the original
In the 7/8 bar it actually goes to "quartal triads":

F-B-E, then E-A-D then D-G-C then finally E-F#-B, which is still a quartal form just "inverted" if you like.

So sometimes the melodic stream is more quartal, and with the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, creates more typical quartal chords, but when the melody moves to more triadic and stepwise motion (covering a 3rd) it's less quartal and more triadic, though in this kind of situation it can be six one way half dozen the other determinig whether it's a quartal chord and higher extensions with omitted notes, or the same for a tertian chord. 

Think of it this way:

C G D A E B (in 5ths)

C F B E A D G (in 4ths)

C E G B D F A (in 3rds)

C D E F G A B (in 2nds) 

are all "voicings" of the same note content - we'd call a Major 13 in the 3rds version.

So C-F-D-G could mean the 4ths version with missing notes, or a "Csus2sus4" chord from a 3rds version.

So there's some crossover there.

The melody is sort of based on E, not unlike Hava Nagilah, and of course Lenny used a lot of Jewish folk melodies. So it has that kind of sound, but doesn't use the F.

So you're looking at Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, in the Strings, partially in the winds, and in both when combined sometimes, as well as a stream in a mode of A Harmonic Minor, and another stream in Am (or it could be E phrygian if we like, since it seems to center on E) and that makes it kind of a quasi-polytonal (or bitonal if you want to be specific since there's only two) result.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Careful with the word "functionality" as it could be taken as (and usually would be) talking about Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> specifically.

Function varies based on context - even Am7 is going to have a different function in different keys.

But, as the general word, C6 is a C chord, and an Am7 is an A chord.

C6 has "C-ness" for lack of a better term, and Am7/C has "Am-ness" despite their being the same collection of notes.

And this to is another context dependent thing.

C-E-G-A just written out on paper could be C6 or Am7/C - we just don't really know.

But if a piece is in the key of C, and it ends on C-E-G-A, it's not an Am7/C.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;I want to put together a four-part composition that will sound just as good as either a vocal piece or a string arrangement.

Then you need to spend years, even decades, learning 4 part writing techniques, studying music written this way in order to learn to do it effectively.

&gt;First: is it better to start with the melody or the chord progression?

Either.

Bach's Chorales, which are the standard teaching tool for 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b>, used existing melodies to which Bach added 3 more parts.

But 4 part music can be written as just a succession of harmonies, with various points of interest. There's polyphonic counterpoint, imitative counterpoint, and all kinds of other means of writing 4 part pieces.

You can even do what most people who haven't really learned how to do it well, and that's just come up with 4 part chords and voice them for whichever group you want.

&gt;Would it sound better if the fourth were higher (say alto) or in between the other three?

Standard 4 part writing is Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass.

Alto is typically a female voice (as is Soprano) while the others are male.

Writing for Alto, Tenor, Baritone, and Bass would be OK, but it would be a lower register. If you wanted to make this music for strings, it might not be the best register to write in because of their range.

Did you know that Viola reads Alto clef? That's because it's basically an Alto instrument. So you're trying to put your HIGHEST voice as the THIRD LOWEST instrument. It could potentially work, but it would depend on how it's written.

Likewise. Alto goes above Tenor. Period. If your Alto is always singing below the Tenor, you pretty much don't know what you're doing. Or, basically the Alto is singing the Tenor part, and the Tenor is singing the Alto part. Which won't agree with their vocal ranges at the very least.

There are probably Millions if not hundreds of millions of examples in the world. Most western music is written this way, or based on it, and there are forms of it that are very clearly laid out in 4 parts and others where it's more obscure.



</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Sean,

The comment on the top? You know everyone already knows that right? It makes it look like you don't know anything about the ensemble you're writing for, and if that's the case, maybe you shouldn't be writing for them...

Why are there chords? Is a Guitarist or Pianist going to comp along?

Get those out of there. Published String Quartets don't have chord symbols.

It wanders a lot.

It sounds a bit like you wrote it by coming up with a chord progression and making the notes fit that progression.

m 17 to the end seems more well thought out than the music before that.

The melody is definitely better, and the support makes more sense and stays out of the way.

The bass on m.9 should really start with a D because the A really robs that Dm <b><u>harmony</u></b> of the effect it would have.

You've got a lot of "random" stuff in there.

Let me put it this way - if you're going to say something, do you just throw in random words? If you were filming a movie, outside of goofy artistic experiments, would you just edit in random scenes that don't belong in the movie?

Would you introduce new characters in a novel who only come in on one page and are never seen or heard from again (who aren't just passersby on the street or something)?

Every note in your piece needs a "reason for being".

Why, for example, is that A there on the Dm chord in m.9

Is it part of some melodic motive? It may be echoing the melody, but WHY? It doesn't continue. Why for only those two notes?

Same thing earlier in m. 3 in Vn. 2 - why does it jump all the way down to the A a 9th lower when it could have just gone to the A a step down. Why is the lower A so crucial? Is it part of some melodic motive?

Wouldn't it make more sense if that measure had the same rhythm and shape that m. 1 does - especially since the Viola has the same rhythm and shape as well in both measures?

That's continuity. That's economy. That's familiarity for the listener (and player). Something they can grab on to (and play more accuragely).

Why in measure 18 is there suddenly this doubly dotted note and 32nd out of nowhere?

Is that rhythm absolutely crucial for this passage?

If you have bona fide answers to these questions (besides taking a defensive standpoint just because) then you can justify them.

But they all come of as you just stuck a note in. There's no logic, or no reason for them to be there as they are. It's what makes it sound rather random and wandering. Great if that's the effect you were after, but it doesn't seem to be.

Don't get me wrong - you've got some nice ideas.

But you really should look at some music by other composers and see how they deal with these things instead of just throwing notes in to match the chords - which is what it comes off as.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Rule 4a: Keep the common tone, move the other two notes by step in the same direction to the next nearest chord tone to complete the chord (henceforth, complete the chord means so the upper 3 voices contain one each of the R, 3, 5 which will provide RR35 since the bass is already on the R).

4b: Move the upper voices in the same direction, to the next nearest chord tone, to complete the chord, with no leaps larger than a 4th (see section below for an exception).

So the difference here with your version is it's not when you can't keep a common tone, it's when you want this! Furthermore, it can move in the same direction as the bass depending on if the bass leaps up a 4th or down a 5th. However, it's generally better for the bass to move the opposite direction if possible. There is one case where Direct 5ths can be produced and moving the bass opposite solves that. Finally, the upper voices will only work one direction with the "less than a 4th" qualifier - C-E-G can get to an F chord by upper voices going down - C-E-G down to A-C-F. But it can't go up because the next nearest chord tone for all of them is a 4th higher.

This is by the way not uncommon, and is really super common and almost exclusive at cadences where the soprano moves 2-1.

4c. The "Parallel 10ths Rule": this is one you don't have - keep the common tone, move the 3rd of the first chord to the 3rd of the 2nd chord, and move the remaining tone by step to complete the chord. So if you were going from C to F, the E in the C chord would jump to the A of the F chord. This moves a chord from open position to close position (in the upper voices) or vice versa. G-C-E  would move to F - C - A notice the C is kept (common tone), the 3rd of chord 1 moves to the 3rd of chord 2 (E up to A) and the G moves by step to F (to complete the chord - so not to A). 

This last one is actually more common than you'd think, and many people don't teach it at all! But it also has to be a certain voicing for it to work to begin with. The 3rd has to be in the Soprano and able to jump up, or in the tenor and be able to jump down so it's the rarest of the types.
_____
Rule 3 (if you' haven't gotten it by now, the numeral refers to the root movement distance!): Keep the two common tones, move the remaining note to complete the chord.

Yours reads a little differently because you said "move the noteS stepwise". But it's only one note that moves. There are TWO common tones in the upper parts, so the ONE remaining one is all that's left - that's the one that goes stepwise to complete the chord. Most people don't include this, but it's going to move opposite of the bass if the bass moves a 3rd (not a 6th - which should be avoided in most cases anyway).

It is possible to use the "Parallel 10ths" rule for this one as well, but it's pretty rare and again, can only happen under certain conditions.

E - G

C - B

G - E

C - E

Notice again, the 3rd of the first chord moves to the 3rd of the 2nd chord.
____
Rule 2: The three upper voices move in opposite direction of the bass to the next nearest chord tone to complete the chord (it's assumed that the bass moves by 2nd, never 7th here).

Rule 2x - "x for "exception" - In a V-VI progression in Minor, the Leading Tone MUST move UP. This will cause the resulting VI chord to be doubled R335. In Major, the Leading Tone  MUST move UP **when it is in the Soprano** but **MAY** also move up if it's in the inner parts. However, this means it may move down as in the "normal" rule 2 when in Alto or Tenor.

When leaving from a VI (or vi) chord with a doubled 3rd, all bets are off and you don't follow the rules here, but have to follow basic counterpoint rules to regain correct doubling (RR35) on the next (root position) chord.

Yours would say better, "2 of the upper voices" instead of "the 2 upper voices" which implies that it's the Soprano and Alto specifically.

But otherwise this is all pretty similar to yours.

"Parallel 10ths" is possible:

E - F

C - A

G - D

C - D

But remember again this is pretty rare, and only works in certain voicings and positions.

_____

For all of these where the root moves, mis-doubling the chord can be a possibility, but whenever that happens the "rules don't apply".

However, one super common one worth mentioning is "4x"  - which is 4b with the Leading Tone.

In a V-I cadence at the end of a piece or section, the Leading tone MUST go up if it's in the Soprano. If so, this will result in a **Tripled Root**:

B - C

G - E

D - C

G - C

Notice it's kind of like the regular "2" rule where all of the voices move the same direction (which is the same as "4b") where the Leading Tone is an issue in V-VI and V-vi.

And it has a similar qualification as the Major rule in V-vi: If the Leading Tone is in an inner part, it **MAY** still ascend to produce the tripled root if you want. It only HAS to when it's in the Soprano, but it **MAY** do it in an inner voice as well. However, in an inner voice, it may go down as well, which is just the regular "4b" rule above.

So both of our "exceptions" are when the Leading Tone is in the Soprano - it must go up in V-VI in ANY voice, and MUST go up in V-vi when it is in the Soprano, and it MAY do so in the inner parts but doesn't have to, and in V-I or V-i when using rule 4b, it MUST go up in the Soprano and MAY go up when it's in an inner voice but doesn't have to.

In all cases, whenever the Leading Tone goes up when it should have otherwise gone down based on the non-excepted rule, it will produce a mis-doubling. In the V-VI(vi) progression it's a double 3rd. In the V-I(i) case it's a Tripled Root. Both of these can be corrected in the next chord.
_____

Rule 1: Repeated chords. 1a: Repeat "as is" with or without the Bass moving up or down an octave as space permits. 

1b: Move all upper voices up, or down to the next nearest chord tone in the same direction to complete the chord (again, bass may repeat or jump octave)

E - G

C - E

G - C

C - C

1c: "voice exchange" - this is similar to the "Parallel 10ths" rule in that it moves a close position chord to an open position one:

E - G

C - C

G - E

C - C

Note the G and E "exchange places". This can also happen when chords are inverted, but I don't see any need to mention that when still talking about root position chords.

1d: pretty much you can get away with a lot more with a repeated chord if you want, but "less movement" is generally preferred. But it can also be a good opportunity to re-voice a chord (like one that was misdoubled because of a V-VI movement) and the "rules" of counterpoint don't apply to repeated <b><u>harmony</u></b>. You could jump all 4 voices up an octave in parallel it you wanted to.

______

The rest of what you have is pretty accurate.

1st inversion chords don't really have any "rules" and any note may be doubled.

But another way to think of this is, a complete triad may appear in the upper 3 voices in close or open position in each of the upper 3 voices' own inversion.

E - C-E-G; E - E-G-C; E - G-C-E;  E - C-G-E; E - G-E-C, and so on.

Likewise, you can have various forms of RR5 or R55 on top:

E - C-G-C; E - G-C-C, and even E - GG-C (G unison) or E - G-G-C (G octave).

You just have to be careful the further apart those upper voices get the more likely you are to exceed the vocal ranges or cause "holes" in the texture (like when Soprano and Alto or Alto and Tenor are an octave apart).

Thus it's most common to see a complete triad in close position in the upper parts, or the R-5-R or 5-R-5 configurations. Two voices on the same pitch is also pretty common as it keeps the texture compact. The open spaced triads (like in 6ths) and any octave between parts are the rarest kinds in general (but you'll still find them regularly, especially if the next chord lets the notes move back into a better range).

Yes, Diminished chords have to be handled carefully.

And don't double the Leading Tone.

Side note there: The Leading Tone is a FUNCTIONAL LT, not just scale degree 7. So on a iii^6 chord, the 7th scale degree is in it - it could be doubled (though still often isn't in favor of one of the other doublings) as long as it doesn't have a melodic tendency to resolve to the Tonic in a way that would cause parallels. Likewise, it doesn't apply to the Subtonic on a (b)III^6 chord in minor.

6/4 chords. Double the Bass :-). Even the one that doesn't mention it - the Arpeggiated kind - well it still usually doubles the bass!

The one thing people need to learn about 6/4 chords:

DO NOT USE THEM **EXCEPT** in these very specific places. A lot of students, when you finally get to 6/4 chords in theory class, want to put a 6/4 in on every single chance the get.

6/4 chords are ONLY used in these very specific circumstances, and if you use them outside of that, they're probably wrong (in as much as CPP practice dictates).

Here's a bonus:

The PRIMARY 6/4 chords are going to be I, IV, or V with rare exceptions that are not worth worrying about until you know all this stuff cold.

Passing - **V6/4** between I and I^6, or **I6/4** between IV and IV^6. 

Neighbor (Pedal) - **IV6/4** between I chords, or **I6/4** between V chords. 

Cadential - **I6/4** only.

Arpeggiated 6/4 can happen on all chords (careful with diminisheds) and especially when it's a "root 5th" alternating bass pattern it's more likely to be on other chords. But the whole Arpeggiated Bass thing is really more about the "real" position of the chord (like often on beat 1) and the other inversion in that case is not a "true" inversion, but just  - well - an arpeggiation.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Actually, you kind of don't really "use" scales! (well, you do, but read on)

Scales are like the Alphabet - your make words from the alphabet, and stories from the words, the Alphabet is really just a "listing" of the letters in the language.

Likewise, a Scale is a "listing" of the notes in the Key.

So "Key" is actually the far more important concept.

That said, you can "play a scale"  - which is playing the notes of the key in order (sort of like reciting the alphabet) but music isn't generally made up of just running up and down scales any more than you encounter the entire alphabet or even just strings of consecutive letters in text.

Of course this is not a direct parallel and I'm oversimplifying for the sake of demonstration but for the most part, the Scale, which is the notes of the Key, is really more a "resource" for making Melodies and Chords, and other pitch-based musical elements.

_____

I'll expand on the other post with an example:

The Key of G Major consists of the notes G A B C D E and F#

From those notes, you could make a melody, like that for "Amazing Grace", which is D-G-B-B-A-G-E-D (simplified). But you can see you're not really "playing a scale" so much as "playing some of the notes from the scale, in a particular order.

Likewise, the Chords used to accompany Amazing Grace also come from the Key, or we could say, are made up of notes from the Scale.

There's a G chord, which consists of G - B - D and for the part I wrote out above, a C Chord, which is C - E - G - and if you look at the "scale listing" above for G Major, you'll see each of those chords are made up from notes of the scale (every other note as a matter of fact, starting on the letter that's the name of the chord).

When you play the melody on the mandolin you simply play the notes for the melody.

Now, knowing how to PLAY a particular scale on the Mandolin (or any instrument) can be helpful because you'll know which - in this case - frets are part of the scale and which aren't so are more likely to hit the correct notes (or, have to think less about them once the scale becomes motor memory).

But you could play the melody by knowing the notes without ever really knowing what scale or key they come from. More on that in a minute.

On Mandolin, a G chord would be 0-0-2-3 from low to high - that would be the notes D, G, B, and G - so see, there are the 3 notes of a G chord (G-B-D) with an additional G (which doesn't really change the name of the chord, but just the sound a little). There are other ways to play a G chord, but that's the common beginner version.

C is 0-2-3-0 which is G-E-C-E - again, all three notes we need for C, with an additional E note (again there are other "more advanced" ways to play the chord, but they'll still have some combination of C, E, and G).

It turns out you can accompany the entire melody of Amazing Grace with chords from the Key of G (when the melody is in G) and you only really need 3 chords - G, C, and D, though people also often use an Em chord - but all 4 of those chords are made up from notes of the key of G Major as is the Melody (or you could say, they use notes of the G Scale).

_______

Not all songs stay in one key or stick to one scale - sort of like our using letters from other alphabets sometimes - like "ç" or symbols from elsewhere, like "ø", or even words from foreign languages. So I can write primarily in English, but say a piece is an "Etude" which is originally French.

So you can be primarily in one key, but use notes here and there from other keys, and so on. Music can be all in one key, or move from one key to a different key, or intermix things from various keys. Just depends on the effect someone wants.

But usually, when beginning, it's best to stick to things in a single key where the notes of a single scale can be used. But again, if you're playing pre-composed melodies and chords, you kind of don't need to know what key they come from, only play the right notes!

But if you want to improvise, or add embellishments, or add notes to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> etc. then it becomes way more helpful to understand your Keys and Scales - for example, if the song had a D chord in it, I could know if I wanted to add one more "every other note" to the chord, it would be a C, because that's in the key. It makes a D7 chord and will sound fine in this context - since the note's already in the key, it's going to go with everything else.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; I can't feel the next chord

Marty McFly called and want's his time machine back! Of course you can't predict the future!!!

If you're playing "songs" with specific chord structures, then you simply have to know the song to be able to predict the changes.

Now, you could have said, "I heard this song on the radio a number of times but have never played it, but I know it changes chords every measure" or something like that.

So you don't have to "know" it sometimes and only be "familiar" with it to at least be able to predict changes.

Once I was at a gig and the lead singer calls "Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain". I'm not a country music fan but I had heard it over my life a few times so I had a general gist.

But I had played enough country music (and paid attention to this fact) that I knew it often went up to the IV chord for the bridge. And sure enough, this one did, so I was able to predict that.

I played with a band recently where we needed a sub on bass for the gig - they got the songs in advance and learned them, but asked if they could be to my left so they could see my fingers!

IOW, if you don't know the song, how can you play it? Basically, the more familiar you get with it - from having heard it once or twice to having heard it regularly to having played it in a band once years ago to knowing the song really well - the more accurately you can play.

What I would ask now is, when they called "that Robbie Milsap thing" did you then go home and learn that song? And then did you learn how to transpose it to C? Because that's the kind of "homework" you need to put in to be able to do this successfully on the fly (assuming a song is called that's familiar).

So what you most likely need to do is just sit down and learn all the Eagles songs, and Roadhouse Blues, and other similar things that are likely to get called.

Until then, or even in the future, what you do is develop strategies for making it easier on you when trying to "keep up".

For example, if I say "funky blues vamp in E" then what you need to learn is "vamp" means a repeated pattern, "funky" describes rhythm, and E of course gives you the key. But, if you were to play along, 1 2 3 4 E. That's what you do. Play E on beat 1. If you're not sure what else to do, play E on every 1.

Then if it sounds like it's just going to stay on E the whole time and not change chords, you can get more creative with the rhythm - E....EE.....E......EE..... and so on. Heck, with bass, even if I changed to G and A in funky chord shapes you could possibly still get away with laying on the E!

But it kind of sounds like you might be under the impression that you should just be able to walk in and "keep up" by listening as you go. Nope. Very few people can do that - only people with lots and lots of experience playing. And then, it's easier for a melody instrument because with Bass, if you play a note on beat 1 it might imply a chord change, when there was note, but a guitarist can pretty much play any note they want over an E <b><u>harmony</u></b> and they can get away with it.

Drummers of course can just lay down a rhythm.

But what you need to do is either lay out, or keep it very simple, or wait until beat two to play, until you get the progression down (in a vamp kind of thing).

But if it's a song where things are constantly changing, and you're playing it like the recording, then you just simply need to know the song or be generally familiar enough with it and have a good enough ear to get things on the fly.

A really good ear will help you more too, because if they change to a higher chord and you can "ear out" the change, you'll know more quickly where to go - a beat later or the 2nd time around.

But all of what I'm talking about comes with learning to play songs, and paying attention to what it is you're doing in them, so you can "translate" what you learn from one song to other similar songs and recognize patterns and common moves, etc.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's a long evolutionary process, but some time around the 1500s.

Prior to roughly 1600, we used a Modal System that had Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, and Mixolydian, and Plagal versions of those modes, called the 8 Ecclesiastical Modes.

Their half and whole step structure evolved from the earlier Greek modes (and potentially other influences like Middle Eastern Tonoi and so on).

In the Renaissance - roughly the 1400s and 1500s, The modes were evolving towards something the more closely represents what we call Major and Minor today.

A scholar called Glaeanus who lived during that period started noticing the "old" modes were actually being used in new ways that essentially created some "new" modes. He kept the Greek naming tradition and called these Ionian and Aeolian. There were two versions of each, so he added 4 more to the existing 8 so that there were 12 modes - he called his book "Dodecachordon" because of this.

In an oversimplified sense, what happened was that the minor modes of Dorian and Phrygian kind of "morphed" into Aeolian - what we call Minor, and Mixolydian and Lydian morphed into Ionian - what we call major.

By the 1600s, really, the older modes (and the Plagal versions of them) kept getting adjusted with accidentals so much that they ended up being Aeolian and Ionian.

This is a process that evolves over time. For example, there are scholars who argue that a piece is in Lydian, or Ionian, and some that argue the same piece is in both modes simultaneously during that time.

But what ultimately happens is the 8 (or 12) modes are basically "neutered" and morph into these other two primary "modes", which we abandon the modal terminology and call Major and Minor (there's also a big change in the way <b><u>harmony</u></b> is tonal centers are treated so we consider this part of Tonality, rather than the earlier Modality).

So no one really "decided" that Minor would be that pattern of half and whole steps - it just kind of "happened". 

People liked the way some scales sounded, then they got kind of tired of them, so they started messing with them, and created some new scales, which was new uncharted territory to explore, so they used them and abandoned the old ones (for all intents and purposes).

Same thing happened in the 1800s. People got tired of Major and minor, and started messing with them - making Whole Tone, "Overtone" and other types of scales, as well as "re-discovering" the modes and using them.

We just kind of learn things from the Tonal era standpoint, so it's "Major and Minor" as the "defaults" if you like. And no one usually teaches how we got there from the earlier modes so a lot of people don't know that happened.

But how we got to that pattern of whole and half steps - natural evolution over a long period of time back in the Renaissance.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, learn to play the guitar is probably the best answer.

The next best is to learn as much as you can about it.

But maybe the best solution is that there's actually not necessarily any reason to play the exact same voicing - I mean, it's kind of not what we do.

On some level, you could say, if you're just going to use the same voicings, why bother with guitar at all (I know I know, yeah, a different sound, but with different sound by nature comes different voicings).

Do you have a friend who plays guitar that can play things while you  play them at the piano?

I play both, but here's what I'll say:

1. I never really expect anything I play on piano to be played with the same exact voicings on guitar. It's basically unrealistic. It's possible to do in some cases, but not typical, nor for me, really desirable (though I might want that sound once in a while for special effect).

2. It's somewhat easier to play guitar voicings on piano, but again it's not necessarily something I'd want typically.

3. Usually, Guitarists are going to want you to take a piano part, convert it to <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and just tell them what chords to play, and they'll decide how to play it based on the style or feel of the song. You can ask them to play "high note chinky chinky stuff" or "chinks on 2 and 4", or "power chords", or "palm muted 8th notes" and so on if you know what that stuff is (which is why familiarizing yourself more with guitar would be beneficial). But if you just tell them the piano part goes G - Em - C - D, that's what they're going to play - in whatever way they feel like doing it.

4. Unless you're composing for classical guitar or other "composerly" pursuits for guitar, it's kind of senseless to "write out" guitar parts. Again, general ideas of what you want are good, but let the expert figure it out! At least until you're that expert. I mean I suppose it's fine if you're doing a musical or a transcription or something, but really, just general guidelines are all you want, and let them come up with the part. Unless you're paying them. Then you can tell them exactly what to do.

5. Just as there are many ways to play a C chord on Piano, there are many ways on guitar. A few of those will be the same, but many won't. It's just something you have to accept and instead of fighting it, learn how they interact so you can use them more effectively. In some songs, guitar basically just "plays the same thing as piano" while other times it plays completely different voicing and rhythms. You should listen to songs and pay attention to the two parts and see what they do. That'll go a long way to helping you get the kinds of sounds you're after.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Each chord is Mixolydian.

Or at least, that's how it's often treated.

IOW, if in C, you'd play C mix over the I chord, F mix over the IV chord, and G mix (which is C Major) over the V chord.

This is one common strategy.

There's a little bit of a difference in the way Jazz players (at least modern ones) treat Modality and the way pop musicians treat modality.

Jazz players tend to use a chord-scale approach, where each <b><u>Harmony</u></b> takes its own mode.

In pop music, you're more likely to get all of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> derived from a single mode.

12 Bar blues is generally more of the Jazz approach (though some minor blues are more pure Dorian, using a minor i and major IV which both fit the mode).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I suppose in part, a lot of people who understand things understand them well because they not only know the "superficial" elements, but the "backstory" as well.

And they probably want to convey that to others. It may help them be able to convey the information better.

I know I constantly encounter people on these forums who can't wrap their head around something because they are missing the "backstory" and when that is told to them, suddenly, they get it.

Someone just asked a question about the common "what key am I in" issue and one concern they had was that answers always seemed "dodgy".

Well, that's because the question itself is flawed, and the supposition that there's a cut and dry answer is flawed.

I think, we as tutors feel the need to "explain away" a lot of the side issues to help the person understand why we can't just give a straightforward answer.

_________

The problem with writing music is, at this point, you can do anything. "There are no rules in art" is a common thing you hear. But the problem is, most people NEED some kind of structure to work in to get started.

So what I'm about to tell you is just ONE approach and not the only approach, but based on my personal experience about what most people want to do I'll give you my thoughts on the matter. YMMV

_________


1. Pick a Key. Let's say, G Major.

2. Either write a melody in G major, and add chords to it, or write a Chord progression and add a melody to it. The latter is more common today in popular music. The chords and melody should both come from notes of G Major.

Working on the latter method, let's pick 4 chords. They could be random, or could be from another song. In fact, we're going to use the common "looping" idea that's ubiquitous today:

G - D - Em - C

Now, each chord is going to be 4 beats long.

Your melody can be anything you want. But, over the G chord, you want it to be primarily the notes of the G chord, but other notes of the key can be included.

G-A-B-G  = one note per beat. G B and G are all going to go with the chord. A passes by fast enough that it's not going to sound horrible.

Over the D chord, since I just ended on G, I'm going to go down to F#. I want some "Musical unity" so I'm just going to do the same idea, this time, F#-G-A-F#.

Again, the F# and A and F# are all part of the chord. the G is ok because it passes by. We also just heard it in the previous chord.

Now, I could continue this idea - move down a step and go E-F#-G-E with the same results - that gives me LOTS of unity, but little variety other than pitch level. So I thing I'm going to change it up.

E half note, G-B - just the notes of the chord. Rhtymic variety from what's happened. Different pattern from what's happened.

For the next chord, C, I'll just move that B up to C and hang on it for the whole measure. Or, I might go, C-G-E - reverse of the direction I just did on the Em chord, same rhythm (unity), change of direction (fresh idea).

That's how you write a melody to a chord progression.


Maybe you should forget all this "base" and "horizontal" and "vertical" stuff.

You have chords - <b><u>harmony</u></b> - that accompanies a melody, and that's pretty much it.

_______

What you need to do with this knowledge is go to other songs and learn them, and see how they deal with these issues - some melodies are more chordal, some are more scalar, and some are any mixture in between. Just depends on how much unity or variety and what kind of sound the composer wants.

The classic way to work on this is just loop that progression of 4 chords over and over again, trying out different melodic moves over top, and write down what you like and try to remember those moves for the future.

Then do stuff like, "what if I change the Em chord to an Am chord" - try it and see.

Then Wash and Repeat :-)

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, the Circle of 5ths is really about KEYS not chords.

The Key of C Major and F Major differ by only 1 note, so they sound more similar than dissimilar.

But a C *chord* and F *chord* share only 1 note and sound more dissimilar than similar.

This may be way those "4th" progressons became so important in Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - there's a "connection", but enough "newness" - compare thise with C to Em - which shares TWO notes - seems like less of a functional motion, and C to Dm - which share NO notes - which is just a drastic change.

The *notes* would be a different thing altogether. A C note and F note are two different notes. They don't really "share" anything.

Now, C to G is more closely related than C# to G just because of dissonance.

But we would probably feel that any note that forms a consonance with C is "more closely related" than one a tritone away. C - G, C - E, C - F, C - D, and C to A are all notes from C Major (those are the tonics of adjacent keys on the circle of 5ths and their relative minors tonics).

These also BTW form all the Major and Minor triads in C (note no B^o ).

But I would be people feel a great affinity for C and E together. Maybe more than C to G.

And don't forget that if you're just talking notes, G is next to D sure, but D also appears in the key of F (as its relative minor) "2 spokes" away.

So I don't really see any real basis in this, or really, any reason to point it out. It's not really the way music is made so it's really just more of an observation of a relationship that really doesn't have much to do with anything in actual music.

It's kind of like some people get all caught up in whether C to F is a consonance or dissonance and why, but it kind of doesn't really matter because it gets used in pieces in various ways regardless. And then you get extra notes tacked on and it kind of makes it a moot point.

Cheers
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; I don't think I actually learned much at all.

You just included tons of stuff in the previous paragraph - so I'd say you did learn plenty.

Whether it's applicable in a way you'd want it to be is of course a different issue :-)

Analysis is really usually the realm of "Music Theory" courses.

"Music Appreciation" more typically just covers broader things - more of history and general historical trends.

Analysis typically involves looking at a piece and identifying the key, and the chords, what inversions they're in if any, and then usually talking about where cadences are, if it modulates, how its structured (form, like Binary or Ternary form) and then into how the melody interacts with the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, if there's rhythmic or melodic motives, motivic development, and so on.

I think what a lot of people kind of misunderstand is that "naming the chords" is "analysis". It's part of it, but it usually doesn't tell you much more than what the chords are.

But really, when you analyze music, you generally focus on one thing to help you understand it better, or, for example, to point a particularly interesting characteristic of a piece and so on.

So like, if you're trying to learn more about how melodies interact with harmonies, you'll need to identify the harmonies, then figure out if the melody notes are chord tones or not, and which ones are used where and how.

but you may not need to go in depth about form, or whether the piece is contrapuntal or not in that particular instance.

If you're trying to learn about chords though, analyzing the chords in pieces is a good way to start - you do enough from the same style and you'll start seeing patterns over and over again - like, "oh, hey, if there's a chord between G and Em it's very often D/F# and rarely F#m". And then you can ask yourself questions like "well why might that be" and try to answer them in a way that helps you understand it more deeply.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, most noticeably, we might say that the "base" harmonic unit of Classical (CPP) music is the Triad, while in Jazz it's a "Tetrad" (or Quartad).

In Jazz, that includes 7th chords but also things like 6 chord (C6, Cm6).

We could even go so far as to say most jazz (comparatively speaking) consciously avoids the plain triad in most circumstances!

"Classical" <b><u>harmony</u></b> expands greatly during and after the Romantic Period, so chords with alterations and extensions become more commonplace. But we might say this is still the exception rather than the rule in most "Classical" music. 

By contrast, in Jazz, while it starts of a little simpler, it quickly gets into extensions of 9ths and higher, with more alterations (but of course it was probably drawing on contemporaneous <b><u>harmony</u></b> to some degree - the Dominant 9ths so common with French Impressionist composers were probably "picked up" by Jazz writers just from hearing them).

All of this is of course dependent on time frame - the earliest Jazz may be harmonically much simpler than some classical (post-Romantic) music of the same time frame. Schoenberg and Bartok and Stravinsky were already writing music in the teens and 20s that surpassed most of the "ragtime, march, brass band, quadrille, etc. descended music" that more directly begat Jazz.

Of course now though, there have been 12-Tone Jazz compositions and "Free Jazz" and "Experimental Jazz" and so on, so it has become as diverse as modern concert music, but in pockets, rather than in widespread practice.

And obviously, there's a lot of crossover. In the 1950s and 60s Hollywood started mixing the Korngold classical type tradition with the Mancini Jazz elements to produce an interesting mix of the two (which also eventually incorporates rock and sadly, disco, in interesting ways too)


Another big difference is Classical music still generally retains a more linear origin while a lot of Jazz is more vertically based. IOW, in Classical music, harmonies and harmonic motion are still tightly bound with the concepts of Part-Writing and Counterpoint, including Resolution of Dissonance, which Jazz tends to deal with more freely (or not at all). Jazz becomes more about the harmonic unit as a standalone entity - some of the classical concepts are sometimes present (just like using a 7th chord is common to both) but the ideas of resolution and voice leading - while still present in decent quantity, are comparatively less important or less a guiding principle of harmonic motion. Instead, it's more about "sound".

Same with Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - it's widely present in Jazz, but there's also a lot more instances of non-functional progressions than in CPP music (again, this would differ with later post-Romantic pieces and so on).

Really though, there's actually a lot of similar, especially at the time when they co-exist - like ht aforementioned dominant 9ths in Impressionism. It's why Ravel and Gershwin could get on so splendidly.

Truth be told, they are probably more similar in <b><u>harmony</u></b> than in other aspects - instrumentation, rhythm (syncopation, swing, feel), improvisation, and so on. Again that is not to imply that classical music doesn't also contain those elements, but by and large, they are more a part of the "core" of jazz and more the exception in CPP music on a *comparative* scale.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I was thinking about the octave before too and I think maybe they wouldn't pick that because it's too extreme.

If C4 was your original note, they might think C5 or C3 is just too high or too low.

And that kind of also goes with my idea of "splitting the difference" - maybe they sort of hold the original, but hear it could be the octave, but "average" the two and get the 4th or 5th, which is midway.

It's an interesting experiment though.

I think a better argument might be along the lines of this:

In the earliest monophonic music, we believe boys would double the men at the octave by nature.

But the reason the 4th and 5th might have started in Parallel Organum is possibly because someone's hearing mechanism or vocal reproduction and hearing mechanisms are off

When I was an undergrad, another student could not sing a note on pitch in sight-singing class to save his life. He was always a 5th off.

It's like he either heard the note higher, or he heard the overtone, or when he sang, he heard the fundamental, or whatever.

We test people's pitch matching ability in auditions so when a student comes in we'll play a note on piano and they'll sing it back.

Usually most people do fine but every once in a while we get someone who just can't match pitch - but usually it's randomly off from the note in either direction, or they sometimes just literally sing the same note back (like G3) no matter what note is played fo them!

This guy in class though was consistently a 5th off. I mean, when we told him, and he tried to correct it, he could sometimes get it, but it was just like he automatically jumped up a 5th.

Now, this is neither here nor there, and we lived in a different cultural landscape back then, but he was Pacific Islander descent and one of the professors said that was actually common in their experience. So I don't know if that's true or not but it would also be a fascinating study.

At any rate, I imagine maybe at some point some Monks just couldn't get the right pitch and were off a 5th.

And someone finally said, "hey, that sounds kind of cool" and then just tried replicating it and we ended up with Parallel Organum (and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, by accident!)

What's interesting about Organum is that it in some ways contradicts the whole Harmonic Series idea because it was common to add a 5th or 4th BELOW the original voice.

With the octave, this means you get C-G-C or C-F-C - and the C-F-C seems to make less sense from an overtone standpoint - like "let's sing the fundamental that this note we're singing is the 12th of"!!! It just seems like an odd way to come by it.

But again, maybe this "defect" in some people made it more easy to produce those notes - which are from a Ratio standpoint closer (or simpler) so that could have happened.

Of course, Florid Organum kind of starts using all kinds of other intervals at the beginning and end and some in the middle, so that kind of shows even if there is some kind of natural tendency, we choose to do things in spite of that in art.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>F - F - E

A - C - C

The F is a suspension. It is **Prepared** as a Consonance (6th with A, or as a chord tone as part of an F chord for example), then we have the **Suspension** itself (which forms a dissonance with the lower note - 4th with F, or again, we could say it was a non-chord tone and "supposed to be" a C chord at this point), and then the **Resolution** which is the F moving to a consonance (or chord tone of the C chord) of E (a 3rd).

We would call this a 4-3 Suspension because the Suspension itself is a 4th and it resolves to a 3.

There are really only a few types, because only certain dissonances and resolutions are possible:

D - D - C

G - C - C

This is 9-8

____

B - B - A

G - C - C

This is 7-6

___

F - F - E

A - C - C

This is 4-3

______

E - D - D

C - C - B

This is the so-called "Bass Suspension" or 2-3 suspension. Notice that unlike the others, the numerals INCREASE and this is because it's the BASS voice that has the suspension and moves away from the upper part on resolution.

If you lay these all out, you get:

9-8 | 7-6 | 4-3 | 3-2

So it's almost numerical order, with no "5-4" for example.

____

There is something called the "consonant suspension" or sometimes just a "suspension figure" - which is also used when something looks and acts like a suspension, but it doesn't meet the consonant/dissonant or chord tone/ non-chord tone parts of the definition.

The one "named" one is 6-5 - 6 and 5 are both consonances so it's not a "true" suspension, but, in a <b><u>harmony</u></b>, the 6 could be a non chord tone:

A - A - G

F - E - E

C - C - C

So the middle chord is not *really* an Am chord, but a C chord with a non-chord tone of A, which looks and acts like a suspension, so called the "consonant suspension" or sometimes just 6-5 suspension, or also "the 6-5 suspension figure" and similar names.

Note that context is important in this one to determine that the middle chord is not really an Am chord. But it clearly happens in music (albeit rarely comparatively speaking).

______

There is something called a "Suspension with a Change of Bass" which would look something like:

D - D - C

G - C - E

So the 9-8 suspension becomes a "9-6" because the bass moves up to E. This happens more in contrapuntal textures and we're more likely to just put "9-8" based on the relationship to the bass note during the suspension and what it's resolution would have been if the bass note didn't move away (which in this case could still be a C chord just in first inversion).

___

As you know, Retardations are essentially "upward resolving suspensions" and while they might be named as numerals in figured bass, we don't usually use names for retardations - at least not in my experience. But could have a 7-8 Retardation like so:

B - B - C

G - C - C

____


One thing to keep in mind is that the Sus is named from the bass note it's making the dissonance with (even when it's the bass suspension). Thus the following:

D - D - C

A - G - G

F - E - E

Is a 7-6 suspension because the E-D distance is 7 that resolves to E-C as 6.

It's not a 9-8 suspension because D is the "9th of the C chord" and C is the "8 of the C chord".

So even though we may be talking about non-chord tones for suspensions in chords, we don't name it for the "chord member" but for the distance from the bass.

_____

Writing them in <b><u>harmony</u></b> exercises is a bit of a trick.

You'd have to look for a melody (if it's given) that is like C-C-B (or C-C-D for a retardation) and then put under than a <b><u>harmony</u></b> that the B is part of.

Assuming C, the likely culprit would be a G chord.

C - C - B

? - G - G

The ? will then need to be some chord that the C is part of. So it could be a C chord.

It's helpful to know that the suspension itself can't be doubled. So in 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b>:

C - C - B

G - G - G

E - D - D

C - G - G

Notice the first and last chord move as if they were one after the other - typical "keep 1 common tone other 2 voices move by step" when the roots are a 4th apart (C to G). It's just that the C is "held over into" the G chord. So the rest of the voices often move (assuming no change of bass or <b><u>harmony</u></b> etc.) as they would if the suspension was not there.

Another helpful thing in writing them is the numbers - if you're given a bass line and have to write suspensions, you need to look for a 9, 7, or 4 over the bass (the bass suspension you would have to look for a pattern like D-D-C in the bass). Then you check to see if it can go down to 8, 6, or 3 over the same bass/chord.

It takes some practice to be able to spot places where they can go in given melody or bass line. But if you're filling in your own parts you can put them anywhere.

Just watch out for the 2-3 suspension - it's the trickiest of the bunch.

Direct (Phrase) Modulation

Enharmonic Modulation

Common Tone Modulation

Sequential Modulation

"Melodic" Modulation - this last one has various names but it's when the modulation occurs in melody alone without <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the addition of various accidentals effects the modulation.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I guess if we could put it a broad way, Passing Tones should move at a pace quicker than the harmonic rhythm.

They must pass between tones of the same chord, or, they must pass from a chord tone in one chord to a chord tone in the next chord. Exceptions are comparatively rare.

Usually, a passing tone is half or less than the rate of harmonic change.

Given 4 beats - pretend the repeated note is tied, and this is all over a C chord:

C - C - D - E

C - D - E - E

are more common than

C - D - D - E

But the latter is not impossible.

However, the further to extremes you go with this, the less idiomatic it will be (in styles where these things matter). In 8ths now:

C-D-D-D-D-D-D-E would be pretty rare over a single C chord.

But it doesn't have to be:

C-C-C-D-E-E-E-E

or

C-C-C-C-C-C-D-E

(though it could for both)

or

moving on to a new chord where E would be a chord tone:

C-C-C-C-C-C-C-D | E

(again, it could be)

but again, the opposite would be rare:

C-D-D-D-D-D-D-D | E

or even in quarters again:

C-D-D-D | E is going to be less common than:

C-C-C-D | E

or 

C-C-D-D | E


In 3/4, the same is generally true:

C-C-D | E is going to be more common than:

C-D-D | E (but could happen)

and in 8ths:

C-D-D-D-D-D | E would be extremely unidiomatic, but:

C-C-C-C-C-D | E would be more common.

So they can be quick, but they are usually half or shorter the duration of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> rather than more than half and usually happen between the two chord tones or closer to the **destination** chord tone rather than starting closer to the chord tone it's departing from (remember, we're talking *comparatively* here - there can be hundreds of passing tones in a single piece so when you look at all of even just classical music, there will be - I don't know billions - millions of billions? - so you can still find the rarer ones here and there - they're still an exception, not the rule).

A passing tone in 4/4, with one chord in the measure, is going to be more likely 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, and 4/8s of the measure, than the higher fractions. The higher ones are possible, but just get more unidiomatic the higher you get.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, if the underlying chord is C, then it would be Cadd9. It would only be C9 if the underlying chord were C7.

But think of it this way - definitely, if we hear a C chord with a C, and any emphasis on B or Bb that then moves on to the A in an F chord, then we'll probably hear that as a change from C to Cmaj7 or C7.

So the same could be true of a D over a C7 chord.

That can absolutely depend on duration but if you're analyzing Common Practice Period music, 9ths are considered unidiomatic - they happen, especially more close to the 20th century, but even in Beethoven they're still more NCTS than chord tones - they're right on the borderline there. 11th and 13th chords just don't exist in that style.

So yes, too much emphasis on any NCT could make it sound like a new chord (or extension of the chord)  and that is probably why they typically stayed away from that -because they didn't want to obscure the <b><u>harmony</u></b> too much - just tease us a bit.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Simple answer: Context.

As a sometimes and wannabe Blues player, if the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is F7, and I play a b3 from the key of F, I don't want to call it #9.

In fact, I'm likely to play the regular 9 as well.

I see b3 as a variation of scale degree 3, not 2.

Hence it "should be" called a 3 of some sort.

The problem is, some people (ahem, Jazzers...) want to subsume all melodic tones into chords and call them chord tones and extensions and so on.

And because the naming system for <b><u>harmony</u></b> is tertian-based, and in jazz, extension based, it means the tradition of not having two varitions of the same chord member is upheld.

So you just simply can't have b3 and 3 in the same chord. It HAS to be #9 in their eyes - there's no other way around it. The naming system falls apart and Duke Ellington rolls over in his grave.

Now, I'm being a little snarky here, because it's really about context in some of those cases too.

An "altered dominant" can in fact be a chord whose 9th has been raised (or lowered).

It's not really "because of a b3 in the melody" and they don't always appear on tonic chords. Sometimes they are just stand-alone alterations.

Realistically, if the tune is a Blues tune, and the melody is Eb, and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is C7 it should just say so.

If it says C7#9, someone's being too academic.

IOW, there's a difference between when a <b><u>harmony</u></b> is "resultant" of melodic motion, and when it is a "stand alone" chord. Many people don't feel the need to make that distinction though.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>If I'm even remotely harsh, everyone flies up in arms around here :-)

But you said be harsh, so, I'm not holding back OK ;-)

Those who've seen my other posts may recall that I bring this up over and over again. Now, you're a beginner, so you're not really expected to know this, but this happens so much it's really a kind of funny.

It's so predictable - when I started reading your title that said "my first time ever making any kind of music" the first thing that I said to myself was "I bet it's "YASQ"" - Yet Another String Quartet.

Sure enough...

Ok, look, you can write whatever you want. You've got to learn some way.

And I understand the attraction of the String Quartet.

But you know what - beginners should not be writing for string quartet. You should be dealing with simpler, 2 voice textures, or maybe some music on grand staff or for keyboard. If your instrument if Cello, or Violin, fine, but maybe try writing something for Violin and Cello duet, or for Violin and Piano or something like that.

Just so you know, there's a lot of "baggage" with "THE" String Quartet. It's not only an ensemble, but a type of piece, a form, a genre, and while you don't have to compose the "typical" string quartet, almost always beginners who compose a "String Quartet" are trying to emulate the typical String Quartet (or what they believe it to be) so they're not really trying to create an atypical version - but that's what they end up with.

What this means is, people will think it "sucks", because you've led them to believe it's going to be something they're expecting to be very typical, but it only comes off as a poor facsimile of it, or, just plain "wrong". Then you will get harsh criticism!

Your piece does not suck though. 
_____

String Quartet is Violin, Violin, Viola, Cello. Not the group you have here.

Maybe something that's a little odd is, you're asking the Cello to do all these double stops and even a triple stop - some of which are not practical or impossible.

Cello needs to be playing single notes just like the rest of them at this level. Unless you're a Cellist and can play all these double and triple stops effortlessly at this tempo, they may not be the best idea.

Plus, some of them, like G-D and D-A are open strings which means no vibrato - that forces the player to play them up the fingerboard - not impossible, but maybe not the best idea for your first piece.

Likewise, a triple stop - 3 note chord, can't be played together - you can play G-D and then angle the bow to get the next note - but you can't have all 3 notes bowed unless you can bow hard enough to get the bow hair to flex across all 3, though if the lower string is an open string it can work a little better.

But your chord here is not possible or practical. G-D-A are the open strings, so the top G has to be "negative A string" - putting it on the D string - but then you can't also use the D string for the D note - so you end up with a very awkward fingering up on the neck.

Not that you should use the triple stop, but more likely it would be formed like G-D-B which is a much more common strings voicing.

___ 

From a theory perspective, you've got F#s later in the piece but a lot of Gbs earlier. Those Gbs should be F#s.

The piece is really in E Minor. But you really should have a Key Signature (1 sharp, E Minor or G Major) so you don't have to put it in all the way through.

I know sometimes people start on something, then realize halfway through, "wait, this is actually not in C Major and I'm writing in G Major" and things like that, but that's something you'd want to fix up.

It's hard to comment on your music itself.

Does it "suck"? No.

It doesn't even sound bad! (hey, you said be harsh ;-)

But this kind of goes back to what I was saying about "expectations" and writing "within a style" and doing what's typical. When people write like you're writing here, it seems they're going for a more "typical" kind of writing of a particular style than an "atypical" version.

So my comments are with that in mind OK? If you were going for something else, fine.

Firstly, the opening 3 chords are extremely reminiscent of a very famous Beethoven piece, so a lot of people might think you're making an arrangement of that!


Secondly, you're moving in and out of complete triads and "open 5th" chords - chords with no 3rd.

There's nothing wrong with that, but again, given that we've just been told we're going to be hearing something inspired by Beethoven, the "open" sounding chords are kind of a stark contrast to the full triads.

Like m. 11 is just an "open 5th" sound - D-A-D - and I'm not sure if you know this or not, but the Bass sounds an octave lower than written so your notes are all really far apart. This makes the "open" aspect even more obvious. So, by contrast, you just had all these "thick" chords (even some of the no 3rd ones) because the cello was playing double stops.

Now this chord sounds "stark" and "empty" in comparison. If you wanted that effect, congratulations it worked! But if you didn't, using these "open" harmonies and "spread out" voicings can do that.

m.15 is just D notes and B, so again, you've got all these 3 note triads and now this chord sounds "empty" in comparison.

While I'd still caution you on the Viola double stops as well (even if playable) why not give the Cello a G or some other note so you have a "fuller" sounding chord?

Then when the Viola moves up to D, all you have is Octaves. Very "empty". If that's what you wanted that's OK, but it sounds a little "thin".

At m. 21 things are really nice IMHO! Aside from the triple stop in the Cello, you've got fuller chords, a nice melodic idea, and nice balance. There are things we could say are "wrong" based on Classical ideals of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but you don't have to adhere to all that stuff. Still, if you'd like to learn about it, you need to know that you're doing something that's not typical there (doubled leading tone).

It really stays nice all the way through 34, but then you've got another chord that's D and B. The one right before it is nice, and for me, it's just too much of a contrast going from this really nice "full" and "rich" sounding Em chord to just D and B. Sometimes that can sound like a mistake - like "wait, did someone cut out for a second?"

Your final chord kind of lays out another thing that's happening a bit - usually, in string writing (and in general, 4 part style writing like this) the voices don't have such gaps between them.

A more common thing to do would be to have the Bass on G, the Cello on D, the Viola on B, and the Violin on G. This makes the distance between voices 5ths and 6ths.

Instead, you've got Big space - 8ve, then small space - 3rd, then 6th, then really big space 10th! then 3rd.

Usually chords are spaced in "close" position, where there's 3rds and 4ths between everything, or "open" position, where there's 5ths and 6ths between everything.

Instead, you've got these 8ves and 10ths - which aren't "bad" per se - and octaves are common in certain things - but what it does is make "holes" in the musical texture.

If you want that - again, that's the way to get it - but I'm not getting that that is necessarily what you were going for (though it's more effective in the thing that leads up to the final chord!!! so that's kind of cool).

Also, low 3rds like that in the Cello - low small intervals like that can get muddy really quickly.

The general rule of thumb (really no matter what style it is) is to put larger space towards the bottom and smaller spaces towards the top (outside of for special effects).

So a chord would more likely be voiced from low to high (let's assume a 5 note chord):

G - G - B -D - G  or even G - D - G - B - D

than

G-B-G-D-8va higher B - that's "upside down" so to speak. And makes for a muddy chord.

______

Again, it does not "suck". If this is your first attempt, it's actually quite good. Keep going!!!

One thing that might help is for you to look into some 4 Part Voice-Leading tutorials.

There's a fabulous web series on Classical <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and Counterpoint and Counterpoint in a "Harmonic" setting which is really what more people are interested in than traditional Baroque (or Renaissance) Counterpoint.

I would strongly recommend these videos. They can get you writing music that sounds like music much more quickly than trial and error. Granted, they're really geared most specifically to classical style, but if you learn that as a core, you can branch off from there pretty easily.

Something really important is understanding FORM - and some of the videos discuss Sentence From and Period Form, which are the "smaller" things I'm talking about. And the Counterpoint kind of starts with 2 part.

So think, Violin Melody, with Cello bass line. Or some simple textures like that. Otherwise you just end up kind of shooting in the dark.

I'd recommend you watch these in order starting from the beginning, but here are a few choice ones:

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>A Chord Progression is simply one chord followed by another chord followed by another chord, etc. (we could call it a "succession of chords" as well).

A Chord consists of some number of different notes being played at the same time  (though there's an exception I'll explain).

A C chord would consist of a C, an E, and a G being played at the same time.

That one chord can represent a whole measure a couple of ways.

Firstly, the three notes can just sound for the entire length of the measure.

So if the measure was 2 seconds long, the C, E, and G could just be played and held for 2 seconds - the entire duration.

You could also "re-articulate" the chord by repeating it each beat, which could mean if there were 4 beats in a measure, it would sound (be struck, be strummed, be played) 4 times in 2 seconds (so each sound then would last 1/2 a second).

_______

The exception I mentioned above is that not all of the notes all have to happen simultaneously. For example, if you play C on beat 1, then the E and G on beat 2, they're not so far apart time-wise that we hear them as two different things - we hear them as "one <b><u>harmony</u></b>". We "understand" that a chord like this - called a "broken chord" (ones that happen all togther are "block" chords) represents the full chord spread across - in this case, 2 beats.

This is such a strong factor that we can even spread it out further - like C on beat 1, G on beat 2, E on beat 3, and then the G again on beat 4.

Broken chords like this are called "Arpeggios" or "Arpeggiated Chords" and we still understand that they are a single harmonic unit even though each note happens at it's own time.

I should mention that in actually performance sometimes the first note C would be played and held so that when the E and G come in together, or in arpeggio, you get 2 or 3 notes sounding at the same time - so it might not be a "full chord" on beat 1, but by beat 2 it's a full chord.

______

In composing, this is a way to keep the music from "plodding" or "banging". A Block chord on beat 1 of every measure, or a 4 block chords of the same type per measure, can sometimes sound a little like someone just banging away on the instrument (like piano especially) though they can be played lightly.

But in contrast, arpeggios or block chords add some "change in texture" to the chord and give it both rhythmic shape and some "direction" (like my previous example went low-high-middle-high in terms of the 3 pitches/4 notes).

_________

There is a term we use which is not too technical, called "Harmonic Rhythm" which just simply means how often the chords change. You could think of it as "chord change pacing" or something like that.

You could have a new <b><u>harmony</u></b> (new chord - different set of 3 notes) every measure, every 2 measures, every 4 measures, every beat, every 2 beats, or whatever you want.

We don't say that 4 block chords of the same type is a "chord progression". It's just repeating as individual beats what could have just simply been held through the measure.

So when we're talking "new chords" or new harmonies, or one chord progressing to another, we mean a "different" chord.

So a C <b><u>harmony</u></b> struck 4 times in a measure isn't always represented as:

C-C-C-C - we usually just write it as "C".

So if a song had 1 chord that either repeated, arpeggiated, used broken patterns, or just held for a whole measure, then changed in the next measure, then continued to do this, we'd write it like this:

C - Am - F - G

This is typical of text based notation like you get on the internet and it means that the C chord - however it's played - is "present" for all the beats of a measure (usually 4/4 in most pop music now, but could be other things) then it changes to Am in the next measure and that chord is then present for that whole measure, then same with F, and G.

You don't always have to have constantly different chords either - we'd consider this a Chord Progression:

F - Bb - F - C - F - Bb - F - C.

One exception is, if a <b><u>harmony</u></b> is repeated in a new measure, we still usually list it:

C - C - C - G7 would imply 3 measures of a C <b><u>harmony</u></b> and 1 of G7.
______

Thus, chords can last a beat, or a couple of beats, or a full measure, or a couple of measures (there's one by Wagner where it last like 200 measures or so!). Some songs are only 1 chord, others have many many chords in them. But most use maybe 4 to a dozen on average.

They're just held, broken, or arpeggiated as long as they need to be.

I'm going to link to a famous example, where the notes in the LH piano part are C-E-G, but they're played "Low High Middle High" in a pattern of two notes per beat, so you get 8 of them in the measure. They are not necessarily held (though on piano players can use the pedal so the notes overlap).

The melody in the RH of the piano also happens to be additional C, E and G notes - this doesn't affect anything:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNbqRC4xtEg

Because the high C melody note is held for 2 beats, it gets a chance to sound at the same time as each of the notes in the C-G-E-G left hand pattern. The same thing happens with the E and the G melody notes that are 1 beat each - C-G happens while the E is played (makes C-E-G) and E-G is played while the G is played. Since the C notes is still "in our ears" we kind of still hear it in our mind and assume it to be part of the chord - all of the notes are part of the chord.

So this is an example of one chord in a measure, that uses an arpeggio pattern in the LH (this one is really common and called "Alberti Bass") and just "outlines the chord" - plays the notes of the chord in order - in the RH.

The next measure, the notes change - it turns into G-B-D-F - not all of them happen at once, but those four are all heard as "part of the same chord" - but it only lasts TWO beats rather than the full measure, and it goes back to C-E-G right after that.

Then in the next measure it goes to F-A-C, then back to C-E-G - again, two beats each. So it looks like this:

C - C | G7 - C | F - C | etc.

Usually online, people do something to show when 2 chords happen in a measure, because the "standard" (for a lot of modern pop songs) is 1 chord per measure. There's no standard way to write it, but some people put them in brackets, others just put dashes, etc. So you might see the above like:

C - [G7-C] - [F-C]

or

C - G7-C - F-C

or things like that.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In what style?

Jazz players will tell you it has Tonic function.

In Classical music (at least in the Us) it doesn't have Tonic function.

Why anyone would ever say it has Dominant function is beyond me.

Some say it has "variable" function, which means it varies depending on the context. But that's actually true of all chords.

Others say it has a "mediant" function which is just essentially "leads to pre-dominant".

You should watch this if you're interested in functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> in Common Practice Period music:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LNKDHmI77o
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In a rudimentary sense, yes, it's Pandiatonicism.

However, one might argue that all pop music is pretty Pandiatonic as well...

I think there is kind of a misunderstanding of "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" in cases like this. While it might not be "traditional function", the whole bVI - bVII - I (or i) kind of motion in the 2nd example is a "modern functionality". Or, we can say, a "center" if not a "Tonic" is still pretty well established ("in G", yes?).

So what this (the 2nd example) is is still VERY traidic-based with "added notes".

Usually Pandiatonicism is reserved for when the chord structures themselves are not so triadic/tertian (more quartal and secundal or a mixture of those and tertian) and rather than sus2 and sus4 chords that pass through and around triads or 7th chords, you get more "cluster" chords and "unnamable" structures but still using the diatonic set.

But compared to traditional functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, yes it's not functional. I've heard some of his music that's more quartal based and makes more sense to call Pandiatonic than the 2nd example here (didn't listen to the first since you didn't link to it).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Have you ever heard John Cage's " 4'33" "? If not, give it a listen and tell me if you think counterpoint is useful for a modern composer or not?

I think he wrote whatever came to him. Or, he let the audience hear whatever came to them...

Counterpoint is the backbone of SOME styles. Most of them now "ancient". If you'd like your music to sound like older music that was strongly rooted in counterpoint, then it absolutely makes sense to learn counterpoint well.

If instead, you're interested in working in a newer style (or rather, contemporary style) then Counterpoint may not be as useful to you.

However, I would also add that the PRINCIPLES of counterpoint can still be very useful tools even if the specific practices (such as species counterpoint) that are particular to a style are eschewed.

For example, at it's core, Counterpoint is the combination of lines in a way that maintains the individuality of each line, yet still results in <b><u>harmony</u></b> (traditionally, pleasing <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but that's subjective).

Most of the principles of counterpoint - like an emphasis on contrary motion, rhythmic independence, and so on work in favor of that goal above. Similar motion, in similar rhythm, does not.

So as a **compositional tool** the principles of counterpoint could be very useful for a composer interested in writing anything where independent sounds but still "working together" were desired.

And principles related to counterpoint such as Imitation in it's many forms - Canon, Inversion, Augmentation, Diminution, Retrograde, etc. can still be great tools for the composer's toolkit again even if not a specific archaic style. The principles of imitation are pervasive in many forms of music and broadly applicable.

My recommendation would be to do your coursework, but understand that the principles you learn are learned within the confines of a particular style or with a particular goal in mind. But please "see beyond" the "rule-ness" of species counterpoint studies and embrace the broader applications of what you're learning.


BTW - you need to do what your courses require you, but one of the kind of odd things about Counterpoint is that it's this weird mixture of things that never really actually happened in music. That is, the "species" approach is really a very pedagogical one, but the resulting music is not as "musical" as most people would want it, or, rather, they don't want to write the kind of music it produces.

There are actually two areas of Counterpoint that are studied (or identified) - 16th Century or "Palestrina Style" and 18th Century or "Bach Style" - the former is also Modal counterpoint and the latter Tonal counterpoint. Most people aren't interested in writing Modal music, yet the Species approach (especially from the Fux school) is really "looking backwards". Even Mozart and friends, when using Fux, changed the cadences to be "modern" (contemporaneous) cadences.

Many people are hog wild about it and it's especially good for teaching because there are definitive rules that are easier to grade and give right or wrong answers to.

But so many people want to write more like Mozart or Beethoven that learning even "Bach Style" is a bit out-dated. Again, maybe we shouldn't be composing like Beethoven anymore because it's 2019 and not 1819, but you know, that hasn't stopped a lot of people.

So if you want to know how counterpoint works in the **Classical** era - which leads more directly to Romantic and 20th century ideals than 18th or 16th century styles, I'd recommend you take a look at this video (and really, this guy's whole series):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXXVpYsDdY

Now **DISCLAIMER**, he's sort of inventing his own thing here, borrowing existing terms and notions, but it won't line up exactly with what you're studying especially if it's more traditional Species style (a la Fux). So don't go into your teacher and say "this guy on You Tube says this" (but he is a professor at Eastman...) or "this guy on the theory forum recommends this..."

But what this person is showing you is that there are subtle differences between the approach someone like Mozart would take and say, Palestrina (or Fux) or maybe even Bach would take (he's got a very nice series on theory as well which would probably really help you reinforce topics you're covering in class).

And this is really the first time I've seen anyone do this in a tutorial form so it's a godsend - I'd say groundbreaking in fact.

And why this is important is because if you watch the other videos in the series, you'll see that much "Melody with Accompaniment" music written in the Classical period and beyond is really more of a "Outer Voice Counterpoint, with filler"

Composers certainly wrote more strict forms of counterpoint such as Fugues, but by and large, the Counterpoint of the 18th century style gives way to a different texture that is still "guided by contrapuntal principles" between melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but with more vertical elements (chords) that are not as much individuals voices as before.

A lot of people see the two more as opposites and don't realize how much contrapuntal framework there is in Classical and beyond, but it's actually there.

So it's great to know for analysis, and part-writing, and even if you want to incorporate those ideas into your own music.

Have you ever heard of Picasso the artist? Picasso was really famous in the 20th century for new and daring genres of painting (etc.) and one of his famous developments was "Cubism".

Here is an early Picasso:

https://www.pablo-ruiz-picasso.net/images/works/11.jpg

You can see he had is "counterpoint" down - the foundation of great painting in this style.

But, this:

http://durangoarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pablo-Picasso-Girl-Before-a-Mirror.jpg

not sure if it needed those traditional brushstrokes!

but you can see, if you learn the stuff, you can still move beyond it if you want to - and knowing it well can even help that. But, you can't really just "do your own thing" - you need REFERENCE POINTS to build from - and that's what your course work is doing - it's a laying a foundation - reference points to work from. But to go like the later Picasso (which there's a lot of variety in, not just Cubism), you have to "see beyond" the "rules" of things like Counterpoint and Theory (or "Still Life" or "Landscape") and use the principles applied in broader strokes.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Good job.

It's not uncommon for pieces to have an accompaniment like this that's "the same idea" that just moves to different chords.

But going on for too long with it can get boring. So you probably wouldn't want to go much further with that idea after what you have here, or, you may even want some variation within what you already have.

As already meantioned, the "block chords" in the RH are kind of "beginner-y". Not that that's bad but again it makes for a very specific kind of texture that can wear out its welcome pretty fast.

For something like this, it's probably best if the Cello, when playing melodically as it is here, doesn't go below the piano, so the piano takes over the role of the bass verse.

So the 3rd and 4th measures sound a little unusual. It's not "bad" or "wrong", but it's not something that's typically common in the kind of style you seem to be emulating.

In m.5 a more typical thing to do would be to have the Cello go ahead and jump up the octave on the G, so it just plays the original melody again an octave higher.

But you having done this brings up an interesting idea - what if, the Cello melody skips the G at the beginning and just starts with the Bb on beat 3? Then in m.5 where the low G is now would be a rest, and it would just start on the high Bb - because the way you have m.5 now that's kind of the impression it gives - that the low G seems like a repeat of the melody, but the high Bb makes it sound like a new idea is starting as a pickup. So you might just consider the pickup for both phrases.

One way to sort of "advance" out of this kind of texture (which is viable on its own) is rather than having the Cello be "just melody" and the Piano be "just accompaniment" as it kind of is now, is to have the two interact more - a dialogue where they throw ideas back and forth.

For example, what if, in the piano, either the LH or RH played the same G-Bb-D idea from the beginning (on whatever notes are necessary for the <b><u>harmony</u></b>) in maybe m.3

This also helps to break up what the piano is doing an add some interest beyond the block chords.

Another similar idea would be to take the Half-Quarter-Quarter rhythm and use that in m.4 RH - either as a melodic idea or even in chord inversions or just the rhythm of the RH chord to "echo" the cello's m.2 - and that will help "lead in" to the repeat of the phrase while the melody kind of just stalls on the low G.

BTW, another helpful thing is to add some rests.

Like does that low G in m. 4 really need to be a whole note. It could be 2 or 3 beats instead - that would make the repeat of the idea a little more incisive (and decisive). Of course if you did the "pickup" idea I mentioned above you wouldn't have to do both. But some "breathing room" between phrases is a good thing - since you have "3" things here (Piano LH, RH and cello) you can keep sound going in the piano while the cello rests and vice versa.

The 2nd half of your piece really doesn't have the same kind of room for rests, but it's something to keep in mind as you continue.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It has a couple of different meanings depending on the context.

Tonal Music (or Tonality) can refer to all the music of a particular practice that shares common elements, as opposed to Modal Music (or Modality) for example.

It can also mean music that is "in a Key" or "Key-Based".

It can more strictly mean Key-based music from the Common Practice Period (1650 ish to 1850 ish) and can even be encountered like "Common Practice Period Tonality".

It can also mean for many, just any music that either is similar to tonality in that it's "in a center" - or what many would still say "in a key" but that may not specifically use the CPP elements.

So a lot of people describe modern pop music and Jazz as "tonal".

Some of it is, but much of it is not, or would benefit from a better description, but no such descriptions are standardized. But a lot of modern music is "quasi-tonal" or "tonal descended" or "neo-tonality" and words like that.

u/jeffblinks is really right on - most of what you've heard in your life assuming you listen to US/UK style popular music (like not Raga or something exclusively) and other Western European descended music (Classical, Jazz, Rock, etc.) is "Tonal Music" - at least in the broadest definition.

And that broad definition is "Music that establishes a single note or <b><u>harmony</u></b> as the "center" which we call the Tonic (Tonic Note, or Tonic Chord)."

What differs about stricter definitions is that that Tonic is established through rather specific means, such as functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, cadences, in addition to other factors, while the looser definitions allow for other means to establish the tonal center, such as repetition or a certain exclusive set of notes, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Do you have an example of this problem to share?

Many times, people who do this don't really have a problem and only think they do, but they also may very well have some issues that could easily be fixed.

Without seeing your work, here are the most common issues:

1. You may just have not listened to enough quintets or otherwise aren't familiar enough with them to intuitively understand what typically happens and thus have no frame of reference for reproducing similar ideas. You should find a part in an existing quintet that exhibits the characteristics you want and tear it apart and figure out how to reproduce it.

2. This one's harder to tell based on what you said, but "five part" music actually rarely is in five parts. There may be five voices or instruments, but the texture is actually often just 2, 3, or 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I would suggest looking at some scores and see how it's done. 

3. It also sounds a little like you may be talking "counterpoint" where each part has its own "melody" or "melodic interest" instead of just being there to play a note that the chord needs. There's nothing wrong with the latter and it's a common texture, but, more commonly each part has at least some "interest" that that ranges on the spectrum from "playing chord tones" to "playing an independent melody line" - depends on the desired effect.

Watch the following video, and even though it's synthesized and not actual score, you can see very quickly how the colors work - there are 5 players, but at the beginning, only 4 colors. And it rarely has all 5 colors - it's reserved for specific textures (like around the 1:18 mark). Plus this also gives you a way to visualize which part's doing what since they're color coded.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_MtvEn832A

It's important for wind players (to include brass) to rest. A 5 instruments going all the time just gets tiring on the players, and worse, even more tiring on the listeners.

There are a lot of arrangements out there for these groups, but I would encourage you to look more towards professional published arrangements or actual compositions by respected composers because there are tons of people out there making so-so to even bad arrangements of everything out there for various ensembles and they don't really know what they're doing all the time.

But studying the music of existing composers, and their scores, will teach you a great deal about how to deal with these kinds of ensembles.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No.

They might all play "tutti" which means "all" - which means everyone plays either in unison or in octaves (octaves is more likely because of the ranges of the instruments).

But the Violins typically play something different from the Violas, which is different from the Celli, etc.

IOW, all playing in unison (or octaves) is actually rarer and reserved for special effects/textures

The exceptions are that prior to the 1800s, the Double Basses just read the same music as the Cellos, so they basically played in octaves with them most of the time.

Also, it's not uncommon for the first and second violins to play in unison or octaves - in the case of unisons basically just being like the two sections are just 1 with twice as many violinists.

But most of the time they're playing <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and different rhythms, different parts, and so on.

_____


The sections can play "Divisi" which means half (or some other division) the first violins are playing something different from the other half of the first violins.

So really, it's possible for the 5 string sections (Vn1, Vn2, Va, Vc, and CB) to each play divisi and play a total of 10 different notes (or simultaneous melodies, or whatever). They could even divide up into 3 parts and play as many as 15, but that's comparatively rare.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Playing a Whole Tone scale over a Dominant <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is Jazz. It's a jazz concept. The idea of "playing X scale over Y chord" is a Jazz concept, especially when encountered on the internet. There's only a very small chance it's something else (I'm including "jazzy" approaches in other styles as well).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Chords - at leas the kind we name, consist of 3 or more notes in a special order.

We call a 3 note chord a "triad" especially when it follows this order and has "nameable" - which it will be if you use the notes from the Key to make your chords.

A lot of people don't necessarilay say "triad" and may just say "chord" but when they say chord they often mean a triad specifically - and triad means "chord" - more specifically a 3 note chord (again usually in a specific construction).

That "order" is "every other letter" (or every other note of the key) which is also called "Tertain <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" - tertian meaning "in 3rds".

So we "build" chords by taking a note (the Root) and adding a 3rd above it (which only produces a Dyad, things we don't really have "chord names" for) and then add another 3rd above it, to produce a Root, 3rd, and 5th - 3 notes in a "Tertian stack" that produces a Triad - a chord.

These are the ones you mentioned.

But, you can (and we do) continue to stack 3rds to make other chords.

C-E-G could add the next 3rd, B to the chord - C-E-G-B.

Since it's Root ("1st"), 3rd, 5th, the next stacked note is a 7th (it's 7 letters above the Root as well).

So a "tetrad" (or quartad - both words we rarely use) in a Tertian stack makes a "Seventh Chord".

You can make a 7th chord on every chord of the key.

Cmaj7 - Dm7 - Em7 - Fmaj7 - G7 - Am7 - Bm7b5

You can continue this process to add a 9th, then 11th, then 13th.

All of these chords are possibilities without even using a note outside of the key!

I should mention, 9th and higher chords tend to be more the realm of Jazz, but you will find them in other styles, and 9ths and higher tend to be rare to non-existent (the higher you go) in Classical style music. But 7th chords, while somewhat rare in rock, are still common enough in pop music to warrant knowing them pretty well.

There are a few other ways to build chords that are not Tertian-based but there's really only one we really have a name for and that's a Sixth Chord, which simply adds a 6th above the root instead of a 7th.

Since only a couple of these were common, only two are named with any standard form and that's a Major 6 and a minor 6.

C-E-G-A is C6, and D-F-A-B is Dm6

By a strange quirk of the naming system, the 6 is ALWAYS a MAJOR 6th above the Root note, so E-G-B-C is NOT an Em6 - and that's where the naming system falls apart - it would be called Em(b6).

Don't need to go into too much detail, but suffice it to say there are some 6 chords available in the key as well.

There are also some "modifications" of the Tertian system where a note in the stack is altered by moving it up or down to another note in the key.

sus2 and sus4 chords are a good example. They just take the 3rd of the chord and move it up or down to the number.

C-D-G = Csus2

C-E-G = C

C-F-G = Csus4

We also have "add" chords which are simply tertian stacks that are missing the 7th.

C-E-G-B-D is Cmaj9, but

C-E-G-D is Cadd9

This is all still without going out of the key!

In a way, you could say that any combination of 3 to 7 notes of the key that you can think of will produce some kind of chord or some portion of a chord we could mostly get a name for.

C-D-E-F-G might not be the greatest sounding chord, but we could unravel it and say it's a Cadd9add11 and sometimes people do (sometimes, 2 and 4 are used instead of 9 and 11 to try to imply the voicing, but the system is not really designed to do that).

___________

Fm is obviously not in the key of C Major. So where does it come from?

This is called a "Borrowed Chord" or an example of "Mode Mixture". This is a different use of the word "mode" but it refers to which type of scale you're using - the minor mode or the major mode.

In the Major Mode of C, you can use chords from the Minor Mode of C.

And you can do the opposite.

So all of the chords from C MINOR, are available to use in C Major:

Cm, D^o, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb

and their 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th chord versions (some things, like a sus2 won't change things on some chords).

In classical music, when we change mode, we don't really consider it a "change of key" or a "change of tonality" because the tonal center, or key center, hasn't changed - it's still C. It's just a change of "type" - "mode".

So composers freely used chords from one mode into the other.

Usually we would say though that the borrowed chords are not "diatonic" meaning they are not part of the Key Signature. We don't say an "Eb chord is in the key of C Major". Instead, it's that we kind of think of Eb, or Fm, etc. as being "part of the "C Major/minor local cluster" or something like that.

Plus borrowed chords are going to have an accidental (since the Key Signature of C Minor is 3 flats, Bb, Eb, and Ab, any chord with that note in them is going to have an accidental in the key of C Major - and since all the chords have at least one of those notes in them, there you go!).

So not "diatonic" or "in the key" in that regard, but part of the "Key Complex" if you will.

____________

One thing you should know: In a Minor Key, borrowing the V chord and vii^o (G major and B^o) is so common in traditional minor keys that they are no longer considered "borrowed" but native to the key. In fact they are, in classical music, considered the default state of those chords.

But they're like borrowed chords so based on what I just explained above, are still things you'll see and can use "in a key".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The answer to your question, and those of the other posters who've mentioned it, sounds like a cop out, but the answer is - it's in the music.

&gt;The whole idea of borrowing chords seems lack luster to me.

I'm trying to be helpful, not mean, so please take it in that light, but the way you say this makes it seem like "borrowing chords has luster". IOW, it sounds like you've read somewhere that using borrowed chords makes your music "better" in some way.

Now you've found out the truth. It doesn't necessarily.

&gt;I mean, if you can "borrow" in just about any chord, how does that help you when deciding on which non-diatonic chords might work?

It doesn't. Which is one of the ways theory is DESCRIPTIVE not PRESCRIPTIVE and is not practical in that particular respect. The "right" way to borrow chords is the way you see them used in music - not some description of them.

&gt;I guess it just doesn't explain much as to what the chord is actually doing there.

It's making a sound. That's it. Walk away. Nothing else matters.

&gt;where do sus chords come in? Augmented?

Same answer - maybe not the one you and others may be looking for - but it's in the music.

Learn the intro to Bon Jovi's "Runaway" and you'll see one (of many) ways that Sus chords are used. Learn "No Particular Place to Go" by Chuck Berry or "Oh Darling" by The Beatles and you'll see one (of many) ways that Augmented chords are used.

&gt;I guess I still don't understand WHY it sounds so good

Sorry to say this - again this is an answer that most people don't want to hear - it sounds good because you've already accepted that you like it.

There's nothing inherent about it. All we can do is describe what it is, not why it is. That has to do with conditioning.

It sounds good because you like it.

&gt;play what sounds good. Great! Now how can I go about putting a theoretical framework to non-diatonic yet functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Honestly, by learning how others did it through playing their music.

Very few if any of the people most people admire learned to play music by reading a book, or learning theory. They actually played music with other people. They got on stage and gigged. They played to recordings. THAT is how they got good at what they did. And in some cases, maybe their LACK of theory knowledge brought them to try things they might not otherwise try, only to realize later, "hey, that's X scale" - which means "if I want that sound again, I can think that way again". Steely Dan didn't even know what chord their "Mu Major" was. They just called it what they needed to when they needed to communicate to someone what it was.

Forget the theory. Play the freakin music. Sure, it's cool to learn what things are, but this is a common trap - someone hears HM is used for something so they go overboard learning what it is, how to construct it on every note, how to play it, what the harmonized scale for it is - without ever once finding a piece of music it's used in and learning that music.

Of course I'm not saying knowledge is bad - but it's music - the music comes first. Make music from music, not from theory. Use the theory to communicate about it with other people, but otherwise, look to the actual music.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Trying to help:

"Sleepwalk" by Santo and Johhny:

C - am - **Fm** - G7

This is a "replacement" for a normal IV chord. It's minor iv borrowed into the major key.

"Creep" by Radiohead:

G - B - C - **Cm**

Also a minor iv, but this represents a "modification" of an existing <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

"Peggy Sue" by Buddy Holly - A - F - A

It's just a "color" chord - it's used in contrast to it's sound to the A chord. The rest of the song is I, IV, and V. This F isn't "replacing" some other chord in a functional progression really (though it could have been a V chord for example) nor is it "modifying" any existing chord. It's just there because it has a particular sound he wanted.


"Knock on Wood" - C - Eb - F - G - Bb - G - F - Eb is Penatonic roots (from Cm Pentatonic - not sure if original key as it's been covered by many artists) represents the common pop music "all major chords on diatonic roots" principle which invariably produces some borrowed chords (or other things that are weird). "Proud Mary" by CCR does a similar thing. It's super common. That all stems from a blues influence of using b3 and b7 in an otherwise Major key context.

Now, I know the OP's mention of Ted Greene takes us into Jazz and you may be thinking the same way and honestly, there are additional approaches to Borrowed Chords and Modal Interchange that probably need their own descriptions but the principles here are fairly common. They are my names I just came up with now, not any kind of standard names. But that really doesn't matter. What matters is, I'm taking thing from actual songs and the same idea can be found over and over again in many songs. If that's how everyone uses them, that's probably how you should use them, despite what they're called, no matter what the genre.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I see your points and your frustrations.

I think what you're seeing is that people are trying to tell you that what you're asking has nothing to do with theory :-)

So when you say "It's a theory sub I wish to discuss theory" - OK, let's discuss theory. But "artistic choice" is not really theory - or if it is, someone's just BS ing :-)

Here's a big part of the problem though: Music Theory, as we know it, is about much older styles and doesn't deal with contemporaneous styles very well. The body of work, such as "jazz" has not been studied enough to be able to explain these things in any meaningful way. Likewise, Jazz may not have been consistently practiced long enough for there to be any consistently predictable body of work that behaves in a way that can be described in sort of the blacks and whites that we do with much older styles - that's why we call the older style "Common Practice Period <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" because it was a period when there WAS a common practice.

That's much harder with contemporaneous styles.

In fact, a lot of people are very frustrated that we can't do what you're asking for Bartok and Stravinksy too - because there are no rules - they're constantly changing.

"Theory" for many is a comfort - a security blanket where everything is nice and cut and dry and there are "rules" - I think that's why so many gravitate towards it as a way to make music - a recipe so to speak.

But you see what happens is when something falls outside of the rules - well it's like those robots that self destruct in sci fi shows with "can not compute" - it makes no sense.

And it's hard to accept there are no rules for it because there are rules for everything else.

"Outside" TMK is a term used primarily for melodic playing - improvisation, rather than chords.

The choice of when, and how, to go outside is usually what makes up an individual player's personal style - their own quirks a lot of times. So they may or may not be building on any pre-existent tradition.

To drive this home:

&gt;[re: functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>] and yet there are clear guidelines and explanations as to why it works.

Actually, there aren't. There are guidelines and explanations about HOW it works. But like your sentence before this, it's "you've heard it so you like it". There's nothing inherent about it that makes it "work". Much of the stuff you hear about it is philosophical mumbo jumbo that has been piled on in an attempt to "explain" it - because again, it's really hard to take for many that it's just simply an aesthetic path a culture took.

Maybe the other post I responded to with some examples might help? I know it's not Jazz but at least it's maybe a simplistic set of examples.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>u/MisterRobot0

There have been some great posts.

Firstly, let me say I understand your frustrations. For us in the classical world, the same is true of the "how do I compose like Debussy" (or Stravinsky, etc.) conundrum.

The problem is, there just isn't enough consistency in practice to formulate any "rules" in the way that we have for Common Practice Period music - which we've had centuries to reflect on.

Secondly, CPP music is just that "common practice" - so we can identify these larger strokes and formulate rules. The problem with things like Jazz is, they are continuously evolving and some things, like Chord-Scale theory, are relatively new, so it's harder to define any "common practices" on the same scale.

However, one fortunate thing is that in some ways, Jazz is heavily indebted to CPP ideas so they can still be relevant.

I'm not a jazz guy - but I'll give you a historical perspective and hope that helps.

________

In Classical <b><u>harmony</u></b>, "Mode Mixture" is just that, mixing the two modes, Major and Minor. You can "borrow" chords from minor to use in major and vice versa.

Jazz expands on this, calling it "Modal Interchange" where chords from other modes can be used.

But let's put that aside for a moment.

Traditionally speaking, in a key, and within a harmonic context, various notes have various "tendencies". These are context-dependent but we can state a few general things:

2 tends to resolve to 1 or 3.

4 tends to resolve to 3.

6 tends to resolve to 5.

7 tends to resolve to 1.

Now, mode mixture only affects scale degrees 3, 6, and 7.

3 simply changes the mode from major to minor and vice versa. So that one's easy.

We might say that the remaining two "intensify" their roles (or functions if you like).

Moving 6 closer to 5 (such as b6) makes it more strongly want to resolve to 5.

So a V7b9 has that much more pull to I than a V9 does.

Moving 7 closer to 8 (1) makes it want to resolve that much more strongly to I. A V7 has more tendency to resolve to I than a v7 does.

If I had to break it down into things we could define, I'd say the following:

______

Harmonies borrowed from the parallel key to "intensify" (such a loaded word, but I can't think of anything better - we use it when speaking of secondary dominants so it seems appropriate).

In essence, this means having a <b><u>harmony</u></b> "turn into" or "be replaced by" the same chord from the opposite mode.

V and vii^o are both examples of this in minor (notice they contain raised 7).

iv, V7b9, vii^o7 (fully diminished), ii^o, bVI, etc. are examples of this in minor (notice they all contain b6).

A IV might move to V - well, a iv can move to V too, or a IV can turn into minor iv and then move to V. Same thing can happen as it progresses to I.

Since the b6's tendency once altered is to resolve down to scale degree 5, any chord of resolution is going to have a 5 in it, but typically I or V.

In some ways, you can think of borrowed chords - especially b6, as - oh my god, dare I say it? - "negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>". OK, not to use JC's nomenclature, but it is "anit-function" or "un-function" - I always used to say decades ago that b6 is an "unleading tone" in that it resolves DOWN and to 5, instead of up into 1 like the normal leading tone.

So the principle is somewhat similar to a Secondary Dominant, but it's not leading to the 1 of the chord it's going to, but the 5 of the key in most cases.

_____

Xenoceratops has gone over the distinction which is correct insofar as most musicians and especially classical musicians discuss it.

Secondary Dominants are somewhat similar in concept to Borrowed Chords but we feel they're different enough to warrant a distinction.

______

That said, you can have a Secondary Borrowed chord!

Since you can "intensify" a I chord with a V7b9 (which is borrowed from the parallel minor) you can do the same with a V7/V - it could be a V7b9/V.

Also, in jazz, it's typical to use almost exclusively vii^o7 /X in all cases - which is a borrowed chord when the chord of resolution is Major (IOW, the vii of the key of F is Em7b5, while the one from Fm is E^o 7, so in C, these would be viim7b5/IV or vii^o7 /IV  - but if you're going to a minor chord, it's always o7 - so many people just pick o7 because it works either way).

These are still "replacement of function" though - you're replacing the Dominant function chord that would lead to X with an "intensified" version from the key of "x minor" if you like.

_________

Generally speaking, all of that above happens simply by changing the chord from what it would be, to the borrowed chord version of it.

Progression is ii7 -V9 - I, you make it  ii - V7b9 - I, or iim7b5 - V7b9 - I

____

The other way to use it is with a <b><u>harmony</u></b> that is already stated, then you change it to the borrowed version - again this "intensifies" the chord.

IV - iv - I.

V9 - V7b9 - I

ii7 - iim7b5 - I (or IV - IVm6 - I, etc.

____

So there are some "typical uses".

Modal Interchange is an entirely different subject and it's really 2 things. One is "modal interchange for soloing" in Jazz, and the other is "modal interchange to create modal chords" in jazz and other pop styles.

When someone says "play Lydian over the Tonic chord" that's a totally different thing and it's a shame we call that modal interchange because maybe "mixture" is actually a better word (though already taking with a different meaning). Most of "modal interchange" in this respect is "Bi Modality" - two modes at once - one for the scale for soloing, and one for the chord - which is where we get "Chord-Scale" theory.

Chord-Scale theory is still evolving and really is still much more of a "do what sounds good" kind of premise. And it's not only modes that are used. But playing over an Alt chord generally calls for a Modal Rotation of Harmonic Minor.

This is a totally different concept.

_____

The other part of this is doing things like playing in Dm, but using a G chord consistently.

Is it "mode mixture" - or is it just a mode? It could just be D Dorian. That's not really any of these things - that's jut playing in a Mode.

But, the old type of Mode Mixture isn't really used like this. For example, while raised 6 is used in Minor keys, it's used for a very specific purpose, not just to make a Major IV chord.

So if we have a piece in the key of Dm that goes Dm - Cadd9 - G/B - Bb - the G/B is not really "from melodic minor". It's also not really from the major mode (Mode Mixture). Instead, it's from Dorian Mode (or maybe the piece is Dorian and it's the Bb coming from D Aeolian). We have to use context to determine that one.

That's why when someone below says "the answer could be all of these" that is where it gets confusing - you have to be familiar enough with the music to be able to figure out the context - which in itself can be frustrating.

_______

In closing, I want to say that I think a lot of us - myself included - have tried to find answers to these questions. I remember 25 years ago on a Newsgroup (!) asking about a hierarchy of consonance and dissonance - which intervals were more dissonant, and which ones were more consonant.

Luckily someone came by and said "why does it matter - you'll see both types in music".

And luckily, that resonated with me.

It's fun to geek out on theory. But I think what a lot of us are trying to do is tell you, yeah, we've already been down this path and it's a waste of a lot of time. Not a total waste of course, but you'll get more mileage out of playing and analyzing music.

I hope that helps. This is not something that can really be solved in a single post as the many responses have shown - there are a lot of perspectives on it (and some misinformation on it) but yes, simply put, there hasn't been enough study of, and consistency in the style to be able to make the same kind of sweeping generalizations we do of Common Practice Music. We can only take what we find that is a common practice within the style, and what we can find that builds on pre-exisiting styles and work from there.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Means "every other note".

Whenever you get a set of notes - like four notes - you have to put them in "every other note order" to first determine the Root note.

E-G-A-C - keep re-ordering it until they're every other letter.

A-C-E-G - it's "some type of A chord".

Once you do that, you then have to figure out what kind of A chord it is.

This is called a "Seventh Chord" because the every other letters are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th notes of a scale of some sort.

We call the 1st the "root" but the rest are the numbers they're named for - 3rd, 5th, 7th. We don't call a 3 note chord a "5th" chord as it's assumed.

But for chords that add one or more "every other note" notes to the chord, we call them by their number - 7th chord, 9th chord, 11th chord, and 13th chord.

A 4 note version with every other letter present is a 7th chord.

7th chords are named in two "halves" - what the Triad part of the chord is, and then what the distance of the Root to the 7th is.

Major Triad + Major 7th is a "Maj7" chord. Cmaj7 for example.

Major Triad + Minor 7th is a "7" chord. C7 for example (sometimes people actually say "major minor 7th chord" or put CMm7, or they also call it "Dominant 7th" or put Cdom7 etc.)

Minor Triad + Minor 7th is a "min7" chord. Cmin7 for example (Cm7, C-7, etc.)

Diminished Triad + Minor 7th is a "half diminished7" chord. Cø7 for example (also called Cm7b5).

Diminished Triad + Diminished 7th is a "fully diminished7" chord. C^o7 for example (also Cdim7 or even just C^o or Cdim in Jazz).

Many people often wonder where the name "half diminished" comes from - and why some people say "fully diminished" versus just "diminished" and that's because the two "halves" of the name - either only one half of it has a diminished part - diminished triad in the half diminished 7th chord, or both halves are diminished - diminished triad AND diminished 7th, for "fully" diminished.
_____

So to figure these out, other than being really familiar with them, you have to know your triad types AND how to figure out what the distance between the root and the 7th is.

Now we know A-C-E is a minor triad, and A to G is a minor 7th, so it's a minor 7 chord, or Am7.

In our original, E was the lowest note so we call it Am7/E (or it's an Am7 in second inversion)

_____

Not all 4 note chords (or "n" note chords for that matter) are stackable in 3rds.

Some of them may still be 7th chords though.

For example, if you got a chord with two C notes, an E, and a Bb, there's no way to order those every other letter unless we assume a missing note:

C-E-(G)-Bb

We still name it what it would be if the missing note were present (the two Cs doesn't matter, we throw out duplicates for the purposes of naming). So this would be a C7 chord (Cdom7).

For this reason, it's super important to memorize your "every other letter" sequences:

A-C-E-G, B-D-F-A, C-E-G-A, and so on. It helps you more easily spot missing notes, or reorder them into tertian order.

G-B-C-E  - that's some form of C-E-G-B.

D-F#-C - that's some form of D-F-A-C.

This is something you can practice on your commute, on your lunch break, whenever you have a few minutes.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You "figure out" function by how the chord works in the musical context, not what it is.

Every C chord in a piece in C major is not necessarily functioning as the "tonic" (i.e., has tonic function).

It's the CONTEXT that determines function.

Honestly you really should forget this and just write what sounds good to you.

There's even no law that says you have to write functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> at all. In fact, a great deal of modern music (even in pop music) is "non functional" and to some degree, "anti-functional".

Learn songs - like listen to "Maiden Voyage" that u/Jongtr linked to, and learn them, and take note of what the chords are. Don't spend a ton of time trying to figure out why or how they "work". They work because he used them and we accept that sound as something we like. And that explains one way of how sus chords can be used.

Keep doing this with more music - every time you learn a song and hit a sus chord, take note of how it fits into the song.

After a while you'll start to see common patterns in styles and you'll "get" how they work.

Most people today use them three primary ways:

1. As decorations of triads.

2. As their own stand alone "sound units" that get used for their sound, not any function.

3. in the more traditional resolution sense (which is also somewhat decorative in origin).

After you play a bunch of tunes that do those things you'll pretty much understand how they get used in pieces, and you can use them in similar ways if you like.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Hay, maybe my "YASQ" is catching on ;-)

Cellist will be excited by the amount of whole notes...

There are many nice ideas.

But, for example, around m.10 your inner part just seems like "filler" - it doesn't really seem to have any reason to be there.

It kind of looks like you thought through the melody and bass, but then just threw in different notes in the middle until you got something you liked.

Because of this the intro kind of seems a little aimless. I mean, if your goal is to depict two adults having a conversation and a kid tugging at the pants leg of one of them interrupting and being annoying, it does that pretty well. But otherwise it seems to be "competing against" the other two parts rather than supporting them or joining them.

That seems like the case any time you have this 3 part texture with a few exceptions.

The Andante is nice up to about 26 - it seems like your approach works well with 2 parts, but the 3rd part seems like an "intrusion" and "distraction" rather than playing nice with the others. That's fine if that's what you were going for.

But, for example, at 26, some dynamic distinction between the parts would be important - here, I feel the Viola has the "melody" while the Violin is the nagging part.

The 4 part section from about 31 onwards has a more consistent approach and more "logic" as a whole to the parts. The <b><u>harmony</u></b> is a bit questionable here. It's just really clear "what you're trying to say" with that (or the entire piece in many places).

The next section after that starts to sound like you've got "well, what do I do next, here's another idea" and you kind of glue on this new idea (but you do have elements from previous sections which does help to tie them together) and it seems more like ideas just continually tacked on with no seeming reason for being there other than "I need something else..."

Whose string quartets are you using for a model for writing?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;seems a lot of the information out there focuses on <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody.

Yep. Unfortunately.

I suppose it depends on where you are and what you want or need to learn.

Probably the single biggest problem with Meter is people don't understand the difference between Simple and Compound Meters.

The next biggest misunderstanding I see here is that rhythm does not necessarily affect the meter - people seem to think that syncopation changes the meter - and maybe to say it this way - it's "pulse" that determines meter, not the actual sounds you hear - sometimes they agree, but sometimes they don't. They have to agree enough to give a sense of pulse, but the common 3+3+2 syncopation in 4/4 does not make it 8/8.

It's also hard to say about WRITTEN rhythm - so many people have "natural rhythm" that they don't really pay attention to rhythmic notation and like people who can "play by ear", reading it or writing it isn't even a factor.

_____

I think the rhythm that is discussed is unfortunately a lot like a lot of pitch-based topics - people get all excited by fancy words like syncopation or polyrhythm - or metric modulation - before they even really know how the basics work.

_____

That said, probably after the "basics", the next steps would typically be Asymmetrical Meters (7/8, 5/8, etc.), tuplets and ratios, notational issues (beaming to the beat, rests within beam groups, etc.) and then you get into the more complex things like metric modulation, nested tuplets, irrational meters, etc. But most people don't need that last stuff any more than they might need a thorough understanding of Z-Related sets - and there's a lot to learn between "the basics" and the more advanced topics.

Most of it is going to come from playing experience - or rather, a lot of what people need easily comes from playing experience (assuming reading the notation or at least knowing what values and meters are being played) and that's probably why there aren't as many resources.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yeah, right - in a way, Harmonic Analysis really doesn't tell you anything more than just reading the notes!

Fugues almost HAVE to be analyzed from a contrapuntal standpoint, including all the typical elements of fugal writing - imitiation, Subject, Answer, Tonal versus Real, episodes, middle entries, contrapuntal permutations (inversion, etc.).

Honestly, I think the stuff like the Schenkerian Analysis can come later. If you're not familiar with the elements of fugues, start there.

In fact, in fugal writing, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is kind of consequential - it happens because of the motives, and is not necessarily the kind of driving force it is in a homophonic functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> work of the classical era. So it's often not as big a deal as other elements (though tonal areas, modulations, what keys the subjects and answers enter on, and so on is part of the whole deal).

So maybe dive into what makes a fugue a fugue, and branch out from there.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Here is a pretty straightforward example of 2 part counterpoint:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=632QTuyNIA8

It is one melody set against another, that remain independent, though combine to form <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

It is also "imitative" meaning the 2nd part often comes in in a pattern similar to the 1st part - not a strict Canon (which is very strict imitation) but enough that we call it "imitative polyphony" or "imitative counterpoint".

Bach's 2 Part Inventions are a later example of this same principle (though they tend to be more "note-y").

Sometimes, when you add a 2nd, or 3rd, etc. line, they are less their own melody, or are not as independent from the main melody.

Forms like Bach's 3 Part Sinfonia, and all of his Fugues, are more obviously Contrapuntal.

Something like a Prelude for example can be less obviously contrapuntal (or may not be very contrapuntal at all).

Some forms, like Chorales , which appear in Cantatas, are sort of the grey area in between. They are still marginally 4 independent melodies, but, since the mostly move at the same rhythm, we tend to hear the simultaneous note collections *vertically* as a single unit - a chord. So pieces like this can derived from contrapuntal ideas, but the result is that they are less obviously contrapuntal on the surface, making them harder pieces to "see" counterpoint it.

"One melody" with accompaniment, is called "Homophony".


Counterpoint kind of looks like this:

m-e-l-o-d-y-m-e-l-o-d-y-m-e-l-o-d-y

m-e-l-o-d-y-m-e-l-o-d-y-m-e-l-o-d-y

m-e-l-o-d-y-m-e-l-o-d-y-m-e-l-o-d-y

m-e-l-o-d-y-m-e-l-o-d-y-m-e-l-o-d-y

while Homophony looks like this:

m-e-l-o-d-y

c  c  c  c   c

h  h  h  h  h  

o  o  o  o  o 

r  r  r  r  r  r

d  d  d  d  d

And when counterpoint is homorhythmic, yet still contrapuntally derived, it looks more like:

c - c - c - c -  c

h - h - h - h - h  

o - o - o - o - o 

r - r - r - r - r - r

d - d - d - d - d

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You seem to already know what chords are, and you seem to already know how to identify them (though not completely accurately).

You seem to be pointing out that the way people discuss chords online is fraught with misconception, incomplete information, and so on. That's not untrue.

I can't tell really what it is you're asking, if you're asking anything. Or if you're trying to re-define what a chord is or how chords should or shouldn't analyzed in music.

All I can offer at this point is from what I see here, it seems you are like many, in that you're looking at music from theory, rather than music.

Concepts in music theory and in analysis by and large are designed to  point out something that's going on conceptually in the music.

There are no "chords" on the opening of Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" but it's pretty clear that the notes, even though broken up over time, are meant to imply - and are assumed to imply - a G chord and a D7 chord (or I and V7 should I not have the right key).

I think you are confusing, or not making the connection between, the concept of "chord" and "<b><u>harmony</u></b>". What you're really talking about is "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" on a different conceptual level than "chord".


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Square (and Triangle) have odd numbered partials.

&gt;But where’s the line between our perception of timbre and <b><u>harmony</u></b>?

This is a fascinating question and not one I personally know about many, if any, studies in (I smell a Thesis!).

One difficulty in testing this is that if we add partials one at a time, we still can hear them add in.

So if you test playing the same sound and just increasing the amplitude of 1 partial - you're kind of asking at what threshold will it become audible as its own note rather than a component of timbre.

Can't answer that. It may vary person to person, and it may vary with the overall volume as well. I think there are tons of variables that would affect this so it's hard to get any concrete results. Still it would be a fascinating study.

With metal, things like Tuning forks have to be designed to specific shapes and densities and all that to ring true (of course, that's true for blocks of wood and other things as well). Something like tubes - like they make wind chimes out of - can be tuned pretty easily as they already produce a strong fundamental (and that may be a result of the way the tube is made in the first place). But I'm thinking of something more like a length of rebar, or a wrench - they tend to be all over the place - but people have used stuff like Brake Drums to emulate an Anvil in orchestra/band for years now - but they still produce more of this non-descript "ting" than a specific note - more of an "effect" than playing a scale or something - which we need something more like vibraphone tone bars for - which are more specifically constructed to ring pure.

If you're interested in Synthesis, look into FM Synthesis, because it does in fact tend to do "metallic" sounds more well (Vibes, Haprsichord like string instruments, etc.) whereas additive (and subtractive) synthesis tend to produce those waveforms like in the video better. But that might help you get a handle on the way the different synthesis techniques emulate what happens in the real world.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>All you need is a "Controller Keyboard" which can be plugged into your computer (or phone, or tablet nowadays) and be used to play sounds.

Alternatively, you could get an "arranger keyboard" type instrument like the Yamaha PSR line. Many of these also work as controllers so best of both worlds.

But something simple would be fine - it's primarily so you can HEAR the things that you're working on. You can't play chords on Bassoon (ignoring multiphonics and the like) so being able to sit down at the keyboard and play 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> is helpful.

Another solution would be to use a free program like Musescore that allows you to enter notes on both staves, then play them back so you can hear them. The bonus of this is you could even print something so you can turn it in.

Since it's free, you might want to go ahead and download it now and kind of mess around with it, to get some idea of how it works and  see if you'll be able to use it.

Then, if you still need to get a keyboard instrument of some sort, you can.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Honestly, you need to play some more music.

You can think of a Chord as a bunch of notes happening at the same time, but in music, we understand that if all the notes don't happen at the exact same time they still imply the Chord.

What this means is we don't have to pound away at block chords on every beat all the time - sometimes we do, but other times the chord is "activated" by breaking up the notes rhythmically so they happen in succession. For example, a C chord could be played C-E-G all at once, or it could be a C, followed by an E, followed by a G.

What a composer or songwriter uses depends on the kind of effect they want.

As already pointed out, solo melodies can outline <b><u>harmony</u></b> in such a way as to imply chords, even with non-chordal notes thrown in.

Some patterns in music are so common that we've come to expect two harmonies - like a final cadence - G to C chords - but, because we expect that in the key of C, all that is needed is a G note to a C note and we get that that means "G <b><u>Harmony</u></b> to C <b><u>Harmony</u></b>".

In other similar contexts, where things happen the same way a lot of times, we can have just two note chords and that is enough information to understand the implied <b><u>harmony</u></b> - because we think of it like "what the chord would be if all the notes were present"
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Kind of.

If you're in the key of C, and it's a C chord, and a C melody note, then the next notes are a 3rd above C (E), and then a 3rd above that (G) in the key.

However, things can get funky because the melody note is not always the root of the chord.

For example, if G were the melody note, you could sing a 3rd and maybe even a 5th above it (G-B-D) but if the <b><u>harmony</u></b> below it is a C chord, it may not sound like you want (would give you a Cmaj9 sound, which could be OK).

If melody notes move by quickly enough it doesn't matter if all the notes are parts of the chords or not, as long as enough of them are to make it sound like it's not totally the wrong notes.

So maybe a more accurate way to do it is take the melody note and find out what it is, and then what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is, and how it relates to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - is it the root, 3rd, or 5th? Then the other parts should take which ones it's not typically.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Personally, I think people would do themselves a big favor if they stopped worrying about functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, unless they're specifically studying Common Practice Period music!

In one sense, the purpose of the modes in the way we use them today is to intentionally avoid functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> in favor of a "new functionality" or "substitute functionality" if you have to have any functionality at all.

For example, the Mixolydian v - I can still sound quite "resolved" in a modal context but it is - as you said - exactly the opposite to why V got used in minor to begin with.

Bit of history aside here - it was actually common in pre-tonal Modality to use V instead of v in any key that didn't have one - just like CPP Minor keys. So Dorian, Mixolydian, etc. got a V instead of v. That is one of the very factors that ultimately led to functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the "ubiquitousness" of the V-I progression being one of the "defining" elements of tonality.

But today, one of the reasons people use modes is to NOT have functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> (or again, if there's anything we must call "function" it's a different/modified version).

The problem is, Major and Minor are SO ingrained in our being that sort of the only way to use a mode is to have it decidedly non Tonal - and since functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is part and parcel of Tonality, they want to avoid it like the plague.

So in order for Aeolian to really sound Aeolian, it "must" have v - i, not V - i.

Major is so ingrained in us that even Minor has a tendency to drift towards the relative major without the use of the V (or viio) chord.

But with the way modern modes are used, they too have this danger, but, people don't want to use a "too tonal sounding" V7 - I/i either.

So instead they kind of try to avoid as many tonal trappings as they can - they set up modes by ostinato, drones, clear use of the tones that are not major or minor, modal cadences, etc. - but interestingly, while still treating them "as if they were keys".


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Parallel 3rds is when you have a musical line - say C-D-E and you add a 3rd above each of those notes, so there's another musical line that moves "in parallel" at a distance of a 3rd apart - so E-F-G, like:

E - F - G

C - D - E

You could add the 3rd above or below the main line, and we'd call either parallel 3rds.

They're super common. Also, Parallel 6ths are very common. Parallel 4ths are somewhat common in lead playing. So are parallel 5ths. But those last two are very common in chordal playing - power chords are 5ths, so when you move power chords up and down they are "parallel 5ths".

But we usually don't say that - we reserve "parallel whatevers" for melodies, licks, lead lines, and so on.

One I can think of off the top of my head in parallel 4th IIRC is Aerosmith's "Sweet Emotion" in the interludes between verses. Oh, now I think about it, I think the guitar solo in Rush's "Closer to the Heart" is mostly parallel 5ths.

"Black Dog" by Led Zeppelin has parallel 3rds in the main lick and Boston's "More than a Feeling" is laden with them in those intro lead lines.

The "twin lead guitarist" thing usually uses them a lot and it was common in metal bands in the 80s and beyond - kind of became a signature of bads like Priest, Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Def Leppard:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_X5A-BYjO8

But they actually don't stay 100% parallel all the time - sometimes they change the interval to accommodate the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

It's worth checking out the two parts to see how they interact. Another good one is "The Boys are Back in Town" by Thin Lizzy.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>My guess is you're taking a traditional Common Practice Period theory course (though you used the word "substitution").


You should really watch Seth Monahan's YT series on <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It explains a lot of this.

But, to explain here:

Generally speaking, chords move by ascening root movement of a 4th to get to I.

That means V wants to go to I, ii wants to go to V, vi wants to go to ii and so on.

This is the "circle" progression (I prefer "Cycle of 4ths" because the Circle of 5ths really isn't about chord progressions).

IV, like ii, is a pre-dominant chord and wants to go to V and often does.

vii^o is like V, a dominant chord, and wants to go to I.

So when chords "progress", they move towards the goal of the I chord.

iii - vi - ii - V - I

I can go anywhere.

So typical progressions might be I V I, or I ii V I or I vi ii V I etc.

IV and vii^o fit directly under ii and V respectively, but I'll write it like this:

iii - vi - ii/IV - V/vii^o - I

So vi can go to ii OR IV. IV can go to V or vii^o . ii can go to vii^o (pretty rare though)

Also, IV can "turn into" ii before moving on to V or vii^o. Likewise, vii^o may change to V before moving on to I.

(BTW, vii^o traditionally only appears in first inversion).

Then there are a couple of exceptions:

iii sometimes skips vi and goes directly to IV.

V often goes to vi and vi to V.

Monhan's videos describe IV-I and ii-I as other types of progessions but honestly, most people just say "I can go anywhere" so IV - I is not always seen as a "progression" per se, but just a reinforcement of the key. Because the IV usually moves on to a V or ii-V anyway. I is just "inserted" into the progression - doesn't really affect it though.

Here's a really good chart that shows all this:

https://i.pinimg.com/736x/85/a1/be/85a1bee6d3c79e697e40ec50e7ea7f2e.jpg

I usually just flip ii/IV and V/vii^o so the ii and V are on the top row in line with iii and vi so the Cycle of 4ths just goes across the top. Here it goes across the bottom but same principle.

Minor keys aren't much different than Major, but VII has a special use.

Monahan has his "big 18" which for Classical Period (not necessarily Baroque Chorales if you're learning them) which is cool becuase it's really kind of what actually happens.

To that point, I always joked with my students that they were only allowed to use the iii chord 3 times per semester. 4th time they got an F on the assignment.

iii (in Major keys) is jut not that common a chord in CPP music.

You should probably start at the beginning of this series for the sake of completeness, but his video covers some of these aspects:

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>4'33" of course.

Or, music on a long thin wire.

Though I'd have to say I probably prefer Etude aux Chemins de Fer or I am Sitting in a Room.

But in the realm of music with more notes:

Probably "Low Rider" by War.

There actually aren't very many songs that are one single <b><u>harmony</u></b> throughout - some maybe be borderline - Chain of Fools, Run Through the Jungle, Whole Lotta Love, etc. But there are elements in them that imply additional chords, such as backing vocals singing a bVII chord moving up to i as in Whole Lotta Love, and similar things.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>&gt;So, for years, I have had this idea to merge traditional functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> with the pentatonic scale. 



D-A to G-D to C-E-G.

There. ii - V - I.

Functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

What you're asking deserves a longer explanation than I want to give right now (late and I'm tired) but yes, if you want "Traditional Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" you need to use traditional elements - the elements are inextricably intertwined if you like. That's why, you could have a pentatonic melody over traditional diatonic chords and do it - which is what most people do, but having an exclusively pentatonic note set is going to make it difficult if not impossible aside from the example I gave above - IMPLIED <b><u>harmony</u></b>, not full <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

And therein lies the problem - the whole point of getting into non-traditional scales was, and probably should be - to get away from functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. People writing with those scales used other means to set up a "center". People keep trying to force a horse and a chameleon to mate. I understand why - it's always functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> this and functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> that - but it's not the only way to make music.

This all also depends on how you define "functional" - does it have to be traditional, or can new functionality arise in new styles, or, can each piece live in it's own functional world?

Same deal with "Tonal". In a broad sense "Tonality" (with a capital T) and Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> are like love and marriage and horse and carriage - you can't have one without the other (OK, I know you can but give me the song quote here...). So people sometimes say they're writing "tonal" music but really they're using an even broader definition which is more appropriately described as "centric" music - where a "note" or "harmonic" center is established through means other than traditional functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> - which is highly common.

But Pentatonic scales lend themselves better to things like Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>!

You can only get 3 triads?

Well of course. 

But what about this:

C-E-A, D-G-C, E-A-D, G-C-E, A-D-G - two triads and 3 quartal chords using "every other note".

What if the "new functionality" is D-G-C to G-D-A to C-E-G?

You do that enough in a piece and it will seem inevitable to the listener.

Need sleep. Gotta run.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, what do you play on Violin?

Why not look at some Violin and Piano pieces to see what they do, and model your music after that?

Or Violin Duets?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnrzK6v4AK0

Your 2nd version is extremely extremely "jumpy" and music just isn't written like that outside of a specific effect.

You should never have so many ledger lines!

If you look at the Mozart - does it look like that? It's not a question of well-defined <b><u>harmony</u></b> yet. It's more a question of basic playing - like what typically happens in music - not all that jumping around and huge ranges. Most melodies are stepwise or have leaps of 3rds - and the bigger the leap is, the rarer it is. Melodies rarely (by comparison) leap 6ths or 7ths. More than an 8ve is extremely rare comparatively speaking. Chordal arpeggios for accompaniments are a little different, but you can see even in the Mozart the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is often made by just two notes, while the parts move more stepwise rather than jumping about.


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>A Secondary Dominant is a Dominant chord - often a 7th chord, that "leads to" another chord in the key than the main (primary) Tonic.

For example, in F Major, an A7 chord would lead to Dm. It's as if we're in Dm and it's a V7-i progression, but we're not - we're in F. But it acts like a V7-i in the key of the vi, or V7/vi (five-seven of six) - i/vi (one of six).

We just write it like V7/vi - vi.

So there's another way that a C# might appear - as part of an A or A7 chord that leads to a Dm chord.

In m. 8 you have an A7 chord, but it leads to some kind of odd chord - a Dm7 in third inversion. It's more likely the A in the bass would do to D. Since you've got an F in the melody, you've got a Dm chord then.

You don't usually want a Dm/C there because of the cross relation (meaning C# in the middle of the texture moving to C in the bass).

So that's an example where knowing some more about <b><u>harmony</u></b> and theory can help you make music that sounds more like what most of us would expect. Secondary dominants - that is, chords from outside of the "primary" key, need to resolve logically to the chord in the key they lead to.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>hmmm. Hard to say.

Let's say that "Atonal" can actually cover a broad spectrum.

12 Tone Serial Atonality is not the only kind out there.

Much "process" music is Atonal and I find the "process" appealing.

A lot of "atonal" pieces can just simply be bi-tonal or poly-tonal, or just simply "not have a tonal center in the traditional sense" so things like works in Whole Tone scale I include as "atonal".

I also know that pre-Tonal Modality is "atonal" in the sense that it's "not tonality proper" and I also feel that most contemporary popular music and jazz, as well as centric music is "not tonal" and thus "atonal" as well - but I know most people mean more like "Atonal with a capital A" which includes just Dodecaphonic Serial Atonality, or as stated above, those other "less obviously tonal" things.

FWIW, that means I like atonality like I like tonality - there are some pieces I like and some I don't. I find much classical music to be pretty bad. Same as a lot of rock. I in general don't like jazz, but I do like big band swing. I in general don't like choral music but I enjoy Renaissance vocal music (and not all pieces again).

So I think it's wrong to say someone is "drawn" to that broad a style or approach.

I'm drawn to certain pieces which I find artistic merit in or can appreciate, etc. but not ALL of the music in any one approach just because it's that approach.

FWIW, there are probably 3 things I don't like in music:

1. Overly dense music. Even Bruce Springsteen songs where everyone in the band is going all out all the time (with that stupid bell thing) - it's just too dense and I don't care for it - same with a lot of Romantic era piano compositions.

2. I don't enjoy complexity for complexity's sake, or virtuosity for virtuosity's sake. You can take your Paganini caprices and do whatever with them. I'm glad you can play 2,000 NPS in your jazz improv...now play me a melody...

3. More to the point of atonal music - I don't - and I think a lot of people don't - enjoy "arrhythmic" or "ametric" music - or again for me, densely rhythmic or unnecessarily complex, gratuitous rhythmic shenanigans.

So what I mean there is, Atonality doesn't bother me at all. It's when it's coupled with goofy rhythm that makes it sound "bad" to me. Same with tonal music. You can be in C major all you want but if you've got goofy whacked out rhythm, the piece falls apart.

Even the angularity of serial composition doesn't bother me. It's they rhythm that does.

I'm not saying it has to be "normal" rhythm - but I guess, in the absence of a "process" or harmonic function, or things like that, I want something to hold on to - and rhythm is it - recurring rhythmic motives -

And honestly, I think that's what really turns most people off - I mean it's pretty clear through Jazz that people can "handle" pretty complex harmonies and "outside" notes when they're presented in a pretty consistent rhythmic framework.

But the whole "start, stop, stutter..." kind of rhythm that is also coupled with a lot of atonality is probably more of a challenge to the listener than the <b><u>harmony</u></b> or scales, etc.

So I actually really enjoy the "pitch based" sounds of atonal music - the note combinations - that doesn't bother me and it's actually intriguing in the same way that Modality (pre-Tonal kind) or late Renaissance tuning experiments are.

It sounds cool when done well.

So yeah, it's the interesting pitch combinations that draw me to it.

But the rhythm can turn me away.

Along with those other things I don't care for - and unfortunately, a lot of atonal music is also a little "too academic" which is the whole "complexity for complexity's sake again.

IMO. YMMV.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"Eclecticism".

?

I mean, there's so much going on in so many different directions it's hard to identify any trends - especially when you're living in it and the cream has not risen to the top yet.

If I had to pick any set of things, it would be that contemporary orchestral music for the concert stage (excluding that which hearkens back or is homage, etc.) is primarily interested in "sonic attributes" of timbre and "sound events" (see heavy use of percussion below).

The biggest trend (or at least what many seem excited about) seems to be "haute pop" (my word) - that is, blending of pop genres - especially electronic music - with orchestral instruments - "elevating" what is basically boring pop music by putting it in odd meters, using quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and the like, but it's still essentially "pop driven" or has a "pop sensibility" (not just talking about an orchestra accompanying Guns and Roses or something).

Then there's the whole "fantasy" element - call it "fan art" - and "mashup" approaches to combining "orchestral space cliches" to get something that sounds "space-y" or "elven", or "video game-y" or whatever (see influence of film/game music below).

These are all "new" and wouldn't be within the first half of the 20th century sensibilities
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You've gotten some good answers here.

Some theorists use a term called "Centricity" or "Centric Music" to describe music that has a "center" - an important note or chord that is "promoted" to be more important than the rest of the notes through some musical means.

Both pre-Tonal era Modality (early music) and Tonality could be consider forms of Centric music.

They just use different means to promote their center, and it's why theorists use different words to describe those centers - because they're conceptually different - Final in Modality versus Tonic in Tonality.

The main issue is, the internet is full of people who know nothing. "Musicians" often don't learn anything about music at all. There are tons of "experts" out there free to post stuff, or people who write in such a way as to make them seem experts, or people who just like their flashy videos and thus assume they're experts.

And as always with humans, there are people who care to make distinctions, and those who don't. For whatever reasons.

Most people simply don't understand the difference, nor care, and some that do, don't care to make a distinction.

But this is partly why you get things like "modal music has no chord progressions" - it's because someone somewhere posted a video about using drones to help hear your modes and it goes viral and just gets regurgitated without any thought.

______

Personally, I think most modern music needs a new term.

It's actually using "Compound Tonality" or "A Modo-Tonal Complex". There are words out there like Neo-Tonality, Psuedo-Tonality, Post-Tonal, Extended Tonality, and so on.

Others will disagree with me, but here's my opinion:

Modality (with a capital M) should be used to refer to the system and approach as well as the music exhibiting those characteristics common to the stylistic period we commonly refer to as "Early Music", which includes Renaissance and Medieval music. There may even be dividing lines within that, but keeping it broad for the moment, this is the kind of Modality that uses the 8 Ecclesiastical Modes, has a Final, and concepts like Ambitus, Dominant, etc. that help us to identify the music as modal.

Tonality (with a capital T) is the system and approach used in the Common Practice Era, which is Baroque, Classical, and Romantic Periods, where a "Tonic" is promoted through Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. So again, it refers not only to a System, but an Era as well. "The Tonal Era" if we like.

The big mistake people make today is, look at modern music and go "look, it has notes, it has chords, it has a note/chord that is "more important" than the rest - that's Tonality. No, because Modality exhibits all those same characteristics (once we get to Polyphony).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>
&gt;I never understood the distinction between tonic, pitch center, keynote, final, and first scale degree, either.

Very simply, Tonic is the "center" of a Tonal piece.

"Pitch Center" is a broader term that evokes this idea of "Centricity" - it can be used as a synonym for Tonic, but it could mean and kind of Pitch Center for any reason - thus it could refer to a Final.

"Keynote" is maybe a "junior" term - the kind of stuff piano teachers feed their students. It's generally meant to be synonymous with Tonic.

Final is the "center" (or most important note) in a Modal piece.

1st scale degree of course generally also is synonymous with Tonic or Keynote. But, it could be used generically - the first note of a Whole Tone scale is Scale Degree 1.

______

&gt;A mode is a rotation of a scale.

Only in a Modern context.

"mode" before means like "in the mode of" or "in the manner of" or "type". "Scale" comes from "to scale a wall"  - "to climb", and "modus" from Latin comes from Greek which talks about the "character" of the collection of notes, rather than their arrangement in ascending order (the Greeks actually made "scales" downward!)

That is why we call "Mode Mixture" in Tonality what it is - it's borrowing from the other Mode - the only other Mode - the other "type" of Key - Major or Minor.

So "mode" has a number of meanings.

The concept of the modes being "rotationally related" didn't come along until well into music history, and it's why people "theorized" the existence of Locrian (as it completed the rotational set) but MOST IMPORTATNLY, music wasn't written that way so there was no need to approach it that way.

______

&gt;How is C major not modal? After all, the C major scale is a mode of the D Dorian scale, which you will admit is modal, yes?

How does Sow and Sow not both mean Female Pig? One of them is to plant seeds. 

C Major is a pig. C IONIAN is sowing greatness ;-)

It's a CONCEPTUAL difference, hence a TERMINOLOGICAL difference - again, a distinction some don't care about.

C Ionian and A Aeolian are "modal" (lower case m - because the "modern modes"). But C Major and A Minor are "tonal" (lower case....)

But that distinction is maintained in Renaissance music versus Baroque Music. Aeolian and Minor are not the same thing. Ionian and Major are not the same thing, in the same way that Final and Tonic are not the same thing.

_______

I've seen people say that you can't raise a tone to create a leading tone or lower a tone to avoid outlining a tritone without destroying the delicate pattern of intervals that makes a mode sound modal. This has nothing to do with modal music as actually practiced before the existence of the major/minor key system.

Because they're talking about "modern modality" (which deserves its own name as well). And again, they're blissfully unaware of Modality (upper case...)

But it DOES HAVE something to do with the way much "modern modality" is practiced - it DOES very often avoid the use of altered tones for important reasons.


________

&gt;I've seen people say modal music has to be harmonically static, a groove on one chord or maybe two, or else it will just sound like the relative major.


Well that's an oversimplification, but not completely inaccurate. "modern modal" music may often use static grooves and vamps.

 &gt;Others say that rock/pop is modal not tonal despite its obsession with "chord progressions", because the chords are "nonfunctional". (I've even seen people distinguish Ionian from major!)

As I'm doing here. Yes, I would say that most rock/pop music is not Modal or Tonal (capitals...) but instead some kind of "Modo-Tonal Complex". They're certainly usually Centric, but that centricity is established by means other than Functional Chord progressions (unless we re-define what "functional" is) or elements like Reciting Tones and Amibutus, etc.

Modern music tends to use "Pitch Exclusivity" and "Progression Exclusivity" to hint at a center, then "confirm" that center through means like repetition and "phrasal accent" - meaning how often it happens and where it happens.

Think of it this way: A  i - IV vamp isn't really "Modal". It lacks pretty much all of the stylistic elements of Modality. Modality in fact isn't really about chords at all. It also really isn't "Tonal". It lacks any kind of Cadence, Functional Harmonic motion and again isn't really stylistically like Tonality.

Now, we could stretch either definition. And we do. We call it "modal" because it "uses a mode". We hint that it's "tonal" by saying, "it's in D" or something of that nature (not the best example for that, but that's a common thing with other pieces).

But it's really neither. It's something new. In some ways, calling it "Tonal" is like when my dad picks up a CD and calls it a "Tape".

I bet some people would throw a fit if you told them a CD is a "Tape" and said, "but they both play back music".

Just because a piece has "chords" in it, doesn't make it Tonal. Or Modal. Or Atonal. Or Centric.

Those are conceptual terms used to highlight differences in approach.

______

&gt;But there were V-I and V-i cadences in modal Renaissance music even though chords hadn't been invented yet.

That's not quite accurate.

"<b><u>harmony</u></b>" had been invented. They simply didn't conceptualize them with the same terms we did. Even Rameau, who many [internet experts] credit with "inventing" chords, didn't use the names we do. "Chord of the small fifth". "Chord of the 6th".

But it's beside the point. Yes, V-I and V-i cadences do appear in Modality (M!) and that is in fact part of what moved Modality towards Tonality - why it evolved into Tonality.

And that's exactly why people want to avoid those moves in "modern modality" because we are no SO conditioned with Tonal Thinking (there's a post on the top of the forum about it now) that if they want to write modality they have to go to a more extremely distinct version of modality - like modality before it started to "morph into" tonality. Because at this point, we already have this "modo-tonal" hybrid that people already don't know is not purely tonal, or, don't understand how to conceptualize it as not tonal (this is not a dig at you or anything - this is a widespread notion) so if they do want to write modally, the best advice is to avoid any trappings of tonality (or Tonality) like the plague!

_____

&gt;And it's not because dominant-tonic motion is functional (and dominant-predominant motion is nonfunctional), nor is it because root motion down a 5th is progressive (and root motion up a 5th is retrogressive).

This is a bit of an oversimplification as well.

V7 - I is a Functional Progression. In certain contexts. Not EVERY V-I move even in a Tonal (T) piece is functional.

Functionality has to do with Hierarchical Progression - and there's another word that needs distinction - Root Movement Up a 4th is "Functional" - it "PROGRESSES" towards the Tonic Goal.

In Tonality, the Key is "hinted at" by using chords unique to the key primarily, and progressions unique to the key primarily, and then tropes of harmonic motion that is "understood" as progressing towards the tonic.

For example, while am - em certainly exists within the key of C and alone could point towards C as a possible Key, they do little to functionally move towards that goal. But, Dm to G - it can't exist in quite as many keys. It kind of HAS to be C Major (based on established expectations of the style).

I think, it might really help you to watch Seth Monahan's series on YT. One of his videos talks about "the big 18" which are the primary chords that are used in Tonal music. Because those chords more specifically "point to" a Tonal center. It's the reason why iii is such a rare chord in Major keys - it does little to "clinch" the tonality.

_____

&gt;When I realized this, I was able to stop feeling like a V-I cadence was an arbitrary convention, which was what learning it as a "chord progression" made it seem like. 

Well that's a good thing. That's one of those distinctions. How "voices moving" ultimately morph into this thing we conceptualize as a "chord progression".

But I saw an interesting paper years ago where someone had taken "chord progressions" from like 50 Renaissance examples and 50 Baroque examples.

What he discovered that in Renaissance music there was a much more even distribution of chords moving by 2nd, 3rd, or 4th in either direction - what we'd call progressions and retrogressions (they were termed "ascending" and "descending" progressions). However, in Baroque music, there was a clear preference towards motion up a 2nd, down a 3rd, and up a 4th (the ascending progressions).

Interestingly, most modern music I would bet has a greater trend towards the "descending" progressions (hence ideas like IV/IV - IV - I).

_____

So, "what you hear people say" is not always 100% accurate or  said with the concerns about distinctions that some others may care to maintain.

HTH

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The problem is, Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is greatly misunderstood by most people - it's not simply some chord progressions but it is - as you have discovered, really closely tied to voice leading. It's also really closely tied to a stylistic period in music - common practice period music.

It's not that there are no new chords to find, but rather, the things that were used to define functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> define functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Anything else is something else (we could get into whether it's some sort of "new functionality" or things like that if we wanted).

People may disagree with this "narrower" definition of Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> but you can't really say, "hey look, I invented a new functional chord progression that goes bV - I" or "quartal Bb-F-C to I" or something just because they have stepwise resolutions or otherwise logical voice-leading, etc.. They're just not part of the style that defines what functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>F#m = F# G# A B C# D E (F#)

It is common in minor keys to alter the 7th note in certain contexts, by raising it one half step. Thus E becomes E# (we don't change the letter name so it still stays in the 7th letter position).

F# G# A B C# D E# (F#)

That is called the F# Harmonic Minor scale. The E is changed to E# for harmonic reasons - to make a <b><u>harmony</u></b> change from one type to another - it makes C#m change to C# and makes it lead more strongly to F#m

It doesn't change the key - and from a classical music standpoint it actually makes the key stronger!

It is standard in "traditional minor keys" to do this when approaching the tonic.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The evolution of <b><u>harmony</u></b> in Western European Art music might be seen as a gradual move from linear-based <b><u>harmony</u></b> to vertically-based <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Initially, <b><u>harmony</u></b> was formed as a consequence of melody, to the point where <b><u>harmony</u></b> was primarily just "happenstance" - a result of how the melodic lines interacted.

This is pretty much a continuum, but you may be able to describe some points alont that continuum where there were certain distinctions.

For example, the first polyphony was "consonance based".

By the time you get into the Early Renaissance, you start seeing a "Consonant with Bass based" system where, for example, the Duplum is consonant with the Bass, and the Triplum is consonant with the Bass, but there is no concern whether those two are consonant with each other or not.

As we move into the Baroque era, you start seeing a more even distribution between linear elements and vertical elements, with some types of composition leaning more towards one side or the other (fugues being more linear, preludes being more "chordal") and so on. Of course "Monody" and Figured Bass show this kind of thinking more (ultimately solidified by Rameau's thoughts on the subject).

By the Classical era, the "chordal" thinking  - verticality -  is starting to outweigh the linear. It is of course gradual and again, a continuum, but this is more evident in the abundance of melodies that outline chords, rather than the more linear melodies of counterpoint.

This is where we get functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> - basically at a point where there's this 40/60, 50/50, 60/40 balance between linearity and verticality, though again there are certainly pieces that lean more towards one side than the other.

One of the interesting things about this is that Bach is able to write solo pieces on monophonic instruments that are clearly imply harmonic motion. Likewise, "classical counterpoint" is "chord based" in a way that Bach's fugal counterpoint for example is not.

Basically, during this time, more and more linear dissonances start to "achieve chord status" - so 9-8 suspensions get stretched, and ultimately become "9th chords".

This process continues through the Romantic Period to the point where <b><u>harmony</u></b> is more like 90/10 or 80/20 based on vertical structures - sure, many of them still arise from linear motion, but they are ever gaining more independence as chordal structures.

By the time we get to the late Romantic and into the 20th century, <b><u>harmony</u></b> becomes "about" the chord itself, such that "non-functional" chords can be used at will.

Now, of course, the 30the century goes in many directions but the popular music world becomes highly chordal based - witness the number of "what chord progression..." questions here.

So we've actually come full circle - we've come from <b><u>harmony</u></b> being a result of melodic interaction to melody being a result of chordal movement - we don't "harmonize melodies" but "melodize harmonies" now.

Parallelism in the 20th century brings up an interesting extension, in that the chords have become so music a "single unit" that they can now BE a "chordal melody"

However, Polychords haven't really caught on in any widespread fashion - but if you think that we had a single line, then a 2nd line added to make <b><u>harmony</u></b>, then those harmonies became standalone vertical structures, that then were combined with other standalone vertical structures "as line" - that should be our next evolutionary step :-)

So there's:

Counterpoint

Faux Bourdon

Monody

Parallelism (Constant Structure <b><u>Harmony</u></b> as well)

Polychords

"synthetic" <b><u>harmony</u></b> (such as that which arises from Serialization, or other non-traditional sources, using synthetic scales and so on).

Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b>

Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b> that is not Functional, but Mode-based, scale-based, and so on (this would be our most familiar with popular music - chords still made in 3rds, but use" by sound" rather than by function).

Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> (not in jazz, because that's quartal **voicings** not <b><u>harmony</u></b> per se)

Secundal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>

There are also things that are "within" the systems but are non-functional.

For example, harmonic motion based on SEQUENCE is common in CPP music, but isn't necessarily functional. The "logic" of the Sequence makes "function" unnecessary.

Likewise, ideas like "Descending Chromatic Bass" are also part of that system, but the "logic" of the chromatic descent replaces the need for any "functional" relation. This is true in pop music as in Chromatic Embellishment of a Static <b><u>Harmony</u></b> (CESH, the line cliché, etc.).

Then there are things like Ostinato figures or bass lines, or "stock progressions" that simply exist as tropes - the 12 bar blues for example, or a Renaissance Passamezzo, the Andalusian Cadence, and so on.

When you're dealing with other cultures, you have to consider Western "infection". Originally, AFAIK, no other cultures besides Western Europe developed any kind of (significant) harmonic tradition and it wasn't until the incursion of western ideas of <b><u>harmony</u></b> did those cultures incorporate them into their own music. I've heard Koto recitals that just sound like regular old western music played on Kotos, which is pretty disappointing. Don't get me started on "Malaysian Rap" or whatever :-)


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Different keys do not affect composition. That's the whole point of equal temperament.

My suggestion, as always, is that the solution is in learning more songs. Really, you don't need to learn functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> - no rock guitarists did. You don't need to learn modes. No rock guitarist did.

I mean, they did, but they learned the SOUNDS, from PLAYING MUSIC, not from "theory" - most didn't know theory (and still often don't) other than what theory they intuit by ear.

You're overthinking things. Learn tons of songs. They will teach you what you need to know.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, no one uses a I-IV-V progression.

They use a "blues progression", and most specifically a 12 Bar Blues progression, though 8 Bar, and 16 Bar Blues forms appear also.

There are also a few things like 11.5 or 13 Bar Blues from people who might cut out a few beats or add a few.

There are some 12 Bar Blues structures that never change <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and then there are also "vamp" type progressions (Boogie Chilllen for example).

There are also non 12-bar forms that use I, IV, and V in different orders, such as "Sittin on Top of the World" by the Mississippi Sheiks (see where Alabama Shakes got their name!).

But those are not regionalisms. Those forms are common across blues, and are not specific to either style.

"Scholars disagree as to whether there is a substantial musicological difference between blues that originated in the Mississippi Delta and blues from other parts of the country. The defining characteristics of Delta blues are instrumentation and an emphasis on rhythm and "bottleneck" slide guitar;[citation needed] **the basic harmonic structure is not substantially different from that of blues performed elsewhere.** Delta blues is a style as much as a geographical form: Skip James and Elmore James, who were not born in the Delta, are considered Delta blues musicians. Performers traveled throughout the Mississippi Delta, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Tennessee. Eventually, Delta blues spread out across the country, giving rise to a host of regional variations, including Chicago blues and Detroit blues. "
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Best way to think of modes:

Ionian = Major

Mixolydian = Major with a lowered 7

Lydian = Major with a raised 4

____


Aeolian = Minor

Dorian = Minor with a raised 6

Phrygian = Minor with a lowered 2

Locrian = Minor with a lowered 2 AND lowered 5.

You use them like you would use Keys: You build chords from the notes of the mode, and make melodies from the notes of the mode.

If you want to use C Dorian, then you would use the notes C-D-Eb-F-G-A-Bb for your melodies and to build all your chords from.

You would make your <b><u>harmony</u></b> emphasize the Cm chord as the "home" chord.

Usually, because as you can see each mode differs from either Major or Minor by only one (or in one case two) notes, it is often that note (or chords containing it) that are also incorporated heavily so that it doesn't just sound like major or minor.

For example, if you use C Dorian but rarely or never touch on the A note (raised 6) or never use a chord that contains it, it's not going to sound very Dorian. And since we are SO conditioned to hear things first as Major or Minor, we're going to hear Minor in that case.

Therefore, a C Dorian piece will emphasize C as the "home" chord, but it will also make prominent use of the F chord (which contains the A) and the A chord in the melody.

As a general rule, the diminished chord in the mode is avoided (even if it has the characteristic note) because it can make it sound "too major" or "too minor".

Pieces (or sections of pieces) in Modes often employ simple chord progressions or "vamps". They can also use just a single <b><u>harmony</u></b> or "drone" because a lot of Modal pieces as "all about" the Melody rather than the <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.


______

It's redundant to say "C Minor Dorian" and IMHO even to say a C Dorian piece is "in C Minor" or "In C Minor, Dorian Mode" or anything like that. Dorian implies that it's a "minor family mode" and that it's not just plain old minor, but a mode.

So a piece would be "in C Dorian". Sometimes people say "Dorian on C" but that's kind of an older way of saying it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm so sorry about you mom. Just from this video she seems like such a wonderful person and joyous and full of life.

Chords are:

Intro:

D - Dsus4 (back and forth a couple of times)

Verse:

D - D - A - A - G - G - A  - A - A - A

Chorus:

G - A - D - Bm

G - A - D - Bm

G - G - G - A - A

G - A  - D - Bm

G - A - D - Bm

G - G - G - A - A

Then the song essentially repeats with one slight variation on this verse:

D - D - A - A - G - G - A  - Asu4 - A - A

Then it goes through again, but when she gets to the Verse again:

D - D - A - A - G - G - A  - Asus4 - A - this last chord goes to D to play the intro again.

She makes a few mistakes but it seems pretty clear that this is what she intended.

Some of the chords, she's not playing the "right" bass note but most of us wouldn't want to notate things like G/D - A/E - D - Bm/D and things like that - it's kind of a little too accurate. I think she's for the most part just fingering picking the upper 4 strings so some of the chords are therefore "inverted" some of the time, but the "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" intended is what I put above. So it's kind of simplified to "intended <b><u>harmony</u></b>" rather than specific voicing or inversion on each chord, and not specific about the picking pattern, which she varies slightly throughout.

The guitar is tuned down a while step, so the chords actually SOUND a step lower.

So the SOUND of the chords is:

C - Csus4

C - G - F - G

F - G - C - Am 

etc.

The "shapes" she's playing are forms for D, G, A, and Bm (or a partial version thereof) chords, but because the guitar is tuned down they sound like C, F, G, and Am.

Not sure which version you'd want to write out - I don't think it makes that much difference as people could use a capo to move it to whatever key they wanted if they wanted to sing it, or transpose it, etc.

Peace


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is a common question, along with things like "what key are these chords in".

This is not meant to sound a-hole-y, but here are the chords' functions:

Emaj7 - first chord.

C#7 - second chord.

Cmaj7 - third chord.

Gmaj7 - fourth chord.

I'm deadly serious.

Everyone gets all hung up on "function" - I guess because they hear about it so much.

But here's the thing: Not all music uses functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Not all chord progressions are functional - even ones in functional music aren't always functional!

This goes along with that other question: Not all music is in a key. Not all songs have to have chords be in a single key.

And so on.

u/ILoveKombucha is right on with their post:

&gt;but I think this is a case of the artist choosing chords they like and not having a rationale for them other than that they sound good.

I think people have this "need" to "explain" why writers pick chords, thinking there must be some "logic" behind it all that if they could just learn they'd be able to write similar music.

But it's not really like that. It's based on sound. In fact a lot of times, a lot of these writers haven't even heard of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> - or of they did, don't have a clue how it words, or if they do, might intentionally avoid it!

What you should do is just make a "mental catalogue" of what sounds this chord to that chord make, or this progression makes, and when you want a similar kind of sound, you use those chords or that progression. That's pretty much what goes on when they're writing - messing around with sounds until they find something they like, or remembering something they heard elsewhere and pulling it out of their toolbox to use in a song.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>For me personally, it was about experimentation.

I would do stuff like set myself up with little problems to solve - like, "I'm going to use 6 chords and they're all going to have this one note in them".

And I wouldn't "cheat" and just use 13th chords or something.

I also would do similar things with parallel motion, or movement by half steps.

I'd also do goofy stuff like move the lowest note chromatically, the middle note by M2s, and the upper note by m3:

C - E - G - moves to Db - Gb - Bb

so you might say, big deal, just chords a tritone apart.

True.

But:

Db - Gb - Bb  to D - Ab - Db becomes the next chord if you keep the pattern.

So you can create some movements like that that have an "inner logic" beyond any typical progression.

It could be interesting for you to investigate Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> (not just Quartal **Voicings** which is what you'll find in most websites and jazz-related stuff - but that's useful too).

Look up the "Omnibus Progression". That should keep you busy for a while ;-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK. 2 things:

Historically speaking, the Harmonic Minor Scale isn't a "true" scale.

However, that hasn't stopped people from treating it like a true scale today - some are misguided because they don't understand the traditional use, others are using it purely for the sound it creates.

_____

Traditionally, there is this thing called a Minor Key.

Minor Keys have 7 diatonic notes that agree with the key signature.

However, in actual musical practice the 6th and 7th notes of the scale are frequently changed for different reasons.

_____


Here's the issue:

If you make a progression in Am like Am - G - C - the G to C is VII - III, but it sounds just like V-I in the relative major key of C.

Great, but we don't want that sound - we want it to sound like A Minor.

So what composers did was borrow an idea from Major Keys - which was this *major* V chord because it contains the Leading Tone, which is the 7th note of the scale 1 half step below the Tonic note (B leading to C in our example).

And this is why the progression G - C in the key of Am could be so "dangerous to the tonality" because it leads your ear strongly to C rather than to Am like we want.

So composers started altering the 7th note of Minor keys too, so that there would be this "Leading Tone" - which changes a **<b><u>harmony</u></b>**. It changes the diatonic v chord (minor v) into V (major V) and it now has the leading tone. This makes the normal Em chord in Am into an E chord instead, which leads more strongly into Am and keeps our ears oriented to that key center.

Thus, they change the 7th scale degree for a **Harmonic Reason**.

______


Sometimes, this raised 7th was also used in melodic patterns and jumping from the diatonic 6th to the 7th was a bit clunky sounding - hard to sing, hard to intonate, etc. So they made another adjusment, which was, when raised 7 was used, if 6 was moving to or from it, they would use raised 6 as well.

So they changed it for a **Melodic Reason**.

_______

"Harmonic Minor" scale, and "Melodic Minor" scale reflect these two **concepts**.

But they weren't really meant to be scales in and of themselves. In fact, most composers didn't think in terms of scales so much as they did KEY.

Bach, for example, didn't sit down and go, "I think I'll write in Harmonic Minor today". No. Instead, he would sit down and say "I'm going to write in a Minor Key today". And then he would adjust the 7th and 6th and 7th scale degrees as necessary for Harmonic or Melodic purposes.

_____

But today, enough people have used these scales "wrong" to make them "right" in the way that they use them.

So it's a valid approach, but not really the reason behind what you're hearing. Instead, think of it like this: In a Minor Key, replace v with V and VII with vii^o. That would be E and G#^o in the key of Am. These will both "lead to" the tonic (Am) more strongly and at the same time negate the key's tendency to drift towards the relative major.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>That could simply be that you're just not used to hearing those inversions - many of us learn with root position chords and after a while they seem kind of "boring".

I've graded many a student paper where, once you allow 2nd inversion triads, every freaking chord they write is 2nd inversion, and music just doesn't work like that (well, it could, but not historically).

Inversions are, in some ways, just different colors of the same <b><u>harmony</u></b>, in the same way open versus closed voicings are (there's also many a guitarist who will "discover" open voicings and fall in love with those sounds too, because again they're new and fresh and not so worn out as the close position "block chords").

They have been used in specific ways traditionally (voice-leading, bass note variation, different color, etc.) but they can really just be used today as a "different sound".

Try this - play a harmonic on the 12th fret A string (A), the 11th fret (not harmonic) of the 4th string (C#) and the high E open (E).

You'll have an A chord that has a very nice resonance and interesting sound. But it's just A-C#-E. Root position, close voicing. But the timbral differences (which is where the overtones actually are important) make it sound "fresh" most likely.

Cheers
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Firstly, I would say, functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is the idea that every chord in a KEY has a certain function.

However, I suppose this all depends on who you ask and how strict one wants to be with the definition.

I would argue that in Tonal Music, there are Functional Roles that are hierarchical and that certain chords fulfill based on context.

For example, not every V chord is fulfilling a Dominant role, and it's not only a V chord that can fulfill a Dominant role.

So rather than thinking of chords as having functions, I tend to think that functions have chords, if that makes sense.

____

I do fill that those Functional Roles can be fulfilled by chords other than the "typical" ones and if one allows oneself to stretch the definition beyond a strictly Tonal style (or expanding that definition as well) then certainly a v (minor v) or a bVII or even bIII can be "Dominant Function" in that it "sets up the Tonic".

A Tritone Sub would fall under that category IMHO.

Functions such as Pre-Dominiant can be filled by IV in Major, and iv in Minor, but a borrowed chord just maintains that function, so a iv in Major could still be a Pre-Dominant chord. By extension, a modal major IV chord (a la Dorian) could maintain that same PD function in an otherwise minor context as well. iim7b5 as a PD can happen in Major just as it does minor.

____

As an interesting aside, there are people who would argue that v-I can't be because the v is not a "dominant" chord because it lacks a leading tone. But there are also people who feel that bVI - bVII - I represent a sort of "substituted" PD-D-T progression.

I really kind of wish we might come up with a "new functionality" that has it's own set of terms that would disassociate itself with classical functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and tonality (as well as some new definition of centrality that disassociates traditional tonality) so we can talk about the things that happen in popular music that seem like "inevitable" progressions and resolutions but get rid of the "dominant tonic" baggage.

_____

I also wish people weren't so hung up on "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>". It's nice to understand it for classical music, but it's absent from most modern popular music, and IMHO, even much of what people think is functional isn't, and deserves to be defined and conceptualized differently. It's similar, but not the same thing. But people get so hung up on it and there's no need to.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I understand. I was the same way. I want to caution you. You are going to get a bunch of responses about the Harmonic Series and it's going to sound very scientific and make you think it "must" be that way because it makes such obvious sense, but it's actually not the real reason we use what we use. In fact, we use what we use in SPITE of that in many cases.

I suppose I was a little luckier when I was young because we didn't have the internet and I just had to be satisfied  not having the answers - and I know how frustrating that can be for people like you and me - but, what it did was allow me to concentrate on **learning to play music on guitar** rather than worrying about "why did DaVinci paint this tree green" kind of questions.

The real answer to your question - as unsatisfying as I know it seems - is simply that music evolved that way.

The reason scales are formed like they are is because they evolved that way. There were notes, and people kept messing with notes over history - way back from Ancient Greece as far as we know - but probably earlier, we just don't have written records. At some points in history, they liked a certain group of scales, at another, they got tired of those old ones and started using some new ones, then people got tired of those, and started using some new ones (some of which were the older ones that got re-discovered!). What we use now - the Major/Minor system, is one evolutionary branch where two primary concepts, Major and Minor, which are represented by Scales, became the preferred method of making music, and we still use those principles today (along with many others).

But it's like asking "why do we say an adjective before a noun, like "the red car" rather than "the car red" - because that's the way it evolved, and we're still doing it. We don't use Thee and Thou and all that, but we still write mostly similar to the people writing in the 1700s. Music is the same way in many respects.

________

You didn't ask HOW scales are formed, so I assume you understand that.

You did ask about chords, and that's a little more concrete. Again the "why" is a more complex question and again the answer is really evolution.

But let's stick to the concrete:

"Triads" are simply chords of 3 different notes. We typically use the term specifically to mean the kind of chord that evolved in Western European Art Music that you're probably familiar with - Major and Minor chords, as well as Diminished and Augmented chords. A "Major Chord" and a "Major Triad" mean exactly the same thing.

4 note chords are "quartads" or "tetrads" but we usually don't call them that. We call them "Seventh Chords" instead.

The system that evolved is called "Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" and tertian means "3rd" or we can say "every other note".

In this system, we simply take every other note of a scale - A-C-E, or B-D-F, or C-E-G, etc. to make chords. If we use 3 every other notes it's a Triad, and if we use 4 every other notes it's a 7th chord.

A-C-E is a triad, some sort of chord (with no other name qualification) and A-C-E-G is a "tetrad", some type of 7th chord.

So "chord" could mean any old chord, but when we talk about 7th chords, we may use the word "triad" to specifically tell people, "oh that's a 3 note chord and not a 7th chord".

But if you say "C Major Chord" it's assumed it's a triad. "C7" or "a C7 chord" is a "seventh chord".

So you might say that "triad" refers to a specific type of chord, one with only 3 notes in tertian order.

The word can be used more broadly to refer to any 3 note chord - C-F-Bb could be a "triad" as could C-E-B, but we don't usually use the term like that - we tend to use it specifically for Major, Minor, Augmented, and Diminished chords - which are all 3 note every other letter type chords.

_____

Key is a little trickier and hard to explain.

A Key is more a "concept". Think of what a "Language" is. That's kind of what a Key is.

A "Scale" is sort of like the Alphabet, while a "Key" is like the Language - the Language uses the letters of the alphabet, but in many different ways to form many different words (chords if you like). But obviously we can string together letters and words and they can have MEANING beyond what's present in the letters and words themselves.

So a Key is a "collection" of ideas. We could say it consists of 7 notes, of which one is considered the most important note (called the Tonic). The Scale is a "listing" of those notes in alphabetical order, starting on the most important note.

Generally speaking, while "words or letters from foreign alphabets" are allowed in a Key (i.e. we can use notes out of the key), we stick primarily to the notes of the Key to make our chords from.

What this means is, in the Key of C Major, the scale will be C-D-E-F-G-A-B - all 7 notes starting on the "important" one (but this just for a concept, not necessarily the way you have to play it) and all of the melodies and chords will be derived from those notes.

Again you can have "foreign" notes and chords (that's actually what we call them too) but as long as the emphasis is on the primary 7 notes, and especially focus on the Tonic note, that orients our ears to hearing the music as being "in that key".

So for example, a piece "in the key of E Major" will have the notes from that key, plus there will be musical emphasis on the E chord and notes of the E chord in the melody.

Think of it like a story about Fred. You're probably going to mention Fred a lot. He's the "Tonic". And all the other words kind of support Fred or help us understand what Fred is doing or that he is important.

______

I'm going to give you this advice:

The things you REALLY need to learn are:

1. Technical Proficiency on your instrument - ability to play it well - strumming, picking, fretting notes, forming chords.

2. Musical Proficiency on your instrument - ability to play music on the instrument well - play it in time, play confidently and expressively.

3. Music Fundamental Proficiency - ability to know your Notes, your Scales, and your Chords on your instrument, as well as "in theory" (on paper, or in your head, ability to conceptualize them, etc.). It's also important to learn your Key Signatures and to understand Key Signatures, and Time Signatures and Rhythm.

4. That is the "core" you need to get down and build on. Most of the rest is distractions from playing.  You'll hear about modes. You need to learn Major and Minor scales and Key Signatures first and have a strong grasp on those.

5. For that reason (among many other distractions) it would really be helpful if you're serious about learning to make music on guitar, to get a qualified music teacher who can teach you music. Generally we learn music theory along with learning to play, and if you take lessons you will get the information as you need it and can use it - and most importantly, it sticks with you better if you can use it! Music theory in a vacuum isn't very useful at all. I know it sucks and it's great that people are hungry for knowledge, but we've all seen too many people knock around on guitar and get distracted by wild goose chases and never learn to play. I mean, you can do what floats your boat, but I know from experience that many people I've met over the years regret that they spent too much time on frivolous pursuits and should have spent more time on learning to play music on the instrument. A good teacher and regular lessons will make you grow light years as a guitarist, where playing around on the internet trying to get information as you can  will only serve to confuse you, frustrate you, lead you astray, teach you wrong that you'll have to unlearn later, or just make you give up altogether.

6. If you get lessons, you should learn to read music. Real music, not tablature (but you should learn to read tablature and chord diagrams as well). If you don't get lessons, you should still learn to read music. It's basically like being able to speak a language, but not being able to read. It restricts you.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Because we use Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, which uses "every other note" or "every other letter" when building chords.

1-3-5-7- then 9-11-13 - that's all 7 notes of your scale.

It also evolves from the earlier 9-8 suspension in classical music. There was no "2-1" suspension (there was a 2-3 suspension but it was a special type).

As later Romantic period composers starting using the 9th less as a suspension and more of a chord tone in it's own right, composers also started "stacking up" chords in 3rds to produce things beyond the 9th - 11th and 13th chords- Sometimes referred to as "tall chords" because they stood so tall on the score.

_________

Let me ask you this: If you see a chord symbol that says "C", where do you put the E and G?

C-E-G, or C-G-E, or C-E-G-C-E-G, or C-C-G-E?

Chord symbols were not intended to show voicing, only "the name of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>".

So "9" doesn't (and shouldn't) imply where the 9th goes in the structure.

Higher extensions were just traditionally voiced higher in the chord - so 9ths were generally a 9th above the root or octaves higher.

But C-D-E-G-Bb would still be a C9, not C7(add2) (or C2 or something crazy like that!).

_____

That said, it became common in pop music because of the prevalence of sus2 and sus4 chords to call 9ths and 11ths when they are added "add2" and "add4" rather than "add9" and "add11" as it's done more in Jazz (Jazz players tend to still approach it more 1-3-5-7-9-11-13 because those chords are so common, whereas in pop you don't play so many 9th, 11th, or 13th chords - heck, I can go for days without playing a major 7th in some rock styles!)

Unfortunately this leads to people trying to show voicing again but it's not the case.

C(add2) could be C-G-D-E - so the D is definitely a 9th above the bass, but it's called "add2" because it's a pop guitar chord (a common one). C(add9) is not at all wrong, but what **shouldn't* happen is C-D-G-D-E be called C(add2) while C-G-D-E is called C(add9).

That's not what the symbols were really designed for - again, "C7" or "C" doesn't mean that the notes have to go 1-3-5-7 or 1-3-5 and C9 or C(add2) doesn't (or shouldn't) mean the notes have to go 1-3-5-7-9 or 1-2-3-5.

_____

If you want to make like simple, 2 = 9, 4 = 11, and 6 = 13.

However, the 6 was added to chords long before the 2 and 4 and these were very common at the advent of Jazz so they just got a basic name - C6 or Cm6.

C-E-G-A, or C-Eb-G-A (it's always assumed to be a major 6th from the root - again that's the way it evolved).

Traditionally, 9, 11, ad 13 were so-named because they were added "on to" a 7th chord, so the 7th was present.

So a 6th - which is below a 7th, is not a 13th and a 13th chord had to have a 7th.

C-E-G-A is C7, but C-E-G-Bb-A is C 13 (again though, the chords don't necessarily have to be voiced in that order).

What happened was, pop voicings kind of started being used in jazz too, so we started seeing more of these 9 and 11 notes WITHOUT THE 7th.

So they call these "add".

C-E-G-D = add9, while C-E-G-Bb-D = C9

Same with 11.

But since an "add 13" would be the same as the 6th without the 7th, that was already covered by the existing "6" chord.

So there's no such thing as an "add 13" becuase it's just 6 - C-E-G- (no Bb) - A - well that's C-E-G-A - or C6 (and again the octave of the A doesn't matter).


"add2" and "add4" are the same as "add9" and "add11", but there's no such thing as "sus9" etc. There's only "sus2" and "sus4".

I'd just say Jazz players prefer 9 and 11, while pop players generally like 2 and 4 for their "add" chords but you still see 9 and 11 for them, and some jazz charts will have an add4 or add2 in a context where it makes sense.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Listen to actual Asian music.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> is an invention of Western Europe and the reason that stuff is a "parody" is because it's all a "westerner's view" of what Asian music sounded like rather than actual Asian music. The classic "pentatonic melody" and, "in parallel 4ths/5ths" is a general cliche. The Vapors used the same kind of idea in "Turning Japanese". I watch a lot of old 60s TV shows like The Saint or The Avengers or Danger Man and any time there's any kind of oriental scene, pow, there you go - pentatonic melodies and open 5ths.

I've heard modern Koto ensembles and the music disappointingly just sounds like Western Music played on Koto, rather than anything that seems "authentic" to me.

If you want authentic - go to the source - even if it's a "corrupted" version of it. But you might want to go earlier or more traditional to get a "truer" sound.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;  For example if its augmented, you would double the 5th. 

Traditionally, you don't double altered tones. You don't double "active" tones, so not the Leading Tone, not the 7th, not other dissonances that resolve, and not chromatically altered tones.

Besides your notation being kind of messy, you've got 5 and 6 part chords in there. That's not 4 part writing.

&gt;During the 2nd chord (Eb7#5) I am trying to write a 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> with the 2nd highest of 4 voices singing B down to G, down to Eb up to G up to B

It doesn't really work like this. Firstly you have Ab9sus4, and that has a Gb, not a G in it, so your 2nd voice can't go B to G.

Db - Db (sus4)

B - Bb (9th)

G - Gb (7th)

Eb - Ab or C if Ab is in a bass part.

The whole point of voice-leading in 4 part writing is to make connections as **smooth** as possible - if you can keep a note, you generally do. Otherwise, you move the smallest direction you can. You can't really do it with a voice jumping down and up like that. It forces all the other voices to jump as well to fill out the chord tones.

This is made way more difficult by the fact you're trying to use all these 9sus4 chords and what not. It's not designed for that - those chords have more than 4 notes. If you want a 9sus4, you have to have at least the 7th, 9th, and 4th. That means they're going to have to move specific ways to get there.





</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It means you play a Cmaj7 chord, or "<b><u>harmony</u></b>".

If you have a melody note, say, E, and then above the music there's a symbol that says "Cmaj7", that means you (or whoever can do it) are to play notes along with that E that will produce a Cmaj7 chord.

For example, me as a Guitarist, if I was accompanying a singer, the singer would be singing the E, and I would play all the notes that make up a Cmaj7 chord on my guitar.

So it's for the "accompanist" the person who is accompanying the melody who can play chords - like a Guitar, or Piano, etc.

____

As Jon says, it could be that the symbols are just there to show what the already written notes produce - so someone else who doesn't read piano music (such as a guitarist, who often notoriously can't read standard notation), or it could be for analysis, and so on.

Learning how to make a Cmaj7 chord is another can of worms!


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The first two are OK as is - though the 16th note chord needs to have a 16th rest after it.

I can't see all of what comes on the third beat in the image but more likely than not, that half rest should not be there.

In the middle image, the 16th note is actually present, so the first beat is correct.

The 2nd beat should have the tie curved down on the B but is otherwise correct.

BUT, that quarter rest shouldn't be there. It should be 8th note chord, 8th rest, another 8th rest, then the 2 sixteenths to show the beat.

____

You may be being a little too literal with your arpeggios, but, if the upper notes are truly melodic notes, then they should go in the top layer.

It would be a good idea to look at some published Classical Guitar music to see how this stuff is dealt with.

Usually, it's assumed when the chord is arpeggiated, that each note is sustained for the full length of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, even if not written that way. But because in some cases it might not be clear with your chords - for example, the one with B-C in the middle image might look like it's not to be taken on two separate strings if written without the tie as you have it.

But the first two beats in both the first image and second image are clear (except for the missing 16th rests) and the last image is correct (except for the note collision)

The last image is correct as well. Though the F 8th note should go to the right of the half note E


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I've not heard Klaatu, but The Beatles are definitely a band that really was the sum of all parts - the distinct personalities and playing styles.

Now, caveat there - of course there were "Beatles songs" and then there were "Lennon songs" and "McCartney songs" and "Harrison songs" and those each had they're own unique style.

So it depends on what era you're talking about, and whether it's more of an individual's song or the groups. Probably, Revolver and Rubber Soul (but I'd include Help and Hard Day's Night) mark the point where they are still "a band" and the "most Beatle-y" they were in that form (as the earliest music is not as different from that of early Stones and Who, and Kinks, and Animals, and Gerry and The Pacemakers, Freddie and the Dreamers, etc.)

One of the primary standouts to me are the vocals - in fact I just heard "If I Fell" today and they're in <b><u>harmony</u></b>, then John jumps up to follow Paul in unison, then jumps down again at the end of the phrase. Then in the Bridge John is often on a static note while Paul goes above - and they're fairly far apart.

But this vocal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and vocal interplay is very important - think about "Nowhere Man" with it's parallel 3 part chords, versus something like "Taxman" with the wider spread, and then "Norwegian Wood" with the parallel duet ('she asked me to sit'). The other facet of this is the backing parts like in "In My Life", where vocals are doubled in <b><u>harmony</u></b>, then followed "oohs". When you look at something like "Help" with the "echo" backing vocals in the verse, then you've got pretty much all the stuff they typically do (contrast this with "Blackbird" which is essentially a Paul solo song, and he doubles his voice in unison and IIRC there's no other harmonies or other members singing at all).

Musically speaking, unique chord progressions are the order of the day.

I was just messing with "I Want You" the other day - the intro is Dm - Dm/F - E7b9 - Bb7 (!) A7(b13). All of the chords keep the F note on top. And what's interesting is the move from C to B to Bb to get to the Bb chord - we could call all this a V/V going to Neapolitan, which also goes to V (or a TTsub for E leading to the A) but it's just all a little "weird".

Then I was messing with "Sun King":

E - F#m - G#m7 (or E6?) - E6

C (!) - Cmaj7 - Gm - A7

C - Cmaj - C7 - F

Some of those are just weird. It's even the same with stuff like "Day Tripper" where it starts of with what is basically a "blues progression" and a lick, then it moves to F#7 - A7 - G#7 - C#7 - B7

Just kind of unusual moves.

That alone won't do it, but there are comparatively few songs (again, maybe more of the earlier "rock and roll" might not, but even some early songs do) that don't have some "unusual" chord changes so I'd have to say that's a hallmark of their compositional style.

One thing a lot of people don't know - The Beatles had a great way of making transitions from one section to the next - I'll have to ponder some of the tunes I'm thinking of but I'm not just talking stark moves like in the Polythene Pam medley, but more how one section sort of becomes the next or just "falls right into" the next section in their middle period stuff.

Besides maybe doing some little meter things like a 2/4 measure or shortened or lengthened phrase, they also did some neat things like like the "fussing and fighting my friends" in "We Can Work it Out" where, IIRC they use quarter note triplets in relation to the previous measure length, so it comes out like they went to 3/4 but the measure length is the same - they did this a couple of times IIRC.

Also a STRONG sense of melody - especially from Paul. If you don't have this, don't even try :-) While there are songs like "I am the Walrus" where John pretty much sings monotone for  a lot of the phrase, if you compare this with something like "I Will" from the White Album - Paul's vocal melody is all over the place - but very melodic and tuneful.

My personal belief is that, besides riding on the coat-tails of their fame, the reason so many Jazz artists did instrumental versions of Beatles tunes where because there was such strong melody.

Honestly, most people don't even come close (and this is one of the reasons it bothers me so much that people on this forum are so all about chord progression and just seem to be totally ignoring melody).

From a playing standpoint, the two guitar interplay is important, and the 12 string plays a prominent role especially in the earlier albums - but it does give it "that sound". Then of course the use of Piano pretty consistently, or if not, Harpsichord, or sometimes Electric Piano (and then all the later stuff like Mellotron but that starts to go beyond the "core" of at least that central style).

But Paul again is the musician's musician in the group - he plays bass like he sings - extremely melodically. In fact, way underrated as a bass player. He is all over a lot of the songs. It provides harmonic foundation, melodic motion, and rhythmic force all at the same time. Think about how the bass moves at the end of the vocal phrase in "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds". "Penny Lane" - he's all over the place - tuned down IIRC.

Of course it turned out that Paul also played much of the Guitar, Drums, and Keys on a lot of the songs as well, but really what's individualistic is his bass playing.

And finally, a sense of humor. A sense of "not taking yourselves too seriously". Sarcasm, sardonic wit, not afraid to goofy, not afraid to do a cover, etc.

HTH 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I would disagree with walnut881 - classical music of the 20th century is full of pieces that are composed with a specific scale, even non-traditional ones such as Whole Tone scales.

However OP, many scales, like Hirajoshi, can't produce traditional chords so your composition approach can't be the same as it is for traditional 7 note diatonic scales and modes like Major, Dorian, etc.

Many people who "use the Pentatonic Scale" do so only for MELODY, and still create the <b><u>harmony</u></b> from whatever the Pentatonic Scale is a subset of (typically major or minor).

So in essence, you've got "normal music" with a melody that leaves off two notes.

This would be possible with Hirajoshi as well, so it depends on which approach you want to take.

I do see a point though I think walnut881 was trying to make - and that is, you can't really just "pick a scale and make music". Instead, you should ideally have a reason to pick the scale in the first place - other than "I'm interested in using it". IOW, it would be better if you kind of thought ahead of time, "I have this idea for a piece and I need a scale with these characteristics" and then discover that Hirajoshi is that scale.

But I get it - it's fun to experiment with these different scales to see what kinds of sounds you can get out of them. It just depends on if you want your pitch material to come exclusively from the pitch set of the scale, or if you want to just use that scale over traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, I mean, it's just something they're saying. It's not like a "thing" or anything.

But it's not baseless - I mean, most of the music most of us listen to and want to play and write is "key based" or descended from "key based" music. So it is an important concept.

Especially if you're doing any kind of traditional music theory, which is typically Tonal Music of the Common Practice Period, which is ALL ABOUT Keys.

Are you in college?

Even if you're not, if you're studying Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, it is ALL ABOUT KEYS! My students used to groan but for attendance every day I handed them the same blank chart of the Circle of 5ths that they had to fill in. Some got 100s after the first week, and others took a while, but eventually they all got 100s consistently. And they had to do it all semester.

But it's SO important to understand your keys because that's what all the music is based on from that time (and still, in many cases, today).

And when we say "scale degree" or "Supertonic Note" or "five chord" or anything like that, we are "speaking in keys" - "major scale", key, "minor scale", key, "leading tone", key, Neapolitan Sixth, key, "five of five", key, functional progression, key, cadence, key - so yeah, I mean, it's all referenced back to keys.

So if you haven't learned them yet, you might want to ;-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In part, SA is designed to help us see "underlying commonalities" and on some level a "single, core principle to which a particular style adheres to".

This is a vast oversimplification, and it's kind of an in-joke, but I'll put in the way you might hear someone jokingly (or derisively) say it:

"SA tells you that all Tonal music has I-V-I harmonic framework and 3-2-1 melodic framework."

The idea (in part) is that music is based on this rather simple framework and is then "fleshed out" by the composer.

One aspect of SA is "stripping away" these layers.

This is probably a better explanation than I can give here:

http://schenkerguide.com/whatisschenkeriananalysis.php

And that entire site is a wealth of information on SA.

______

Rather than "scattered" and "unrelated" SA analysis works (partly) in a similar way to Roman Numeral analysis.

For example, if we look at bunch of pieces of music, they're all in different keys and will have different chords.

BUT, if we turn the notes into numerals, a clearer picture of an underlying structure becomes visible - "hey, look, all these pieces keep ending V-I. and they start on I. And there's always a IV or ii somewhere leading to that V, and gee, look at how many of them go I - vii^o - I6 - ii6 - V7 - I - just TONS of them".

That similar progression might not be as apparent if you don't "numeralize" the chords.

Furthermore, we can take this a step further and say that, while there are many many pieces that go I - I6 - IV - V7 - I, what becomes apparent is many of them operate more like this:

I - [variable] IV or ii - V7 - I

That allows to go, wait, they all sort of go "Tonic - ? - Pre-Dominant - Dominant - Tonic.

And they do. That's what we call "Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>".

So the fact that a lot of music uses "Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" is revealed when we strip away all the "less important" notes like non-chord tones, and the "less important" chords - like an inversion that just follows the root position of the same chord and so on.

So SA works kind of similarly - it takes away the "unessential" elements to reveal underlying structures at various levels.

It would still be an oversimplification to say that it "seeks to reveal that all CPP music is based on this one precept".  Because while it does do that, it also looks at other "strata" in the musical texture too - just like the examples about similar chord progressions, then down to the Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> level.

Dig through that site and I think it will answer a lot of your questions.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Since you play Cello and Piano, I would say start there!

Try to write a simple Melody with Accompaniment piece, where the Cello plays the melody and the Piano takes on the accompaniment.

Rule 1 is, don't expect Beethoven on your first outing. People hold themselves to WAY too high a standard - you don't have to write a masterwork your first try - even Beethoven didn't. Spend some time making sketches and "rough drafts" and experiments.

It does, as others have suggested, help to "analyses" existing music - but you need to start simple with that as well. But you should not only look at the kind of chords being used, but the FORM of music as well.

It might be really helpful to watch the video series on You Tube by Seth Monahan about classical <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but one of the important ones is on "sentence form" and also it's good to understand musical phrases and periods.

It would help to play some pieces to see if and how they follow those forms.

For example, the simple melody of "Ode to Joy":

E E F G G F E D C C D E E  D D - notice it ends on scale degree 2 here, then that phrase is answered by:

E E F G G F E D C C D E D C C - end ends on scale degree 1, the tonic.

So this is what's known as a "Parallel Period". It's Parallel because both phrases begin similarly. It's a "period" becuase it has two phrases that both reach a cadence, but the first ends on scale degree 2 and a V chord, making it a "half cadence" and the second ends on scale degree 1 and a I chord, making it an "authentic cadence". The Period is defined by having one phrase, called the "Antecedent Phrase" end on a "weaker" or "less conclusive" cadence and the other phrase - the "Consequent Phrase" end on a "stronger" or "more conclusive" cadence.

This form is found over and over again in all kinds of music.

And that brings up the next point - you should find pieces to use a "models". You know how artist's use models? Because they need something "known" as a reference point to work from.

That's what composers do too - you don't say, "I'm going to write something and start "doodling" with no plan - if you have no plan to sculpt from marble if you mess up you either crack the marble or can't add material back! You could of course "doodle" and come up with an idea and then "craft" that into a piece - that is in fact common.

But it's more productive for most people to work from a model - it's sort of "paint by numbers" in a way that way. I know that can sound like it's not very creative but it's common practice to work that way.

Find a little 16 or 32 bar waltz or something like so:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnIxEUGjg0

Notice that the accompaniment in piano here is just a couple basic chords, always played in a basic waltz idea. The melody also is very repetitive - it uses the same material in terms of rhythm, and in terms of melodic contour, over and over. (and can you see how the first page is a Parallel Period?).

A lot of beginning composers, besides thinking they have to take the world by storm with a masterpiece, also often mistakenly think that what they write has to be new and daring and never heard before, and that's just not a good approach. Likewise, even if they don't go that far, they feel like at least each measure has to be something new and that is just not the case in real music. It's OK to repeat ideas - it's economic. 

So try to start putting some ideas down like this example or similar ones. The cello doesn't always have to play high to play the melody, but since it, can, it can.

As you get better, you can do stuff like give the Cello the bass line and the piano RH plays the melody, and so on.

But "keep it simple" to begin with is a good mantra!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Depends.

When we say "the melody", we either mean the highest sounding part, or the most important part that is presented as or we hear as the melody.

However, it is possible to combine multiple melodies simultaneously, or have a melody and a "counter melody", and even accompanying parts can be considered to be highly melodic if not melodies themselves.

If you're talking about 4 Part <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in terms of a Bach style Chorale, "the melody" was actually a pre-existing melody that would be familiar to people, and would be harmonized with the other parts. The Soprano part always got this.

So the Soprano has the melody (the Hymn tune) and the other 3 parts accompany it.

But, in 4 Part Choral Works, the melody could be sung in the Tenors while the other parts sing around it.

In Barbershop Quartets, which are in 4 Part <b><u>harmony</u></b>, the "Lead" gets the melody, and another part (called the Tenor) actually sings above it. So this is like the Alto having the melody.

The Bass could have the Melody.

You very well could also have a 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> that serves as an accompaniment itself, to which an additional melodic part is added.

Your word "derived" is a little tricky - I wouldn't say the melody is "derived" from anything.

I know this sounds like a cop out, or defining a word with that word, but the melody is what is the melody! It's hard to explain but you have to know what a melody is by listening to tons of music and identifying it. It's actually hard to define because if you say something like, "it's the thing you can follow" or "it's the thing that stands out" there are other musical elements that meet that definition - one can for example usually easily follow the Bass part in a 4 Part Chorale, but it's not the melody (but that is one of the reasons it can be considered "a" melody or very melodic even though it's not "the" melody).

Why do you ask, or what are you trying to accomplish?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So let's start with Harmonic.

Since every Minor Key has a Major Key that shares the same Key Signature, and thus the same notes and chords, there is a tendency for Minor Keys to "drift" towards the Relative Major.

For example, C Major and A Minor have the same notes and chords and key signature.

If you play bVII - bIII in A Minor, it sounds exactly like **the defining progression in Major*, V-I - that's because it's G to C.

Minor Keys don't have that same V-I relation and thus they lack the "defining" chord progression or cadence we really feel we need in order to make it sound like the Am chord is the "home" chord, and not the C chord.

So something had to be done to "force" the chord progression to point towards the Am chord, rather than the C chord.

What makes the V-I so unique is that the Leading Tone is contained in the V chord - the 7th note of the scale - and it has a strong tendency to lead to the Tonic (hence the "leading tone" name).

But Minor doesn't have that.

So, we made it have it!

We changed (or composers back then did) the 7th note in minor by raising it one half step, so it would sound the same as it does in the Major key - only a half step away from the Tonic, and thus "leading to it" more strongly.

But we did this within a Harmonic context - IOW, not only so it would change the note, but the CHORD it was part of.

When you raise 7 like this, it changes the minor v chord into a Major V chord - in Am it would change the Em to an E Major chord.

Therefore, it would be V-I in major, but v-i in minor, but by changing the <b><u>harmony</u></b> by changing this note, it becomes V-i in minor - now BOTH major and minor keys have a V chord - the Dominant chord - Dominant <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, that "leads to" the Tonic chord.

This makes for a stronger resolution in Minor, and also prevents it from drifting back towards major.

So we "raise 7 for a harmonic reason" - to change the <b><u>harmony</u></b> from v-i to V-i.

To explain this, people had to come up with something to show others. This was the "harmonic minor" scale - a minor scale that was altered in a specific way (raising the 7th note) for a "harmonic reason".

The resulting scale is just sort of to show what happened - but in a really oversimplified way.

______

As far as Melodic Minor is concerned, it's a similar thing. When the 7th is raised for the harmonic reason, the distance between it an the 6th note increases forming an augmented 2nd. This interval is kind of funky and hard to sing (especially at the time). So the solution was simply to raise the 6 too when it was leading up to raised 7.

So in a melody, if 7 was raised as part of a Dominant <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, it the melody approached the 7 from 6 it would need to be raised as well to prevent this awkward gap.

However, if the 7 wasn't raised because there was no harmonic reason to do so, then 6 didn't need to be either.

Generally speaking, raised 7 tended to appear when it was "leading to" the Tonic note - which would be going up.

But when going down it was often not necessary because you were going AWAY from the tonic - so no need to point back to it.

So in order to show this in an oversimplified way, we get a "Melodic Minor Scale" - one where 6 and 7 are show raised when the scale goes up, and in their "natural minor" positions going down.

Thus scale degree 6 was also changed when a melodic situation necessitated it.

_____________

The best way to understand this really is to play some music that uses them this way.

If you take a look at this piece:

https://www.musicnotes.com/images/productimages/large/mtd/MN0096480.gif

 you will see instances of 7 raised for a harmonic reason (beat 3 of the first measure) and both 6 and 7 raised for a melodic one (beat 2 m. 2) and back to natural (beat 4 m. 2).

We don't really say the piece is "in melodic minor" though that would cover all the note content. It's more about how those altered and unaltered notes are being used. The D is made to D# in m. 1 to "lead back" to the E note and to make the chord a V chord (it's just B and D# but we understand that to mean the V chord) while the alterations in m.2  are more for "melodic" purposes - the D# does again lead up to the E so we could say that is harmonic, but the C# is raised so we have a smooth melodic line moving from B, through C# up to D#. On the way down to B though, the notes change to D natural and C natural.

So you could say, the notes change depending on where the composer wants them to "lead to" - towards the tonic note, or away from it.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You can "add a melody to" a 4 part arrangement. It could "dance around" all the notes without necessarily following any of the existing lines. It could, in effect, have the soprano note as its first note, and then the alto note as its second note.

It's hard to say without specific examples, but this is pretty much what any guitarist who strums chords and sings along with the chords is doing.

They absolutely do not care about voice-leading.

The chord is Am, so they sing an A, C, or E.

They change to a C chord - they can jump up to G from A (considered bad voice-leading) or really whatever they want.

your voice COULD be one of the 4 parts as well, or double one of them. But it might sound kind of funny if you sang the 3rd of a chord, and played C and G on the instrument - if the timbres of the instruments are too different - especially if more than one part is on the same instrument - then they won't "blend" like you expect.

So usually, a melody on a "solo" instrument (one that is different from the accompanying instrument(s) ) is it's own thing, independent of the 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and though it could be one part itself or double an existing part, it's more likely that it is going to be "on top" of everything else, or an independent line within the rest of the texture.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes.

Obviously though, just like you should be considering the melody in terms of harmonic and non-harmonic tones while analyzing harmonies, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> should also be considered in a melodic analysis.

But melodies can be taken out their harmonic context as well because the way we describe them isn't as tied up in <b><u>harmony</u></b> as the reverse.

Generally speaking - and I don't know of any systematic procedure - melodies are analyzed by things like their Pitch Contour, their High Point(s), whether they are primarily Conjunct (stepwise) or Disjunct (skipping, and also whether that involves "outlining harmonies or not) and whether they are primarily Diatonic or Chromatic. The Structure is also analyzed in terms of form, phrase length, melodic cadence (which can be distinct from harmonic cadence) and then especially, Pitch/Rhythmic motives (including contrapuntal permutations like inversions, retrogrades, etc. If you've ever looked an analyses of Contrapuntal pieces, a lot of this comes to the fore and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is secondary in a lot of cases. The "character" of the melody can also be discussed - "static", "angular", and there are terms for some types of melodies especially in fugue subjects. There are "compound melodies" and melodies that display characteristics such as "octave displacement", and there are "counter melodies" as well (which generally are analyzed with their main melody counterpart to show how they interact and what qualities they share or differ by). Melodic Sequence is an important constructive principle and there are Real and Tonal Sequences. Of course we can talk about what Scale or Mode they're in where relevant, and in Atonal music talk about the Set and the intervallic progression of the melody especially in places where the interval vector is laid out neatly or manipulated in other permutations.
____

There is "Rhythmic Analysis" as well, but the amount of terminology and again any kind of systematic analysis is not as well described. Obviously we can talk about Meter, and Durations, Rhythmic Motives, retrogrades, rotations, Augmentation and Diminunution, things like Hemiola, use of tuplets, polyrhythm, polymeter, cross rhythm, and stylized rhythmic units used like "Claves" and other Rhythmic Ostinati, and things like Isorhythm (which has a melodic component as well). Obviously, Syncopation is a big issue, and we can talk about Stress, Stress Accents, and things like that. There are some rhythms associated with some types of pieces (durational stress on beat 2 of a Sarabande) and pieces like Barcarolles, Tarantellas, Marches, Waltzes, etc. have certain rhythmic expectations, and in South American music some of these aspects are extremely important (those pieces that alternate 3/4 and 6/8 for example). There is "Harmonic Rhythm" the rate at which the <b><u>harmony</u></b> changes and we also look at melodic phrases that continually begin with an Anacrusis (pickup note(s)) as "shifted" in relation to the meter in a way. There are - these are old terms so no one get their panties in a wad - Masculine and Feminine cadences (whether they fall on a strong or weak beat) and so on. There are pieces like "Divisions" which are like Theme and Variations, but each variation is more a rhythmic aspect than melodic one - each repeat of the theme is broken into, say, 8ths, then triplets, then 16ths, and so on. Some of that principle appears in regular T&amp;V as well, but these are more part of Spanish music.

____


Then there's analysis of form :-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You use what are called "voices".

The low C would be a Whole note.

Above that would be a quarter rest, then a dotted half note E with the stem up.

Then above that on beat 1, a half rest, then the half note G stem down.

Then on beat one above a dotted half rest, followed by the quarter note B upstemmed.

An alternative to this would be to notate each note tied to the next value, so, for example, you would have the half note written as two quarters tied together and the last note B stemmed TOGETHER with the last quarter note of the tied G (so they look like a chord).

You could do all of some portion of the chord this way. All is possible, and it allows you to stem them altogether which can be neater looking. So beat 1, quarter note C, tied to beat 2 quarter note C with an E added as a dyad, then beat 3, both the C and E tied to  another quarter note C and E, then the G added above, and so on. This gets really fussy with ties, but it eliminates the need for rests.


The issue here is, if the notes are stemmed together they need to be the same value. It's only if they are in different voices can they have different durations.

There are other ways to notate it, like with each note just as a quarter with a tie "to nowhere" behind it, and the indication "l.v" for "let vibrate"  or nowadays the tie to nowhere is usually good enough.

http://www.rpmseattle.com/of_note/l-v-symbols-in-sibelius-laissez-vibrer-several-solutions/

Finally, depending on the instrument, you may not need to notate it at all if it's clear (in your context, since the notes are so long, you'd probably need clarification though). In Guitar music and in Piano music we often have arpeggio chords and the assumption is to just hold the notes for the duration of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Especially on Guitar since it's only one staff - trying to notate all of the notes their exact durations gets really tedious.

This sounds more like a though experiment than an actual thing you need to do, but the best bet it to look at published music and see how they handle it when dealing with multiple voices.

Depends on what you mean. I can't give you any specific examples but the Tritone Sub is a "sub" for V. The original music would have had V7 - I and someone subs bII7 for V7. That's how it works.

There may be famous recordings or recordings by famous players that use it when it wasn't originally written that way, and there are pieces where writers have used them that way intentionally (whether the piece is famous or not depends).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Learn every solo you can. Learn every song you can. Learn parts of solos, or parts of songs. It doesn't matter. Just LEARN MORE.

Santana's solos are often very melodic and not technical, so easier to get under your fingers and into your "mind's ear".

Journey (Neal Schon actually was in Santana's band) has a lot of great melodic solos, though there is also usually some blazing lick - but don't worry about the blazing licks, get the melodic parts down.

First solo I ever learned was the one from Don't Stop Believin' - it's just the vocal melody basically.

Another good pretty easy one (because it's slow-ish) is the one from REO Speedwagon's "Keep On Lovin' You".

Learn "Manic Depression" by Hendrix - the rhythm part.

The solo is a bit weird but get as much as you can.

Learn all the Zeppelin "riffs" - Whole Lotta Love, Heartbreaker/Live In Love In Maid, Black Dog (a bit tricky but worth at least getting the movements down), Immigrant Song (not even a solo in that song - not all songs need them!).

"You Shook Me All Night Long" by AC/DC. The Dual <b><u>Harmony</u></b> lines in "The Boys Are Back In Town".

Learn as many licks, or parts of licks as you can. Grab some of those licks from Freebird and just run them over and over until you can do them without thinking.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ok, if the "rule" is "avoid doubling the 3rd" and you "need to stick to them" then it doesn't matter why. That is, if you want to pass the exam.

The real reason is simply that you are learning to write a style where the composers didn't double the 3rd (in root position I assume we're talking about).

Are you putting Blue Notes in your 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b>? No, I doubt it. Why, because *it's not part of the style*. Neither are doubled 3rds on root position chords (with one particular exception).

They didn't use "Power Chords" either. That means you can't either.

Suck it up, learn the rule as is without questioning it, and pass the exam!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ha ha - yeah, jazz doesn't need to get involved ;-)

The reason I'm asking is because a lot of what you're asking isn't really all that worthwhile.

Notes, and Chords, don't necessarily have any inherent need to resolve or anything.

But, in the context of Keys and Tonal music - which is a lot of what most people want to play - there are certain traditional things that happen.

But, they are really context driven so it's difficult to give absolutes.

Generally speaking, "tendency tones"  have a "tendency to resolve" as the name suggests.

The big one is scale degree 7 - the "leading tone" - Worthy of its name as well, it's tendency is to "lead to" the tonic.

So if you play a Major Scale up and down and all around and then land on scale degree 7, it's going to sound like it wants to resolve to 8 (which is 1).

But, you know,  you don't HAVE to - and many times people don't because they want to intentionally thwart your expectations.

Probably the next biggest resolutions are other ones that involve half steps - 4 wants to resolve down to 3, and b6 wants to resolve down to 5.

But again there are plenty of reasons not to - this assumes that you'd be resolving these to the tonic chord, but you don't always do that.

So these kinds of resolutions are VERY broad generalizations.

________

Also traditionally, any time you altered a note it would want to continue in the direction of alteration - so if you were playing G, and went up to G#, then the G# would probably want to go on up to A.

This happens a lot, but again, it doesn't HAVE to. But, because such moves usually happen with a <b><u>harmony</u></b> (as do most of those tendency tones above) you do hear them fleshed out in a harmonic context more often. This would be important as a bass player who might be handling such a line.

But, it should be clear that chromatic notes like that could also just be "embellishments" and there's all kinds of those that don't necessarily follow those same principles (because theyr'e more "melodic" than they are "harmonic")

_______

The other big family of "things that need to resolve" are Non-Chord Tones and Dissonant Notes in Chords (or Dissonant chords in general).

Traditionally, a 7th in a chord should resolve down by step.

But that's 1719 and 1819, not 2019. You don't HAVE to resolve them today. You CAN if you want that sound, but you don't if you don't want that sound.

_______

So it's kind of hard to say anything really concrete without concrete examples.

My advice would be, as always, to learn more songs and figure out how other people approach it.

Honestly, I know how it is - people play an instrument and want to "do more exciting stuff" than they are often called on to do. But really, a GOOD bass player is one who can lay down a groove and stay in the pocket, both holding down the low end and driving the music forward.

I don't want you "jamming" and "improvising" when you're playing with me. I want you "adding to the music" not "showing off"!

Now, that said, of course I don't mind players improvising - I like it in fact - but it has to be "tasteful" and "done with experience" - which comes from learning how others did it and adopting their techniques.

For a lot of Blues - let's take a 12 Bar Blues - you need to be able to lay down the bass line SOLID - because it's not your job to improvise - that is the job of the instrumentalist, or singer, or whatever. You need to "provide the harmonic outline" when a chordal instrument like guitar switches to playing single note lines.

Now, of course, you can improvise, but it works best if it's "around the core" of what it the basic harmonic outline is.

Check this out:

https://youtu.be/Zyhu2ysqKGk?t=181

So John Paul Jones is still hitting like the root of the I, IV, and V chords while he's doing all this other busy stuff with Plant singing. Since there's no guitar here, he is the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

He's implying the chords, giving some rhythmic impetus, and  playing "improvisationally" all at once.

So he's still maintaining the "core" of what the 12 bar progression is, but adding some "froo froo" in there as well (and some funky rhythm).

Obviously, this sort of section is designed for that and when you'd want to hear a player do this. But at other points, it's better to lay back and handle the groove (depending on what else is going on).

This,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mFxUIH5IaE

on the other hand, has a bass line that is basically implying a single <b><u>harmony</u></b> throughout the song, and is  pretty meticulously rigorous - holding down the groove and being the foundation for the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (G scale riff).

There are a couple of spots where he improvises a higher pair of notes (and he does that same thing a number of time) and a spot here and there where he adds a rhythmic division.

I would really encourage you to learn how to "lay down the foundation" like this before you worry too much about improvising too much, unless you're really already really solid (like you can play this Bass line in the War song, and many others like it, hold down a 12 Bar blues while others improvise - I know - they get all the glory, but hey, you picked Bass :-)

_____

So I think the tension and resolution aspects are not as important as these more practical situations. I'd be more concerned if you didn't know your chord tones and what notes to play if you were given a 12 bar in A and said "ok, go" - you have to be able to play through a situation like that.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You would have to do this (notes in parentheses would typically be held rather than repeated):

Bb - (Bb) - Ab

G - Ab - F

That would be a 9-8 suspension (with a change of bass).

Or:

C - Bb - Ab

Ab - (Ab) - F

10 - 9 - 10

This makes the Bb a Passing Tone.

or

Ab - Bb - Ab

C - (C) - F

where the Bb is a Neighbor Tone.

You actually could have an Appoggiatura here (in your original), but leaping up the 7th from C up to Bb would be pretty unusual leap. In strict counterpoint, dissonant leaps like that are not allowed.

In practice, if the <b><u>harmony</u></b> were all part of one chord such as an Ab9 chord, it could happen (in music probably later than Beethoven which is not generally what we'd consider strict counterpoint! In Bach, I'd be very surprised (though I'm constantly surprised by stuff so I won't say completely impossible)).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well here's something I found on another site which seems to have good sources available:

&gt;" Mozart greatly admired Sebastian Bach’s music. It’s not clear when he first encountered the old master’s music (i.e., did he ever played the Well Tempered Clavier as a child?), but at the age of 6 he befriended Sebastian’s son Johann Christian Bach (the “London” Bach), and JCB was certainly influential in his musical development. We do know that in the 1760’s Mozart was playing and studying Sebastian’s instrumental and keyboard music at the behest of his friend (and patron) Baron von Swieten, who would stage weekly private concerts featuring music of both JSB and Handel. Mozart, like many other composers, was drawn to Bach’s absolute mastery of polyphony and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and we also know that he went so far as to transcribe at least ten of JSB’s keyboard fugues for strings (transcribing another musician’s work for other instruments was a tried and true method for learning compositional techniques) and all of this study had a direct effect on Mozart’s music; there are many examples: the Jupiter Symphony’s fugal finale, the later piano works, the Requiem, &amp;c. We have Mozart’s own letters where he (humorously) tells of his wife’s pleading with him to compose more fugues (she falls in love with them) and to write them down this time, dammit! The proof is in the pudding: if Mozart hadn’t valued the music of Sebastian Bach it wouldn’t have had such an effect on his own work.

&gt;But perhaps the best evidence that Mozart had more than just respect for Sebastian’s music can be found in the charming eye-witness account from his 1789 visit to Leipzig, and to St. Thomas’s Church, whose cantor, Johann Doles, studied with Sebastian Bach as a boy:

&gt;"At the instigation of Doles, the cantor of the Thomasschule in Leipzig, the choir surprised Mozart by performing the motet for double choir, 'Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied,' by the patriarch of German music, Sebastian Bach. As soon as the choir had sung a few bars, Mozart started; after a few more he exclaimed: 'What is that?' And now his whole soul seemed to be centered in his ears. When the song was ended, he cried out with delight: 'Now, here is something one can learn from!'

&gt;"He was informed that this school, where Sebastian Bach had once been cantor, possessed a complete collection of his motets, which were preserved as if they were a saint's relics. 'That is right, that is fine,' he exclaimed. 'Let me see them' There was, however, no complete score of these songs. He therefore took the separate parts, and then, what a pleasure it was for the quiet observer to see how eagerly Mozart sat down, the parts all around him, held in both hands, on his knees, on the nearest chairs. Forgetting everything else, he did not stand up again until he had looked through all the music of Sebastian Bach. He asked for copies...." (source The New Bach Reader, David, Mendel, &amp; Wolf)."
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think the best way is by PLAYING the music!

But, with that, comes the understanding that you are not only playing it, but "actively thinking about it" as you play it.

I think one of the benefits of "sight singing" using solfege is that it forces us to think about what we're doing while we're doing it. When we play music, we're often more worried about just getting the right notes in the right rhythm in the right order! So we can't really "pay attention" to the *sounds* we're making as well as we could.

Obviously, just listening to tons of music in a similar style is important, but to take an example of active listening, let's say you were listening to a bunch of standards and you say, "wait, that sounds like this". Then what you should do is figure out what that and this is! "Oh, that's this bVI7 - V7 idea". So as you play those kinds of progressions, and listen to pieces, you should start recognizing those progressions within the music.

And one of the reasons I keep telling people to concentrate more on their instrument is that this is sort of a "next level" thing - you have to be able to play proficiently enough that you no longer have to think about what you're playing, but can truly listen to what you're playing. For example, if a guitarist is still trying to form the shape for a C chord one finger at a time, any amount of ear training is not going to help them pl,ay better, and it's doubtful they'll be able to use that training to identify things that they aren't really able to play/

So playing - and playing proficiently are the first steps.

Then actively listening and identifying things while you play (and while you listen) is the next step.

Working on sight singing is another tool for helping with this.

I would place next, learning songs by ear, as it has more immediate practical applications.

Drilling intervals is fairly useless.

Now, if by "functional" ear training you mean in terms of tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, then yes, that's more effective IMHO because that's the music most of us want to play. For example, I don't really every go "oh, that's the interval of a m7". Instead I go "oh, that's the tonic up to the b7" or if it's part of a chord. "that's the root, and oh, there's the 7th" - I don't even really care about the *interval* at all. I'm more interested in "what is this note" and "what is this chord" - not it's distance from some previous note or chord.

So I think thinking intellectually is the least useful - at least until you get into atonal music. But most people just aren't interested in that, and the ability to transcribe that by ear might not be all that useful in the grand scheme of things.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>To inject Jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you just inject jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Play a 7th or 9th instead of a triad or power chord. Mission accomplished!

The true answers to your questions are - learn to play jazz. Sorry, there's no "shortcut".

The answer to your last two questions are "when you want that sound".

And "jazz" is a HUGE field - there's a lot of different between the jazz on the 1940s and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> that arises through the 60s and then more modern experimental/avant-garde jazz and fusion styles.

Here's an example: There's something called the "Bebop Scale". But you're not going to learn a scale and be able to play Bop. You need to learn the songs - the music.

Another is your statement about Blues Scales - it "doesn't make sense" because you're not doing it by SOUND - instead, you're sitting here "thinking" about it. Music is not words, it's sound. Learn some blues tunes or some jazz-blues and see how the notes work. You can absolutely use a blues scale over a dominant chord - it's frequent - that's what creates the "bluesy" sound - the minor interval against an otherwise major context.

Play 20 pieces that all do that, and it will "make sense".

If you don't "get" that, then all the other information anyone can give you isn't going to help you.

You need to learn the music first, then come back and figure out the theory. You need to sit down with a chordal vamp and play different scales over it and see what they sound like.

Good Luck.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Because the style of music that evolved was based on Counterpoint.

The main idea of Counterpoint was to combine independent melodies within a harmonic framework.

In order for melodies to maintain some level of independence, they can't "follow along" with another melody.

Think of many modern pop songs where there is a vocal <b><u>harmony</u></b> that harmonizes the lead vocal - we usually hear one pretty clearly as the "lead" and the other as the "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" (ignoring things like volume or timbral differences for now).

That makes the 2nd line "dependent" on the first - it can't really exist on its own without the other so to speak.

So in counterpoint, *contrary* motion is more desirable because it prevents one melody from becoming dependent on another by kind of just "mirroring it" at some other interval.

Some intervals, like 3rds or 6ths - you can take for longer runs because they change from major to minor within the key. But 8ves and 5ths remain perfect (all but 1 in 5ths) in the key. This means the added line becomes more obviously dependent on the other - it just sounds like a "doubling" rather than an independent melody. This is especially true of 8ves (which no one ever seems to ask about!).

They also have the side result of lessening the harmonic component - especially in 2 voices.

And, they kind of "stick out like a sore thumb" (they may not to us today, but back then they would have).

They draw unwanted attention to themselves - and that too is contrary to the point of counterpoint! Textures are usually largely consistent of sound and balanced texturally, and for any upward motion, it's usually "countered" by downward motion.

Any parallelism can make it sound like the music is "too directed" - too much going all up - it makes it suddenly sound like there's this upward thrust in the music - especially if all voices do it which kid of upsets this otherwise balanced texture.

So really, similar motion in general is less desirable, then parallel (or consecutive) motion is even less desirable, and then parallel 5ths and 8ths are to the point of being undesirable. The same is true of "Hidden 5ths" (Direct 5ths) and 8ves as well - it's the whole "draw unnecessary attention to the interval" problem again.


HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>To answer your edited question, Parallel 8ves are used for "doubling" and "strengthening" and "adding weight" or "adding brilliance" to a line.

They are avoided in contrapuntal textures because of the "dependency" issues I mentioned before.

If you have two voices playing independent melodies, but then they come together in parallel 8ves (or think about if it were unisons!) for 4 or 5 notes, those 4 or 5 notes are not going to produce <b><u>harmony</u></b> - just a single (not 2 independent melodies either) melody that's being doubled.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Learn some!

Iron Maiden is a great resource for all things "harmonized guitar lines" which I assume is what you're asking about.

Many other two guitar bands were known for their harmonized lines as well.

Def Leppard's "Bringing on the Heartbreak" has a nice <b><u>harmony</u></b> intro line that's more than just "in 3rds".

Same with the break in Thin Lizzy's "Boys are Back in Town" - not always 3rds - check it out and see if you can figure out what's going on (it's a pretty easy one).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>True, but it shows you how it works in relation to the chords underneath.

3rd is super common, and 6ths are used sometimes. 8ves are of course very common but not really "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" per se. 4ths and 5ths are somewhat rarer but are useful for certain effects.

You can run things in strict parallel, or you can change directions or change intervals.

The harmonies in Almann Brothers songs are generally switching between 3rds and 4ths as they play Pentatonic licks, but sometimes they add the 4th scale degree in there ("Hexatonic Scale") which changes things up.

George Lynch from his Dokken years did what he referred to as something like "haphazard" <b><u>harmony</u></b> where he didn't run them parallel like Maiden or similar bands, but would just put in notes he felt "sounded good" (typically chord tones).

Scorpions was another good band for harmonies.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In jazz, yes.

In other music, no.

OK, I'm being a bit silly, but:

Jazz players (especially many not-as-well-informed-jazz-players-who-have-access-to-write-whatever-they-want-on-the-internet) have a tendency to "subsume" melody tones into chord tones.

Let's say your <b><u>harmony</u></b> is C7, but the melody goes C-D-E-F# over top of it.

Jazz players will often say that the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is C9(#11).

They do this for a couple of reasons - one is that in giving that as the <b><u>harmony</u></b> symbol, it tells someone who is improvising that F#, rather than F, would be a note choice at that time.

Most of the time, Jazz analysis is not as much to tell what the theoretical underpinnings of the chord are, but to inform players for improv purposes.

If it were classical music, that D and F# would simply be passing tones (assuming the F# went on to G in the next measure).

In classical music, it's wrong to use "extensions" because they (and we) simply didn't (don't) conceive of the music that way. You might see analyses online that do this, but the people don't know enough about traditional (academic) analysis and are trying to apply a "jazz" (or pop) analysis to the music, which is really uninformative.

In popular music, it can kind of depend on how "Jazzy" it is.

But also, context can be important - in a pop tune where a long sustained B is used over an A7 chord we're probably going to say it's an A9 sound.

Now, that's not to say Jazz players don't also use passing tones and so on - they do. It's just more likely that tones that would be considered "non chord tones" in classical music will instead be considered chord tones in Jazz, especially if they conform to standard extensions and alterations.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Music theory is reactionary - it reacts to evolution in music itself.

There was no theory for Atonal music until Atonal music existed. Then music theory reacted by including it.

There was no theory for Blues until Blues existed. Then music theory reacted by including it.

Whenever a new major style emerges (I mean Major, not just a new genre like "chill" or "wave" type genres people come up with daily) if it contains elements not already contained in the system, new concepts and terminology will need to be developed.

As long as music continues to evolve, theory will continue to react.

______

Likewise, there can be "undiscovered" elements in existing music where trends in music may have flown under the radar or, someone is able to look at them a new way and describe them in a new way. We might, for example, realize that someone like Bernard Hermann was using Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in a way that no one had noticed before, and that those he learned from and those inspired by him who adopted this technique created a continuum that can be identified and defined. This can help to explain why some number of seemingly unrelated pieces might all sound more similar than we expect for example.

_____

There will also be new discoveries of manuscripts, both of musical works and of theoretical texts - either of which could shed new light on thought or performance practice of the time.

For example, we knew the French used "notes inegales" and they were explained, but we had no idea how they were played, and the notation used was just standard - just like how modern swing is written in straight 8th notes but not played that way.

But they discovered some Barrels from a Barrel Organ that matched the melodies of some of these pieces and by reconstructing them realized that they actually played the notes "unequal" and now we understood more how it was done as these barrels essentially constituted a "recording".

Things like this are constantly happening, but unless you read theory journals you might not be aware of them.

Try here for some "discoveries" and things you might not realize are going on:

http://www.mtosmt.org/

Interestingly there's an article about the "animation" of performers to see if how much they move affects perception of the quality of their performance.

I had noticed a trend in YT performances of more recent recordings of players about to fall out of their seats trying to "over-emote". It's gotten to the point where it's silly now.

But their study draws a correlation, so, it makes sense.

Cheers
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I would state that a different way.

It's not the "theory" that leads up to atonality, but the music - the very things you mention.

Just for an example, composers were using "color chords" long before anyone came up with a word to describe what they were.

Chopin was using chords of stacked 5ths before anyone came up with the idea of "Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" (at least in any well-defined-as-we-know-it way).

Now, I'll grant you that the 20th century was also one of experimentation, and a theoretical concept, or an "idea" could absolutely lead to some musical realization of that idea - for example, I think some things, like Polychords and especially Polytonality (as used early on by Stravinsky et al) were more likely a result of musical thought than a direct evolution of music.

And Fetis did predict an "omnitonique" era.

But as a general rule, the music has to come first, then we create a descriptor for it. We had to have a fair amount of Atonal music before "Set Theory" as Forte put it down was of much use.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>C-B-C-E | D is a **melody** in quarter notes, 4 beats per measure, so each note is after the other, C followed by B followed by C followed by E followed by D.

Then the <b><u>harmony</u></b> under that is a C chord (making C and E chord tones, and the B a lower neighbor, not a "true" 7th), and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> under the D note is a G chord (D being a chord tone).


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Please allow me to share my thoughts on this by way of analogy:

Lev Termen invented an instrument we now call the Theremin.

It was unique in a number of ways. One is that it is played by *not* touching it, which means a totally different way of thinking is necessary because there's no tactile feedback, only aural feedback. The other is that it can play any frequency, including microtones.

Now, I feel this should be the penquin meme:

[Invents instrument you play by not touching and can play any note]

[players develop method for playing precise pitches and play "The Swan" on it]

IOW, here's this amazingly different instrument and what do the dumb humans do with it? Figure out how to play "Frere Jaques" on it. :-/

My personal problem with music like in the link you shared (and this is my take on it, others may disagree, YMMV, etc.) is that we are not going to move into any kind of microtonal compostional world until people start actually taking advantage of what microtonal instruments offer and composing music specifically for them that can't be played on other instruments.

Now, by that last part, what I mean is yes, one can not achieve the microtonal intervals on some other instrument, but from the opposite perspective, really most of this so-called "microtonal" music is simply "out of tune regular music" or "regular music played on an instrument that allows microtones".

IOW, IMHO, there needs to be PURPOSE beyond just doing it.

I don't care to hear Beethoven played in Just Tuning. Don't care.

What I want to hear is a new work, that is not "major and minor triads, in a different tuning than 12tet".

You know, Ligeti and Penderecki did more to advance microtonal music (albeit in a "sound mass" setting) than what a lot of people are doing.

I don't want to hear a looped beat, with 4 out of tune chords looped above it, and people getting all wet in the knickers because the word "microtone" is thrown out. Shit, if you're going to do that, call it negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> too, and say it's epic, and you're using God chords, and that'll really bring 'em in!

_____

If I had to pick any trend I see at least art music evolving towards (and it already has started), I'd say the ideas of "aural events" - "sonic immersion" are going to be the "next" thing (unfortunately, to a drum beat).

Sound for sound's sake - sound, in time, but, like our society, fragmentary, ADHD, "soundbyte driven". This may include microtonality, but it will more likely be just one of many tools used to achieve these sounds, rather than any kind of over-riding tuning system or compositional approach.

But if I could predict who would win the Mega Millions, I'd be typing this on a better computer :-)

My 2 Cents.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ok, there are a couple of considerations here. Firstly, taking a highly tonal melody and trying to recast it modally may fail miserably.

That brings up tons of questions that need to be addressed before you do it - IOW, sometimes you may WANT to do something, but it may not be the best decision.

Why do you want to use this particular melody?

Why do you want to recast it modally?

Why do you want to make it Lydian as opposed to some other mode?

If the answers to any of these are "just because I wanted to" or "just because I thought it would be cool", well, I hate to say it like this, but that's not a good enough reason. I don't mean that as bluntly as it sounds, but what I mean is, some melodies just simply aren't going to lend themselves well to recasting modally.

It's far better to no "recast" things unless they already lend themselves to it.

In Bach's Chorales, some of them are modal melodies that Bach "tonalized" by adding certain accidentals. Others though are actually more Modal (especially the Phrygian ones) as there's less of a way around it.

One of the main considerations here is that we are "Tonally Biased" and conditioned  - even "brain washed" to hear and conceptualize things from a Tonal perspective.

Therefore, if a melody is strongly Tonal, it's virtually impossible to change it - it MIGHT - MIGHT be possible in some cases to change it from Major to Minor more easily than to some other mode, but some other mode is usually far more difficult, especially Lydian, which tends to be the trickiest of them all because of its overwhelming tendency to sound like a Tonal scale (that is, it just sounds more like Major starting on the wrong note, rather than it's own mode).

What this all means is that when people work with modal music, they generally tend to avoid all trappings of Tonality at all costs.

Thus, functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is gone.

Furthermore, since each mode is already close to major or minor, but has 1 (or 2) different note(s), it is that note that is focused on.

In Lydian, it is imperative that the #4 appear in the melody or the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or both.

Lydian is a really tough one though.

Effective chords would be I and Vmaj7. But it has a huge danger of "re-orienting" to the V as the Tonic - so emphasis on the I is important.

Other progressions like I - iii - vi - I can work with the Lydian Melody over top - and probably more effectively because by avoiding II and V(maj7) you avoid the risk of that V sounding I or it just sounding like constant V/V progressions - such is the case with the movement of Beethoven's String Quartet subtitled "In the Lydian Mode" - it's not really Lydian, just I - V/V - V essentially (again, we hear it from and he couldn't help but write it in a tonal world).

I - vii(7) work well. I - II is often problematic, especially if the V is there, as it will make the V sound like I again. But vamping back and forth can maintain the I chord as the I chord.

This is the reason there are so few Lydian pieces now. It's too close to the common modulation to and tonicization of V for us to "unhear" it.

Tom Petty's "Here Comes My Girl" is a great example because the intro and verses vamp on A to B and do have a "Lydian-esque" vibe to them, but when it hits that big E chord in the chorus, it's E.

Now I realize that's not a Hymn Tune Harmonization but that is the issue - we can't "unhear" or "unthink" our tonal associations so easily, especially with Lydian, and a completely different approach is necessary.

No.

No symbol implies voicing, though many incorrectly assume so, or try to use them so. To drive home the point, what is the voicing of "C"? or "C7"? Why should C9 be any different? They tell you what the "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" is.

&gt;I know that both G6/9 and G9/6 

Well, the symbol is G6/9.

The other one is from people who don't know what they're doing.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Please,

Imaj7 - bIIImaj7 - IVmaj7

This ain't Nashville :-)

It's hard to explain these things. The truth of the matter is that we are just used to sounds like these. We're not super used to them so they don't sound "run of the mill" and they're still a little new and "fresh", but at the same time, it's "Just a Major 7 chord".

I - bIII - IV is a super common sound.

Maj7 is a super common sound (or, at least, it's a sound we're familiar with).

The principle of "Constant Structure <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" is a common one - this is where the same chord form is run up and down in parallel (and before CSH it was just called "Parallelism" or "Planing" - Debussy probably already did it back int he late 1800s).

So you're dealing with sounds that are "acceptable" to us. No one besides us musicians are sitting around worrying about where they "came from", so people play them them, and hear them, and accept them, and are fine with them.

That means you shouldn't really "need" to "justify" them  (though some people seem to feel that need).

But, if it helps, bIIImaj7 is a "Borrowed Chord".

If you were in C Major, and had Cmaj7, Ebmaj7 and Fmaj7, the Ebmaj7 is the III chord (bIII if you like) from C **minor**.

This is called "Mode Mixture" - you take chords from the "parallel mode" and use them in the mode you're in - so in this example, you take a chord from C Minor and use it in C Major.

Whether that's where it "comes from" (if you didn't know this first, and then created the chord progression, obviously it "comes from" you happening across it!) or not is maybe a philosophical question, but we can at least note the connection in this way and thus "name it" (rather than trying to justify it).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Forget "playing the Am Scale".

Think "the notes from the key of Am".

Forget scales at all.

Let's think about a piece in Am that has a Dm7 chord in it.

Think of the notes of the key, in relation to that Dm7 chord:

A is the 5th, B is the M6 (like A Dm6 chord) or 13, C is the 7th, D is the root, E is the 9th, F is the 3rd, G is the 11.

Now you shouldn't "play an Am scale" over that chord - and just changing it to "D Dorian scale" doesn't solve that issue! It might orient the notes more to the chord tones depending on how you play it, but otherwise the results are - as you say - bland.

You want to use the chord tones, then use the other notes from the key as passing tones and neighbor tones, and ideally, as little melodic motives and ideas.

Also, consider this: When Autumn Leaves is in Am, isn't EVERYTHING just from Am? The melody notes, aside from the alterations on the V chord, all come from Am. So do the chords.

So in essence, the song itself is "only playing the Am scale throughout the entire piece when in Am".

Yet, it's not like people think that piece is bland and uninspiring (well, a lot of people think it's a great song).

This song is actually pretty basic. 3 notes in a row then a jump. All in the scale, that goes with the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

We could say it like this: What makes you think you have the right to mess with perfection!!!!! :-D

Seriously though, "invoking modes" doesn't "improve on it". [elitist voice on] "I'm using the SuperLocrian in Negative Tonnetz Space to provide a C# on the Dm7 chord".

BFD.

It's called a chromatic note. It's a neighbor tone.

Take a cue from the melody - maybe, to improvise, take the jump from the melody, or the 3 notes in a line - and use those to build a motive (like the melody itself) that moves throughout the chords.

I totally could see myself starting a solo by starting with the inversion of the main melody - same idea, going down instead of up, and building on it.

And when I do, I'm not going to be "I am playing the A Minor Scale".

I'm going to be, "here are the notes from Am that fit this chord and allow for the motive I want.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think you mean F-A-C-E to be one chord, yes?

That would be Fmaj7. It is, every other note, starting on F (and all those notes are in the key of Am).

G-B-C-E may not look like every other note, but it is if you re-order them:

C-E-G-B - this is Cmaj7, also all part of Am.

When you re-order notes into "every other note order", it then tells you what the "Root" is - the first of the every other note order. So since C is the first of every other letter order here, this is "some type of C chord".

F-A-C-D, re-ordered, is D-F-A-C - again, all from Am. It's a Dm7 chord.

E-G-B-D is already in the right order - Em7.

Those chords that are not in every other note order with the Root on the bottom are called "inversions".

We'd say they're inverted forms of the same chord - Cmaj7 in inversion.

Inverting chords changes the sound a bit, but we still understand them to be the same <b><u>harmony</u></b> they are when they're not inverted.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>NO Texts are designed for "self-study". They are CLASSROOM texts - all these - Gauldin, Kostka, Payne - they all taught at the same college. Other people taught at other universities.

Here's the deal: Ever college professors think they have a new and better way to look at theory. Their university is demanding they publish, and they're demanding something revolutionary worthy of the top name school they teach at.

So these authors have to come up with an approach that works in the classroom, because that's where they literally test it out - using students as guinea pigs.

In their defense, we all supplement our texts with our own materials we think are better. That's what they did, but at some point they're like, "hell I might as well make a text".

But all of those texts are decidedly intended to be used as classroom supplements.

"Self studying" theory is really not practical, and not really possible beyond some basic fundamentals.

Any books that claim to be such a resource are really just trying to sell more books.

None of them are perfect, and they all have different approaches. It will largely depend on how you learn which will be most effective. From that perspective, it's actually better to own a number of texts - Gauldin, K/P, A/S, M/C etc.

FWIW, I prefer Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> for classroom instruction. The Gauldin is an excellent book though, with a different approach. 

Right now, I think the best thing out there for TONAL music is Seth Monahan's video series on YT - unfortunately, he's in the process of "writing his own text" (which are these videos) and it's only up to chapter 22 and I'm sure there will be many more.

But it lays out Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in a way that is far more applicable to actual music than most "abstracted" layouts of conventional texts do.

But his is also meant as a companion to his lectures and exercises - again, not a "self study" beyond what you can understand.

"Music Theory for Dummies" from the famous series is just as good as any $300 text. 

A C Major chord consists of C, E, and G, whether the book costs $5.00 or $500.00.

What exactly are you trying to learn - and what exactly do you already know (this is why a live teacher is good, because they can assess these things and design a curriculum accordingly)?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Granted, these are different systems, but this seems very convoluted to me.

I do know that there are some who see the +6 family of chords as not being "b6" chords, but as being various forms of II or IV (or VI iirc). So they see a German as an inversion of a IV chord or something of that nature.

This bothers me because it's usually by the same people who call a vii^o7 /V a "#iv^o7 ".

So it seems like it's "neutering functionality" by sort of "reducing it to a numerical formula".

I've always thought that's fine if you KNOW the symbol #iv^o7 actually means vii^o7 /V.

But the problem arises with pop music where you might get a true II rather than a V/V. Or ct^o7 chord and other passing forms.

Kostka and Payne may have gone overboard in their text with this, but I actually do like the approach they take:

Essentially they move away from the word "chord" and go for the word "sonority" for things that have origins outside of or pre-date Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b> (like 6th chords from Faux Bourdon days) and for "simultaneities" that don't form Tertian triads and are more a result of voice-leading.

For these they use "names" rather than numerals, so the Neapolitan Sixth is "N^6 ", and all the +6 family are "It+6, Fr+6 and Ger+6", as well as what I just mentioned, the "ct^o7 ".

It's an interesting approach which eliminates the need to come up with numerals for these chords and worry about their inversions. The first inversion is implied in the "N^6" and if +6 chords are inverted (which is rare anyway) they call them "o3" of the same name. IIRC they consider them "rootless" in the sense that they're not really tertian triads (which kind of goes to what you're saying about the Neapolitan if I'm reading that correctly).

But essentially many of these could be seen as alterations of II and IV, thus Pre-Dominant in function. And that's how they usually behave.

Where K/P are looking for the "name" to be more important is when you run into something like a "stand alone" N that doesn't resolve to V, or when you have a "Ger+6/I" - meaning rather than being built on b6 it's built on b2 (and thus akin to the TTS in jazz as bII7).

IOW, if you had to call the one leading to I some kind of V or VII chord, it might become more confusing.

It's really hard to see Db-F-Ab-B as some form of altered V chord (in classical, not jazz) - though you could certainly make a case - but I think we also don't generally want to assign Dominant Function to a chord that barely resembles a Dominant (Tritone aside).

So that's kind of the logic behind these "named" chords - which seems pretty widespread.

Like I said, seems less convoluted to me, but at the same time, you still have to know what they mean so it's not that different than reducing them to numerals instead.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's so hard to say.

Obviously, one of Schoenberg's goals was to *avoid* "tonal trappings" and at least for him, in order to do that he went into serialism.

I suppose we could take "Music on a Long Thin Wire" as one extreme, where you just get one note. So not really "tonal". But also not <b><u>harmony</u></b> of course.

On the other hand, we get to Ligeti and other "sound mass" composers.

So you're right - we have things to describe what happens, but not really to tell us "how they did it" so to speak (which is really what theory does anyway - descriptive not presecriptive).

And it seems like everyone just came up with a way that worked for them.

So I know it sounds like a bit of a cop out, but yeah, as u/jazzadelic said - just use your ear.

You have to discover it for yourself.

I'll add though that I think you have to be mindful of what might be a trap you're setting for yourself - i think when you say it never works because there's some forces that push it towards some center of gravity...well, that might be a learned response from you. Just as a quick example, I've played Palestrina for people and they go "it ended on the wrong chord" - it doesn't, it's just they're "hearing it with tonal ears". So one potential issue is you might be doing the same - since we're often trained that way at the start, it's difficult for us to "unhear tonality" - and that's probably why some composers have gone to such extremes to avoid it like the plague.

However, I'll also say that in some cases they weren't necessarily "avoiding" it, but just exploring other ways of making music - so I think that might also be a potential trap for you - just reading your post I would say, well, why do you feel you need to write non-tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> in the first place? What's wrong if it pushes towards some center? Is that necessarily a bad thing?

So you may be setting up impossible goals for yourself!

And also, you know, all pre-Tonal Modal music is non-tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but quite well-balanced. That doesn't sound like what you want but again, it doesn't have the tonal trappings, yet uses familiar harmonies and so on. And so does a lot of contemporary music.

So it really depends on how you want to define these things - which of course is again, up to you, and sorry for the not-very-helpful-conclusion, but something you have to figure out for yourself.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are "rules" for ROOT POSITION TRIAD 4-Part writing that you should know as a point of departure.

Here's what you need:

1. Doubling Rule - how many of each chord member is present and which, if any, are doubled. The answer for **Root Position Triads** is two Roots, one 3rd, and one 5th (RR35) with specific exceptions.

2. Spacing Rule - distance between adjacent pairs of voices (S-A, A-T, T-B). The rule is simple: No more than an octave between S-A or A-T. The Bass may be more than an octave away from the Tenor. Also, no less than a unison between voices - no voice crossing. There are exceptions to these rules but they should not be used when learning - learn the rules first, then when to break them.

3. Rules for motion based on Root to Root distance. There are generalities and specifics, as well as some exceptions that are important to know. Too many to explain here, but can go over them one at a time if you'd like.

4. These rules are for ROOT POSITION - TRIADS in FOUR PARTS that are doubled RR35. They do not apply to first or second inversion chords, they do not apply to 7th chords, and they do not apply to mis-doubled or mis-spaced chords. Following the rules for mis-doubled or mis-spaced chords may cause them to continue to be mis-doubled and mis-spaced, and if use for 7th chords, or other inverted chords, will provide mixed results only very few of which work. Therefore:

5. For anything that does not meet the above criteria, you fall back to Rules of Counterpoint. It would be ideal if we learned those first but most people (in school) are taught 4-Part <b><u>harmony</u></b> first (as described above) and Counterpoint second. At any rate, 4-part writing of root position triads is the CORE of most of the music, so you'll get the bulk of it right. And the exceptions and 7th chords, etc. aren't too hard to learn and some have their own rules.


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Form.

As u/tasker_morris said:

&gt;Music is linear. Composing is not.

The idea of starting at note 1, then writing note 2, or starting on measure 1, then writing measure 2, and so on is often a dead end.

I always use the analogy, most authors don't just sit down and type "It was a dark and stormy night..." then just keep on adding words until they have a novel.

Instead, they think about a plot line, then the characters, then the setting, any plot twists - is it a murder mystery or a romance, coming of age or reflections on life, a moral dilemma or slice of life, etc. All this is usually decided before they write word one.

And they make outlines, rough drafts, move things around, write, and re-write, and so on.

So one of the biggest problems I see with composers - and it's the common reason they can get 8 or 16 bars but then get stuck - is that they're thinking from the inside out, rather than the outside in.

What are you writing? Piano Solo. Great.

What kind of piece is is going to be - prelude-like, song-like, is it like a Nocturne, a Waltz, a Fantasy, an Album Leaf, a programmatic piece, etc.

What form is it going to be in? Binary? Ternary? Sonata-Form? Rondo? Through-Composed? Is it going to be Home - Store - Home, or is it going to be a Journey? Will material repeat, will ideas come back? Will they appear the same, or be modified? Is it a Theme and Variations? A Theme and Various Presentations?

How long will it be - a couple of minutes - 15 minutes?

What "mood" will it be? Lively, grave, bouncy, jazzy, poppy, etc.?

None of these have to be written in stone and can evolve as the piece evolves.

Then you can start working with your musical ideas - take your initial idea and make some variations of it. Try setting it as a melody against chords, then a melody against a counter-melody, then a melody against just a bass line that implies chords. Try different accompaniment patterns - I've written pieces where the main melody in 4/4 comes back in the end for a "maestoso" section in 3/4 (I was so proud of myself when I did that!).

There are so many possible variations and ways to set things - think of it like a character in a book - they can show up in different settings, different clothes, different positions, and even different ages.

I get the whole "this sounds like something else" thing - I have a real problem with that myself. A huge problem.

But one thing that can help is to just go ahead an use an idea you know is from somewhere else. Like if I were to write something like a "13 bar blues" (I have) I would not feel like I had to come up with some completely new chord progression - I'd just use a standard 12 bar form and add a measure. Because if I don't use the standard 12 bar, I'm not really writing a "based on 12 bar blues" piece.

And look, I'm sorry but you're already doing all stuff that's all been done before.

Piano solo? Yeah, that's really original. Yawn.

Chord progression? Yawn.

Chord progression that's not only sequential, but super common, yawn.

Minor scale? How original.

See - nothing you do is original, so don't get hung up on it - and don't fall into the trap of "I've got to come up with an original chord progression" or "I've got to use a scale no one else has ever used before" - that's silly and an exercise in futility.

It's OK to use the English Alphabet and English Language Vocabulary and Grammar to write your novel.

That's a moot issue - it's a non issue. It is what it is. You're going to use pitch, timbre, and volume, and melody, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and rhythm (to simplify).

Coming up with gobbledygook words and Yoda Speak for your novel, or writing it in some new Alien language isn't going to make it "original" (at least in any meritorious way besides singularity) or even good.

But put your character John Smith into a though-provoking situation and develop that character throughout the story - that's where the goods are.

Your chord progression and melody is just a character in a setting.

Now, what do you want them to do? Go exploring? Sit on the porch in a rocking chair watching the world go by? Engage in self reflection?

It's up to you, but you need to make some "big decisions" as Bob Ross says and think about how you want this musical material to "live" within the piece.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Sequential is a sub-type of direct modulation, where you do something like run through a series of sequential chord changes to get from point A to point B.

C - F - Bb - Eb - Ab - Db etc.

Melodic Modulation is when the <b><u>harmony</u></b> drops out and you have just a melodic line that gradually "morphs" from one key to another by adding more and more accidentals. Often this is a sub-type of Common Chord Modulation where the melody implies the harmonies but it can just include a lot of chromaticism and so on 

[notes not chords] C - F - G - F - E - D - C# - D - E - Bb - A - etc. could take you from C Major to Dm for example.

You can also have melodic phrases that are sequential themselves, that modulate you to new keys:

[ditto] C - E - D - C - D - F# - E - D - E - G# - F# -G# - now you're in E or A, etc. That's a simplified example of course but that's basically how they work.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think it's a tad confusing. They do say "do not add embellishments unless..." but then you've got the inversion symbols...

So we would have never had anything like this, but you know, I can figure it out by context. I'm not sure that *most* theory students could if they've not encountered anything like it before though.

I haven't seen enough of it to say whether or not other embellishments are common - you could do quite a bit with it and I've seen examples in texts where almost an entire voicing is spelled in Arabic Numerals. But it seems a little "paint by numbers" - it practically becomes keyboard tab if you like - so I'm not sure how useful it is in testing someone's knowledge about general voice-leading principles they should have learned...

As for the cadential 6/4, I've not yet seen any way of notating it that actually teaches students what's going on! I think - at least the way I learned and the way we teach theory - a stronger background in counterpoint is really necessary to "get it". But we usually don't bother with that.

Kostka/Payne write I6/4 - V but put a bracket under both chords that says "V" so the idea is it reinforces that the cadential 6/4 is not really a chord per se, but a simultaneity of suspensions that form a chord we can name, but really functions as something else.

You can see it right at the beginning of this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4mXK1Znb1s

If you google Cadential 6/4 and do an image search, you'll see a lot of examples of various way people use the Arabic numerals.

Our university switched from K/P to Aldwell/Schacter (much to my chagrin) and you can see examples of this craziness:

http://www.sfcmtheory.com/<b><u>harmony</u></b>_supplements/chap_19.htm

!

I think they use all Uppercase in the text just like WP.

Certainly, as an educator grading papers, I want to see if a student really knows that a iv chord is minor in a minor key, and "IV" only tells me they've figured out the root, not that they know the quality. So I prefer the K/P for classroom instruction.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I applaud your enthusiasm!!!

So let me see if I can confirm some things for you - and oddly enough these really are "basics" that a lot of people seem to miss - I think becuase they get interested in a lot of other stuff and don't realize they've missed this stuff!

So yes, in traditional minor keys, the "v" chord is changed to "V" by raising the 3rd of the chord, which is also the 7th note of the Key and we call it the "Leading Tone". This is a common practice and part and parcel of the aptly named Common Practice Period.

In fact you're right - there should be a Ton - if not ALL V chords. "v" chords in minor keys (I'm speaking of traditional CPP music) are pretty rare comparatively speaking - and when they appear it's usually for a specific purpose.

It's kind of funny about the Cadence - I want to smack you over the head and say "of course you fool!" :-)

It puzzles me that people don't get this - but I'm glad you learned it!

So yeah, and ending is a Cadence. We usually consider a cadence to be either the final chord of a phrase, a section, or the final two chords of a phrase, a section, or a piece.

So you can hopefully easily see that at the end of what you posted this has an E chord moving to an Am chord - V-i in Am. That's called a "Perfect Cadence" (in some countries they call it a "close" or "full close" sometimes - kind of an older term as well).

A lot of us in the US call it a "Perfect Authentic Cadence" because both the V and i are in Root Position, and the final i chord has the A note on top.

This is considered the strongest of all cadences - or "the most final-sounding" and things like that.

BUt just to be clear - and what I think a lot of other people confuse - the whole excerpt you posted goes - not counting the first measure - V^(7) - i - V^(7) - i - V - i .

Now, not all of these are cadences.

Usually we say only the final one is "the" Cadence.

Though with an ending like this, it is possible that the second to last pair of measures (before the last two big chords) could have been a cadence if the piece ended there. Sometimes someone might - for illustrative purposes say the "real" cadence in in those two measures and the two ending chords are just a "tag" or re-iteration. But generally speaking, it's going to be the final chord and the penultimate (second to last) chord.

Also since you were mentioning about figuring out some of the Dominant things without all the notes, I should note that in very clear contexts we should be able to infer <b><u>harmony</u></b> when implied by the context - so that last octave A note before the last two chords can be considered a "stand in" for an Am chord - so it "represents" a "Tonic <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" even though the entire chord is not there - And this is supported by what we just heard a couple measures earlier!

So yeah, you're pretty much right on with everything. Excellent job!!!!

Maybe work through some of the rest of the piece and post your results and we can help you along some more.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Historically speaking, the "correct" way to do it is to harmonize a melody rather than "melodize a <b><u>harmony</u></b>".

But so many people have done the latter for so long it's completely acceptable.

And I think the answer to your question is, "it depends".

Usually the alterations are for melodic reasons - for example one reason to have a 7#9 in bluesy stuff is the m3 over the root of the chord that's often the b3 or b7 of the scale (I and V chords). We spell it as a #9 but really it's a b3 (compared to the root of the chord) over the otherwise natural 3 of the chord.

So the "rub" there is actually created by the "altered" melody note (or we could say, the melody note adds an alteration to the chord) rather than it being part of the chord itself.

But it is absolutely common to pick scales based on the chords.

For example, usually over a 7alt you play what equates to Jazz Minor (Melodic Minor) starting a half step above the root.

C - E - Bb - plus the alterations G# and D#, and the possible alterations (b5 and b9) Gb and Db give you what is essentially a Db melodic minor:

(C) Db - Eb - Fb - Gb - Ab -  Bb - C - Db

Notice the C-E-Bb (E is Fb) and #5 (Ab) and #9 (Eb) in there.

Sorry, spelling it with sharps doesn't make it any easier, but obviously C# melodic minor gives the same results enharmonically (and Db minor doesn't exist as a key signature - I just chose it because of the Bb in the C7alt).

F7alt works the same way.

Since they're a 5th apart there's a number of common tones between the two scales.

Mm7 might take harmonic minor, but melodic minor also has the basic notes as well. You might want the Gb as it's in the other two scales (b9 of F, b5 of C) but then again you might like the flavor change to G.

And that brings up another strategy, which is to find as many common notes either in all 3 chords or between adjacent pairs of chords and exploit them, "filling in the remaining" notes with ones that "work".

And of course, you could just go completely chromatic and have it "work" if it's done the right way.

So it all kind of depends on the context.

BTW one reason Pentatonic often works is because it has fewer notes to clash, and those that do tend to be "bluesy rubs" rather than outright "avoid notes". But my idea of looking  for common notes is a simlar strategy - if you can find a "scale" of some sort that works for that, great, but it could just be a subset of some other scale - which is essentially what pentatonic is anyway.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;the 7th scale degree is almost always raised.

I think we often say that to drive home a point but really, it's not exactly true.

the 7th is only raised on Dominant function chords. So it is not generally raised on bIII chords, and definitely not on i7 (Im7) chords.

It's done for "harmonic" reasons, which is to turn a non-dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b> (v or bVII) into a dominant one (V or vii^o ) and where we get the concept of Harmonic Minor "scale".

bVII does appear, but it's typically as part of what might as well be a V/III chord, so we could disallow that one if we wanted.

Minor v is most commonly encountered in the i - v^6 - iv^6 - V kind of passage.

There are also plenty of chromatic descending bass lines that include minor v (almost always v^6 ) as in the Crucifixus of Bach's B Minor Mass or Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (Dido's Lament) - actually called the "lament bass" as a ground bass pattern.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Usually, Pentatonic Scales are used as a Subset of Major or Minor scales and <b><u>harmony</u></b> (chords) are derived from the KEY and melody will be too, just simply restricted to only 5 notes out the possible 7.

If you want to build chords out of any scale that's not a traditional 7 note scale or something we use tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> with, you can come up with something like "every other note" - so many people have made chords from pentatonic scales like so:

C-E-A

D-G-C

E-A-D

G-C-E

A-D-G

So you get two familiar triads, and three quartal chords.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;we make systems to describe chords and base <b><u>harmony</u></b> on chords, that is just a consequence and categorization of whats really happening, which is voice leading. 

Not really.

We might say that <b><u>harmony</u></b> as we know it originated from the consequences of horizontal lines being put together. Counterpoint. <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is, a result of multiple melodic lines. Any Vertical structures are a result of Horizontal motion.

However, as these verticalities became recognized as structures in their own right, they were "emancipated" if you like and became vertical structures independent of any horizontal considerations.

Most music exists in a spectrum of horizontal and vertical emphasis, from monophonic chant which is not harmonic, to chordal stabs which are not melodic at all - and everywhere in between.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> may have evolved from voice-leading, and there is much music still written that way, but it has evolved past that point now to the point where it can stand on its own, independent of any voice-leading concerns.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, I'm not sure what school you're planning to attend, but have you contacted the composition area coordinator?

At my university, which is a National Association of Schools of Music Accredited University, with one Composition faculty who is fairly well-known and respected as a major contemporary living composer, and another who is a Moscow Conservatory graduate, we don't expect you to know much music theory or sight singing coming through the door.

I mean, you should have a general grasp of chords and how to put together melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> to make a little piece, but counterpoint? No.

That's what we (at least) have a Counterpoint class for.

That's why they ask for a portfolio - you should be able to show them PIECES you've written (or parts of pieces, sketches, etc.). They don't want to see your command of 2nd species.

But who knows - every university is different. Email or call up the composition faculty and ask them directly. Of course they're going to tell you the more you know walking in the door, the better off you'll be, but from the sound of it, and your example, you'll be in first semester courses along with everyone else, so you should really be putting the effort into the thing that's going to help you the most - which if they say the portfolio is the deciding factor, and that's pieces in various styles, then that's what you need to spend your time and energy on unless of course you're already burning off a piece a day or something like that and have or will have plenty to bring in.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>First of all, let me say that a harmonic analysis of a contrapuntal piece is not always all that informative. Counterpoint is written linearly and though it maintains some vertical connections, those are less important to the piece than the horizontal elements.

What the video is showing you is exactly that. Notice that the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is not even mentioned.

Instead, the colored elements are different motives that are used to organize the piece.

IOW, counterpoint is not so much built out of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but built out of motives instead.

If you look at the first green box, you'll see it repeated in the LH twice in measures 4 and 5 - it's that rhythmic motive (dotted note with 3 16ths).

Also, as typical of Bach-style Counterpoint (and many others of course) the LH "imitates" the RH so you'll notice at m. 3 the LH has the blue followed by the green.

The LH part here enters on the Dominant (scale degree 5, or E) whereas the original entered on the Tonic (scale degree 1, or A).

There are absolutely "harmonic regions" but it isn't really necessary (or helpful) to spell out the <b><u>harmony</u></b> for each and every move.

It starts in Am. The 3rd beat of the 2nd measure introduces the D#, which seems weird, but it's introducing the leading tone to the key of Em, which is what the appearance of the main motive (blue) is going to be in the LH here. So you can think of the chord as a V of the V chord, or V/V (that's a basic function mind you, not the exact chord, which is less important - it's more important in this kind of context to understand the role it's playing, not exactly what it is).

The 3rd beat of measure 4 introduces a C# and Bb, which are acting like V or vii^o of the key of Dm which sets up a little sequential passage or "episode" where we basically have measure 4 repeated down a step for measure 5 (with a slight, not-so-important variation).

Since it's the same measure down a step, it leads us by way of introducing B natural, Ab, and naturalling the C (and the F note is there too) to something that's essentially a V or vii^o of a key down a step again - C.

It repeats the main motive (blue) again on E, but essentially the LH part turns from what we thought might have been C into Am.

Measures 7 and 8 should obviously be another sequence - can you see how it's the same material (colors give it away) down a step?

Interestingly the accompaniment notes produce some "mini-modulations" again similar to what we just had - going through Em, then via A7 to Dm, then E7 on to m. 9 which is pretty clearly Am (all this passage is in Am, I just said "mini-modulations" to compare it to the larger chord centers it's going through.

It sort of does the same stuff harmonically again - Am, then the big run on Dm but the last beat has the F# and G# which point to E7 (so i - iv - V7 progression)

m. 11 could be considered a ii^o <b><u>harmony</u></b>, then it moves to the pretty obvious E in m. 12 that even whacks you over the head with the held bass note - and though it's in grey, the idea that's playing in the RH in 12 is pretty clearly derived from the opening idea.

Then at 13 - important point - we get the return of the main motive (blue) in the Tonic key (Am) then basically some more of these chords that point towards another chord in the key (like mini-modulations as I'm calling them - that's not what's really happening - they're just tonicizations, but I'm trying to show how those chords with the accidentals are from some other key, pointing to a chord that's in Am, but not the Am chord itself).

(notice how the green motive follows the blue again here)

You get a little Dominant to Tonic back and forth with the flourishes (sort of the "big finale" of this "little" prelude) to end on i as we'd expect.

So the chords aren't really super important - it's basically i - iv - V7 with a few secondary harmonies included to lead to those chords, and some sequential passages (super common after you introduce your motives, to then treat them sequentially).

Sort of the "important" parts are where the blue motive comes in, and what note it starts on (and to some degree the <b><u>harmony</u></b> associated with that) as that kind of pinpoints the "structure" of the piece.

So it IS based on <b><u>Harmony</u></b> on the large scale - or rather, Key Centers - or rather, the Tonic and Dominant "areas" but how the motives are used is generally considered more important than any brief passing chords that go by as a result of combining the lines.

Ultimately, it would be better for you to probably look at the consonances and dissonances and see how they're handled, but in this style, there is a harmonic underpinning that makes consonances &amp; dissonances versus chord tones &amp; non-chord tones worth distinguishing between, so that can be a bit tricky if you don't know either well because it's hard to separate them. But that information sort of tells you more about the notes that were chosen rather than trying to look at it from a purely chordal perspective.

Oh, and BTW, not everyone knows BWV #s, and many might not even know they're Bach. While you linked to a video, it's never a bad idea to include the composer and "common" name for the piece.

And speaking of the piece - a "Prelude" like this is meant to be sort of improvisation so they often won't have the more rigid kind of structure of an Invention/Sinfonia, or a Fugue/Ricercare, etc. So they often use "littler" elements from those things - subjects/motives and imitation, as well as tonic/dominant presentations, sequential things and things we might call "episodes" but everything's on a smaller scale.

In some ways that can make it easier to study, but in other ways it's often better to know the "biggerer" forms to see how these are reduced from that, as opposed to seeing these as starting points the others were built up from.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are probably a number of reasons - for example, psychological and perceptive - C and B are "stark contrast" and by putting some "grey" in it brings the two together more.

Many will cite the overtone series but while the E might produce a stable 5th with the B, the G will be a 3rd. So it's probably more likely to do with our perceptions of consonance and dissonance at that point - the G is consonant with both the C and the B. The E is consonant with both the C and the B.

An interesting counter-argument is that if we take a highly consonant interval, and add a note that's consonant with both notes, it actually makes it more *dissonant* at least according to historical perspectives - so adding an E or Eb to C and G makes a unit that was at least initially less consonant than the perfect 5th.

And adding a consonant interval to a consonance can totally destroy it - what happens if you add an E in between C-Ab - +triad - highly unstable!


Probably the most compelling evidence would be that of the "acoustical root" - that, when two tones are played together, an acoustical root is produced based on where those notes lay in the overtone series (or maybe, more precisely, their ratio to each other).

If, the acoustical root is one of the notes present, and especially if it's the lower note, we hear it as more "stable". C-E, C-G.

But things like C-Eb, C-F, C-Ab and C-A all produce consonances (let's assume the 4th a consonance) where the acoustical root is either the upper note or a note not present in the chord.

This is the problem with the Minor 3rd, as it's root sounds like in the case of C-Eb, and Ab note. But if we add a G - C-Eb-G, the G "trumps" the Ab acoustical root and forms a stronger one (with the lowest note present) and stabilizes it differently (not necessarily better).

Dissonances generally produce an ambiguous root - C-F# actually produces 2 - a D and an Ab.

C-E-G# produces C (C-E), E (E-G#) and G# (G#-B#) all fighting for supremacy.

C and B don't have a strongly defined acoustical root so adding the G sort of "forces" the C to be it and since the B is consonant with the G, we accept it more ready than the "bare" interval.

Now, I think it's worth mentioning that it's all still context-dependent - C6 and Am7 contain the same notes but out of context, A as the lower note with a 5th above is going to have more "A-ness" than a chord with a C as the lowest note with a 5th above.

But, in the context of a piece of music, we can easily over-ride this.

FWIW, in Medieval music and before, there were periods where <b><u>harmony</u></b> was "consonance based" rather than "root based" as we see it now.

In consonance-based <b><u>harmony</u></b>, the Bass note was all important. So you had chords like C-G-A - no one cared that the G and A were dissonant - as long as each was consonant with the bass it was cool - it was considered to "override" any dissonance in the upper voices.

Today though, most of us would consider that a dissonance (at least in the academic sense) because we're basing it on a chord - like C or even Am7/C, where one of the notes (depending on the root) would be dissonant or at least a non-chord tone.

This way of conceptualizing marks a distinction between Consonance and Dissoance, and Chord Tones and Non-Chord Tones, but it's also why things like the Perfect 4th was considered dissonant with the Bass, but OK between upper voices.

C-E-A - the E and A are both consonant with the C, old style, no worries.

E-A-C was bad, because A was dissonant with the bass. And this is actually counter to everything discussed above.

However today, we're likely to accept 2nd inversion triads as perfectly stable and sonorous, and not dissonant in the least.

I'm sure there have been some studies done on it, but I don't know of any specific ones or scientific data. It may be covered in Helmholz's "On the Sensation of Tone" (I think I got that title right).

But one thing to remember is, even if we hear any given element as more or less consonant or dissonant, we often use them in music *in spite of* those factors!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"Timmeh!"

Yeah, in that kind of context - well, really, even the "Composite Blues Scale" is like that - it's not really a scale per se, but a listing of the notes that happen in the melodic parts (typically) but is fluid and changing based on the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Not unlike Bebop scales.

And really, not unlike traditional music.

So I don't know how you're using it but you could easily see how a lot of modern people might write something in C, then slip a D chord in there in the chorus, then make a "composite" scale and say "I'm using C D E F F# G A B C" but they're not really - they're either only added the F# when the D chord comes, or they're switching from C Major to G Major from the verse to the chorus, etc.

So unless you're using all the notes all the time, I'd say if you want to classify or categorize it - even for your own compositional purposes - it might be advantageous to break it down into different sets, or, maybe "primary" and "secondary" tiers - whatever works most efficiently for what you're writing.

Cheers
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You're making sense - it's a good question, one I've seen a number of times over the years.

But I think you're doing something a lot of people do, and that's place more emphasis on chord progressions as somehow defining a style of music rather than all the other elements - which are often far more important.

For example, did Mozart use a b3/#9 over a Major chord? Yes, not infrequently.

But, is it "bluesy".

Not really. Because it's not used in the same way.

But check this out:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFXrMrp1o60

The opening chords sound kind of "odd" to most people.

Or like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwml0jevv0

Some really interesting <b><u>harmony</u></b> changes.

But neither of these are really Haydn or Mozart (and one is as far before as the other is after essentially).

Gesualdo is using some chromatic mediants that wouldn't really be used again until the 20th century and not come to the public's knowledge until they saw Start Trek Insurrection or something (they've become rampant in film scores in the last 2 decades).

So are they "aware" of the sounds - yes. But are they "stylistic"? No.

Just like today, we could easily use a Mozartean Alberti Bass in a song. But do we? No, not unless we want it to sound "old-fashioned" specifically (like "Come Sail Away" by Styx).

And I know you're sort of looking at it from a "predicting the future" issue but you really can't blame composers who worked in a particular style for not using elements foreign to the style. They were just "wrong" and "not done".

So on one level, as music has evolved, it's become more "accepting" of things that were previously considered wrong (but not because they were so much bad necessarily, but just not part of the style).

And certainly, there are moves in Jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b> that many composers might not have even considered becuase from their perspective, they were just too far "out there".

But listen to the opening of this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjZylz3nCwQ

And this is often cited as an earlier-than-jazz example of "jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b>":

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU

along with Debussy and Ravel just to name a few. Granted that's not as far back as Mozart, but you can absolutely find "Circle of 5ths" cycles in Haydn even.

But here's a good example - in Bach's Chorales, out of the 351 in one collection, IIRC there is only one Augmented 6th chord. It just really wasn't part of his vocabulary. But Haydn and Mozart used them all the time.

You didn't really see 7b9 chords all that often (in a stand-alone form) until Beethoven.

And composers in the Renaissance and prior in the Middle Ages didn't even conceptualize <b><u>harmony</u></b> in the same way we do today - so they're not really thinking quite the same way, but they are using sounds we're familiar with.

It really is an evolution.

So I think we can say, Mozart was unfamiliar with what we'd call a 12-Bar Blues progression, or even a "blue note", but many of the aspects of a 12-Bar blues, such as aV7/IV in Bar 4, or the"Turnaround" as a half cadence, or even a minor blues with a bVI7 - V as an analog to Ger+6 - V - these were familiar sounds. IOW, if Mozart were to hear a 12-Bar pattern, he might wonder why the 7ths aren't resolving, and would probably be critical of the voice-leading (as we've dumbed that part down), but the sounds would all be familiar, just used "wrong" in many cases.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'll chime in - both.

Chords come from notes in the key. They're not a separate thing.

C-D-E-F-G-A-B- are the diatonic notes in C Major.

You make your diatonic chords from those same notes.

A D MAJOR chord in the key of C Major would be "non-diatonic" becuase it uses a non-diatonic note - F#.

We'd expect a D#m chord as iii in the key of B Major.

So a D# MAJOR (type) chord would be a non-diatonic chord because it contains a non-diatonic note - the Fx (double sharp) in this example.

Just like the note is called a chromatic note, chords like this are also classified as "chromatic chords" or "chromatic <b><u>harmony</u></b>" (at least, officially, we don't always say that though because some of them are just so commonly used).

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>&gt;Piston's 3 books on Counterpoint, Orchestration and <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

I'll second these, because they're pretty affordable and readable.

But no single book on any of these subjects is definitive.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The deeper answer is that <b><u>harmony</u></b> first evolved along with Diatonic Scales (really, modes at the time) and chords were built from notes of the scale (or mode to be more precise).

The type of <b><u>harmony</u></b> back then was "consonance based", meaning that intervals placed above or below a note were consonant with that note.

Initially, they added one voice to an existing voice, then later they added another, giving us what we'd call 3-note chords or triads.

One issue with 3 note groups is, you might get one note and the other consonant, or the same note and the remaining note consonant, but it's harder to get all 3 consonant with each other.

Basically, they came to prefer forms that had more consonant notes than dissonant notes - still using the diatonic notes mind you, and formed things that we eventually were able to organize in what we call "Teritian <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" - that is, chords of every other letter.

So the Major and Minor triads became the basic unit of <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

And that essentially is taking every other note of a scale - diatonic notes.

This meant there were only 3 possible chord forms, Major, Minor, and diminished, with a 4th, augmented, theoretically possible but not originating in any Key without an alteration to a note.

But since we did it on that one, hey, why not the others?

So now, one can absolutely make a chord out of any notes you want.

However, some combinations will produce chords that are already named.

For example, if you take C-E-G you can raise the 5th to get C-E-G#. You can also lower the 3rd to get C-Eb-G - these are both chords that can be created in the diatonic set, so I suppose they figured they were "justified" in that way.

But you could also alter BOTH the 3rd and 5th, like so:

C-Eb-G# - but that just gives you:

C-Eb-Ab - which is just another Major chord.

So you can alter the 3rd and 5th all you want (altering the root really turns it into something else anyway) but some are going to produce duplicates of other chords. Some of the others will just produce other harmonies like 7th chords and so on.

A common one people ask about is C-E-F# - well, that's just an F#m7b5 without the A.

C-Ebb-F# would just be seen as C-D-Ab, which is basically an Abadd#11 (though could be a Dm7b5, etc.).

Historically speaking, most people have written Tonal Music - key-based music using tertain <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Most of what most people like and want to play is still largely tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>. So they tend to use the triad or the 7th chord as the basic forms, and the diatonic versions of those with a few common alterations, rather than just sort of altering chords randomly. You can alter chords randomly if you want, but by doing it in more limited ways that have evolved over time, it gives the chords a link to tradition that some people want when they make music.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's because - shh, don't tell anyone this - the Melodic Minor Scale is not a real scale!

See, actually, MM is not really a scale at all, but was a mnemonic device to help show how scale degrees 6 and 7 are treated in minor keys!

Generally speaking, scale degree 7 can be altered for HARMONIC or MELODIC reasons! We change it in HARMONIES to make them have a leading tone and dominant function. The "harmonic" minor scale reminds us of that.

But it, along with scale degree 6 can also be altered for MELODIC reasons - and generally speaking, those two notes are raised when MELODIES ascend, and are lowered when they descend.

So those two "scales" - HM and MM, are really just pointing out how the notes in minor keys behave under HARMONIC and MELODIC situations!!!

But, people took them literally as scales.

Now, they do of course appear in music as linear successions of notes - what we'd call a "scale" but CPP composers didn't "use harmonic minor" - instead they just wrote in Minor and altered the 7th for harmonic reasons in some cases, and 6 and 7 for melodic reasons in other cases.

That's why this one scale we learn is different ascending and descending - because it's not *really* a scale, it's more a visual aid.

However, of course, it's been used that way now (and so has HM) and people even make modes from them (and I prefer calling Jazz Minor that, not MM).

So we can say it's a scale now, but really, its origin might be called "synthetic" or "representational" or something like that, rather than an extra member of the Binary Major/Minor system.

I was actually thinking today how up in every scale's butt all these people are - ooh, Harmonic Major, oooh Lydian Dominant, and I was thinking, why aren't people more fascinated with MUTABLE scales - ones that are different going up and down?

You could absolutely increase the number of scales dramatically if it was, say, Ionian up, but Phrygian down or something. Would be an interesting compositional tool. In fact everyone around here seems all up in negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>'s butt, so why not have a different scale going down?

I figured there might be some scales from other cultures that do this and xilopac's post confirms that and offers some to explore. But the principle - we could really apply that to anything.

So, the "significance" of the different notes is basically to show you how scale degrees 6 and 7 typically work in minor keys. Maybe shouldn't be literally taken as a "scale" per se, but people do take the ascending portion (or Jazz Minor) and use it as a scale, so if you want to think of it that way in those contexts, that's certainly apropos.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You didn't say what instrument you play. Simply playing tons and tons of melodies and applying the same thinking to them will help - i.e. pay attention to Key, Chords, Chord Tones, Contour, Sequences, Cadences, High and Low Points, Repetitions, Rhythm, Conjunct or Disjunct, and so on.

Pay attention to all that stuff when you play, and you'll start recognizing those elements when you hear as well.

m3g0wnz mentions "educated guessing" and this is what playing tons does for you "oh, you know, most melodies approach the final note, which is typically the tonic, from a step below or step above"

That sort of can help you identify two of the notes without ever hearing them!

Sometimes when I'm sight reading music, I KNOW a V chord or a I chord are coming, but the notes are coming too fast for me to get the EXACT notes of the chord. But I'll just play the V or I of the key - it won't be the "right" notes specifically, but it will be the right <b><u>harmony</u></b> (usually I get the bass and melody notes right though).

So "knowing what is likely to happen" can help you use process of elimination to get notes you may not hear well.

Of course, ultimately, you still want to be developing your aural skills so you don't want to always "cheat" like this (like I go back and figure out the voicing of the chord I guessed at).

A second thing I want to reinforce is that a lot of people on this forum are very very very too much very very overly concerned with intervals from note to note. While that's important again as m3g0wns kind of implies, it's more important to see the "big picture" and work from the outside in.

I don't really sit around going "it goes up a M3, then down a M6, then up a M3. No way!

I go "it goes from the tonic, to the 3rd scale degree, down to the 5th scale degree, up to the 7th scale degree.

IOW, I don't reference each note from the previous note, but instead, reference all notes to the key center. A lot of times, I don't even care what the interval between two notes is - I KNOW what it is when I identify the two scale degrees, but if someone gave me "this is in C Minor" I wouldn't really worry about it being a m3 instead of a M3 up to the 3rd of the key. I just hear "it goes to the 3rd of the key" and know that's a m3 because of the key.

So it's a different way of looking at things (listening to things).

And this is were Solfege can really help - IF - you learn it as "key referential" rather than "interval referential" (note, that's still a great skill to have though because not all notes are always in the key).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You need to look primarily at Form - form is what makes larger scale works cohesive (well, it makes smaller scale pieces cohesive too!).

In Tonal music, Form is inextricably intertwined with large scale key movements (modulations) and those become important aspects and MUST IMHO be studied along with form.

For example, in Sonata Form, after presenting the material in the Tonic key, it modulates either to the Relative Minor, or the Dominant typically for the secondary theme. In the recapitulation, the same material appears in the original Tonic again.

Now, this is the 21st century and you don't have to write music (and maybe shouldn't) using that specific form anymore, but the **principles** of any form can be adapted and used in modern works as well.

One thing about Roman Numeral analysis - it's fine but only so far. For example, there's a difference between simply analyzing the chords and realizing that "oh my god, this is the same material presented in the Parallel Minor".

So it has to be a "deeper understanding" than just "naming the chords" so to speak.

There's also melody, rhythm, setting, texture and so on. In orchestral music especially, simply re-orchestrating the passage can make it sound "fresh" even though the material is the exact same material. Likewise, changes in texture or accompaniment pattern can do the same thing. Beethoven (especially), Mozart, Haydn, etc. all would often take a melodic idea and present it in counterpoint at some point in a work. So that change of presentation - it's the same "Roman Numerals" - it's the same <b><u>harmony</u></b>, same melody, but it's HOW it's presented that makes it new and fresh.

So when you study music, make sure you're paying attention to as many aspects as you possibly can. You know it's funny, because such an emphasis is placed on Roman Numeral analysis in university theory courses, and I see people here every day going all nuts and crazy about some chord progression, or "how do I make my music sound mystical - what chord progression do I use".

And to be honest, music is not at all about chords. There is actually music that has no chords! There is some music where the chord pattern is pre-established, and is thus not really anything more than a backdrop. What can't you copyright? A chord progression. Because really, it's not what makes a piece of music identifiable.

So, it's not that it's not important, but other things are so much more important in music. That's the stuff people need to study!

My suggestion would be to find a short piece, like a Bach Minuet, or a Haydn Minuet and Trio, analyze it, see what makes it tick, and then use that as a model to try and write your own piece with (if that's the style you're interested).

It would be the same if you were interested in popular music songwriting - pick a piece to use as a model, steal all the ideas, and regurgitate them into something new. That's really how everyone else does it!

But "classical" type music is usually a little more complex and there's often more to discover - but there are definitely "patterns" (called Schemes or Schema) that are used to extend phrases, or are used as transitions, and so on.

If you're interested in that, look up Monte, Fonte, and Ponte in relation to music. You read about those and go, "a ha, that's how all those guys did it!".

Still it's just one small element, but every little bit helps!

Good Luck.

Melodies are often Triadic, following the "natural notes" back from Hunting Horn and Bugle days. A lot of people like using 5ths and 4ths in their melodies, and some are even Quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b> taking that to an extreme.

Double and Triple tonguing attacks on notes are not uncommon.

I think if you listen to a fair number of them, and if you can get your hands on some of the scores and study what's going on, you'll kind of have a much better idea of the typical components. That doesn't mean you have to include those, or that you can't go further afield, but it at least gives you a frame of reference which you don't yet seem to have.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Without seeing an example of a melody of yours that you think is unresolved, there's no way to give any relevant information.

The way you're using the word "resolution" (and its variants) seems like you don't really understand the concept. 

In Tonal music, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody are inextricably intertwined. As a generality, melodies and harmonies both ultimately resolve in Common Practice Period Tonal music.

Not all music is in the CPP tonal style though.

But there can be points in tonal pieces and even entire pieces where melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> remain unresolved for a particular effect.

But if you're writing non-tonal music, that doesn't establish a tonal center, there's no where to resolve to.

So without seeing more specifically what you're doing, it's difficult to give any relevant advice other than to make assumptions like "you need to end on the tonic" - which again is just a broad generality.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>1. You don't. If your progression is in the KEY of C Major, then you play notes from **C MAJOR** for improvisation, etc. Some people will say "you play D Dorian over the Dm, A Aeolian over the Am, and C Ionian over the C" but that's really a bad approach. It's just all C Major.

2. If you're playing in a mode, all of the notes come from the mode for single notes and chords.

3. No, you should use C Major over the Dm chord, because you're in the key of C. You *could* say that you were playing D Dorian, but that's the same scale as C Major.

4. If you want to play in C Dorian for example, you'd want chords that use the major 6th, A, so, for example, a simple progression back and forth from Cm to F would put you in C Dorian and you could improvise all day long in C Dorian.

5. The idea of playing a "scale per chord" is called "chord-scale theory" or the chord-scale approach etc. It's a Jazz thing. Not all music is Jazz. But in that context, what happens is, if you were to add extensions to a Tonic Major chord, like CMaj7, the 11th is likely to be an F# rather than F, so you get a "Lydian Tonic Chord" of CMaj7#11. Thus, in that particular case, you'd play C Lydian over THAT chord. Likewise, if you were to use a V7b9 instead of just a plain V7, so you'd need a scale that incorporates as many notes from the <b><u>harmony</u></b> as you can - which could be a rotation of C Harmonic Minor (which work like modes, but have other names).

6. A lot of people seem to want to use chord-scale theory, or maybe, they just want to sound smart, so they start invoking modes when really all they're doing is playing the Major scale. Either that or they misunderstand chord-scale concepts and are trying to "find them" in places where they're not. If you were playing a Jazz piece that went ii7 - V7b9 - Imaj7, you *might* play D Dorian then C Harmonic Minor, then C Lydian. But if it's a pop tune and it goes Dm - G7 - C, you need to play C Major over the whole progression. Likewise, you could play C Major over Dm7 - G7 - C6 in a Jazz tune. Not all Jazz is modal Jazz.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>One: "Why" anyone says anything is always a mystery! It is definitely rampant among guitarists (I am a guitarist). In some cases, it may be an attempt to "legitimize" the music by making it seem "more academic" than it really is; in other cases it may just be a lack of understanding coupled with a lack of formal training, etc. which of course goes along with this whole "what shortcut can I learn to make music" where things like CAGED, or Lydian Chromatic Concept, or Chord-Scale Theory, and so on appeal to people because it sounds like something special and they put much more weight into it than maybe it deserves (in much the same way people working with classical music see Counterpoint and 4-Part Writing). I'm not saying they're not useful concepts - they are in the styles they're used in, and can be applicable in other styles. They're just simply not "universal" concepts in music.

Five: When one takes a "scale" approach, one does tend to end up "running scales" while they play. But here again is a misunderstanding (again, the same one people have in rock, and classical, etc.). A "scale" is simply a RESOURCE. It's a SET of available notes. Instead of saying "play Lydian over the I chord" people should be saying "the notes you play over the I chord should be drawn from the Lydian collective" (sounds like the name of an alien race on Doctor Who!). Even without modes - people playing pop music playing a Major scale - or as we've discussed - just play a Major scale over I - vi - V or whatever - still no one should ever "just play a scale". We should play MELODIES (or at least melodic motifs) with pitches *drawn from* the key, or the mode, or the pitch collection, etc.

Six: Modal Interchange is with **Parallel** keys for the most part. "Relative" modes are just what we ran into - Dorian over II, Mixolydian over V - but that's all just really Ionian from the I chord. "Mode Mixture" (the classical term) is when you're in C Major, but you use notes from C Minor. But they're both the "key center" of C. "Modal Interchange" is partly the same, but extended to include modal borrowings, such as playing C Lydian, or C Dorian, over a C Major chord. I'm not wholly familiar with the entire concept in jazz though, so it may include other things as well - but more complex than simply Dorian over II, Mixolydian over V, etc.

Disclaimer: There *can be* merit in the "Dorian over II" thinking because even though really, it's all Ionian (or Major!) because it will hopefully cause a player to *focus* on the notes of the II chord - in C, "playing Dorian" is more likely to put D, F, A, and C, on the down beats if you were playing the scale starting on D in 8th notes.

So it is sort of a "hack" way of approaching it. Obviously, if we just play a C Major scale over a ii7 chord in C, it may sound funky. It's kind of like playing A Minor over a C chord in C Major - it's the right notes, right key, and all that, but something can sound "off" about it.

But I think what's happening is this "cheat" is sort of misinterpreted and too much emphasis is placed on playing "a scale" instead of looking for notes within the key that emphasize the Dm7, or G7, etc. harmonies.

So in some ways, seeing a mode like this is like "filling in" an Arpeggio of the 7th chord. And from that perspective it does *orient* the notes over the overall Key to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> of the moment.

So I don't want to totally discredit the approach, but like all the approaches, there's a lot more too it - deeper understanding - than just "play X over Y" - which is what the shortcutters are looking for, and often, unfortunately, teaching.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If a Song is in A Major, you should **not** "play an A Major Scale" but rather, play "melodies" or "motifs" or "melodic ideas" etc. drawing notes from the "A Major Collection" if you like. But we do say "Play an A Major Scale over a chord progression in A Major" - just don't let that be TOO literal or else your improvising sounds like you're just running scales.

If a Song is in A Dorian, then you should play A Dorian over the progression (i.e. draw your notes from A Dorian, etc.).

So when a Song is in a Key, you play notes from the Key. When it's in a Mode, you play notes from the Mode. If it changes key or mode, you change your scales to that key or mode for as long as necessary.

Now, where things get tricky are the following:

Probably, in an effort to keep people from just running scales, some people say things like "Play E Mixolydian over the E chord, and B Dorian over the B chord, then A Ionian over the A chord. So if you have a ii - V - I progression in A Major, you're "switching modes" depending on the chord. I think this is a bad way to think on one level because it can be quite confusing - after all, E Mix and B Dorian are simply A Major! So really, we're back to , the Key is A - all those chords come from A, so so too should the scale your using as a note resource!

However, on another level, the logic is, if you "play B Dorian" over the Bm chord, you'll be more likely to focus on the notes of the chord, if you were for example to just run the A Major scale in 8th notes over Bm, you'd get A-C#-E-G# on the beats. But if you run B Dorian you'll get B-D-F#-A on the beats.

So there can be a bit of merit to conceptualizing it this way. It's not "totally" wrong, but it is confusing, and often misinterpreted (or the deeper logic is not understood). 

And this is largely true of Jazz - in a lot of pop music, it's more pandiatonic anyway, so you can just wail away on the scale no matter what the chord - as long as you're in the right key.

And there is another thing called "Chord Scale Theory" (or other similar names) where you play X scale over Y chord, in some cases, regardless of the key or mode. So, for example, if Jazz players extend a IMaj7 chord, they'll often add a #11 rather than the "Ionian" 11th. This makes it Lydian. So your chord, in A Major, would have been AMaj11 and you could have played A Major over it. But, if the chord is extended as AMaj7(#11), then A Lydian would be the scale of choice. Or, even if the 11th is not present in the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, a player might want to imply that or "impart that flavor" to it by playing Lydian.

So typically, Chord Scale approach is not simply just "play the rotation of the mode over the chord in the key" such as 2 Dorian over the ii, and 5 Mixolydian over the 5, but it's more involved than that, often using scales that at first don't seem to make sense.

For example, you could play, over the E7 in the key of A, an F Melodic Minor scale.

This seems really weird at first but what this does is limit the notes to a specific set of chord tones and extensions. The E is in the scale, as is the G# (Ab) and the D - so 1-3-b7 are all represented. Then the F and G represent b9 and #9, and the Bb and C represent b5 and #5, so you've got all the possible alterations of an "Alt" chord - so you turn this basic E7 into an "E7alt" type sound by playing this scale over it.

Blues throws another monkey wrench into the works because we often play what is basically Mixolydian in an otherwise major context, or we might do what equates to Dorian - So A Mix in A gives you the b7 blue note, and A Dorian gives you both the b3 and b7 blue note. This is why you sometimes see people say "Play Am Pentatonic over an A blues" and people are like - wait, it's A MAJOR, why would you play A MINOR pentatonic? Short answer - to get blue notes!

So jazzier blues can use modes like this too.

So which you choose to use really depends on what "flavor" you want or what the context might call for.

But on a basic level - you play the scale for the key the song is in, or the mode for the mode the song is in.

But, if you want a jazzier sound or are playing jazz, it's common to use modes that create altered extensions. Also, it's not uncommon to "focus" your note set on chord tones by "thinking" of different modes for each chord, even though really you're playing the scale of the key of the song.

And finally, modes/scales can be used to restrict note choices to produced desired results so you play something you're already familiar with, but it produces a different sound than just playing the scale of the key of the song.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Phew, EVH really is a very distinctive voice amongst guitarists.

There is a lot of info about him online of course. He did do some "pattern playing" which is where he would take 1 fingering pattern and play it super fast across all the strings - whether it fit the prevailing key or <b><u>harmony</u></b> or not - and in many cases it didn't.

EVH is kind of known for not necessarily playing in the key all the time or playing to the chord changes (though he certainly did in many instances as well) and it's almost an "unschooled" or "primitive" approach - though it appears to be entirely intentional.

His phrasing is also very singular - again it almost sounds like he doesn't know how to play in time, but he's so good, you know he is.

Eddie also had a lot of "tricks" as well - and all of of them are in evidence in the Beat It solo.

I don't know that it's the best one to look at how a guitar solo is held together by <b><u>harmony</u></b>. In fact, I'd say a lot of EVH solos are held together by their own integrity, in spite of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. And sometimes, they may even dictate the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

There are probably much better examples of how <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and a Solo work together in the VH catalog, but on average, there are probably better players to look to if you're interested in learning this kind of stuff.

Despite blazing runs now and again, Neil Schon from Journey is a great melodic player who has many solos that are very "singable" and easy to get into your ear and thus easier to learn and analyze. Something like "Stone in Love" which is in G Major but features a prominent Eb, and he really nails it on that chord. But he's also mixing it in producing an interesting scale - but essentially G Minor that resolves to G Major, which has a distinctive sound. So there's a case where the solo is really held together by the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. But there are a lot of great examples with him.

Schon started his career in Santana's band, and you can hear a little bit of the same kind of playing in Carlos Santana's playing - a lot of melodic stuff, though he can be more "riffy" and the chord progressions can just be more basic bluesy vamps and so on.

Another great guitarist worth studying is David Gilmour from Pink Floyd. While he tends to do more of a Penatonic Blues kind of riffing, he does often follow the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and again he's more melodic, and easier to follow because of that. "Comfortably Numb" is a great example because the first solo is in D Major (the relative major to the main key of Bm) and shifts down as the chords do. Then the end solo is a different approach - more pentatatonic and minor riffing and not so much following the chords, but still really melodic.

He always says Hank Marvin of The Shadows was a huge influence and IMHO Marvin is worth digging into if you're really interested. The Shadows was an instrumental band in the UK - probably their most famous hit in the US was "Apache" - I'm sure you've heard it. They were an early 60s instrumental guitar band, much like The Ventures in the US (whose biggest hit is probably "Walk Don't Run" and their version of "Hawaii 5-0") but did more what might be associated with British "Spy" genre stuff - a lot of what sounds like Peter Gunn, James Bond, and Secret Agent Man, etc. They're probably better known in the UK as I believe they did the theme for the famous Thunderbirds TV show and had more hits like "Wonderful Land" and "FBI" etc.

At any rate, I always encourage guitarists who are interested in "melodic playing" to listen to Surf/Spy instrumental guitar music, especially The Shadows and The Ventures. It's not really difficult stuff, but they're really well-written melodies that really follow the changes pretty well, so they make great study pieces. Unfortunately, most people see it as old-fashioned, out of date, irrelevant, and so on. But I still hear shades of their playing (and Link Wray, and Duane Eddy) in a LOT of stuff today.

EVH was more of a "shredder" and less of a "melodist" and there's a little more of a break there - it is just playing scales and arpeggios, but really fast! And again, in EVH's case, his own unique approach means there are other things that dictate what notes he plays rather than scale or key - he may just play a particular note because he can get a pinch harmonic from it, or because it's easy to bed on that string, and so on.

One great EVH solo that follows the changes a lot more than many of the more shreddy ones is from "Hang 'em High" from the much derided Diver Down LP. One of my colleagues always says that the original tunes on Diver Down are the best VH ever did - and the covers on it, the worst!

But I guess what you should take from this is there is a broad range of approaches guitarists used in writing solos. Sometimes, they do things despite the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, sometimes they follow the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, sometimes they just run scales or are riffing, and sometimes the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is bent to fit the solo. Listen to most of the stuff by Randy Rhoads who played for Ozzy Osborne on Diary of a Madman and Blizzard of Ozz. In many songs, the solos or solo sections are their own compositions and may even have their own chord progressions separate from the rest of the song. "Crazy Train" is a great example. But that was more his style - so you hear less "bluesy riffing" over a blues backing from RR, and more "composed out" solos and solo sections. "Mr Crowley", "Goodbye to Romance" they're just all really good.

But you know there are so many great players out there so it's hard to mention just a few, but when speaking of how <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody in guitar solos is tied together, those are kind of the first people that come to mind - and it helps because it's non-shreddy enough and rhythmically phrased enough to really hear and understand what's going on.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you want to write Impressionist music, you need to immerse yourself into impressionist music. Listen to, learn to play, and analyze as much as you possibly do. Then begin trying to recreate it, using music of existing composers as a model.

Diminished chords are not really a bit part of Impressionist style.

7ths are, but focus is on Minor 7ths and 9ths, and Major 7ths and 9ths. Dominant 9ths might be considered the "go to" <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but you will often hear half-diminished 7ths which play the role of the upper part of a 9th chord.

It's important that they're unresolved as well.

Parallelism or "Planing" is commonplace, as is Modal scalar resources and other "open" sounding harmonies.

But it's really more about HOW the materials are played - often rhythmically "blurry" and to some degree tonally "blurry" as well.

We used to have an old (corny) joke years ago when Impressionism was still closer to the present at that time that you just held down the damper (sustain) pedal on the piano and let all the notes run together and you had Impressionism.

And really, while an oversimplification, that's not completely untrue.

That's the kind of stuff you need to pick up by listening - it's not on the theory end of things.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The idea of reading more challenging pieces is a good one always, but at this stage in the game the returns probably aren't going to be as noticeable as you'd like. Still, it's absolutely worth a try.

The other thing that really helps is not only being able to read ahead, but to be able to predict what's coming. You've just played a V7, so a I or vi is coming most likely. While you're on the V, that's where you brain should already be going. So even if your eyes fool you, your brain may still enable you to play the right chord, and sometimes, even if you don't get the right voicing, it's better to play the correct <b><u>harmony</u></b> rather than something completely wrong, or nothing at all, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Another common one is to include the 4, but not the 7.

This is all over The Allman Brothers recordings as well as many other Southern Rock bands who were influenced by them (38. Special for example).

It is a "Hexatonic" scale.

FWIW, I think there's a lot of confusion around "scalar subsets".

"the pentatonic scale" we so often hear about is not "really" a scale per se, but a SUBSET of a scale. It's almost always used in that way.

IOW, rarely are BOTH the melodies and harmonies derived from the notes of the pentatonic scale. Instead, it is used as a melodic resource that LIMITS the amount of notes you play (gets rid of that pesky tritone for example) but the <b><u>harmony</u></b> it's typically used over is still diatonic.

So, playing C Major Pentatonic over chords from C Major is still in C Major. You're simply avoiding the 4 and 7 in the melody by using a particular subset of the entire major scale we call "Pentatonic Major" for example.

Now, obviously, there are plenty of exceptions, but generally speaking, if you were playing over a C Major chord progression that uses the Diatonic set (Major scale) and played only 6 out of the 7 notes, you're not really doing anything "special" besides leaving out 1 note - the 4, or the 7.

One thing that's fun to try is to leave the Tonic off the scale and play everything but the 1! It creates this sort of unresolved tension that can be fun to play around with.

I do wish we had some names for Hexatonic sets.

There are also other cool Pentatonic sets - like modal ones, that I wish more people explored.

C-D-E-G-Bb is kind of "Mixolydian Pentatonic". Or it could be called "Dominant 9th" Pentatonic for example.

So a hexatonic scale that was C-D-E-G-A-B is sort of "CMaj13 Hexatonic" but you know those names get kind of unwieldy - because does 13 imply the 11 and 9 or not?

And speaking of restrictive - just to put something out there for readers, always remember that most people don't just use 1 scale. If you listen to really good players and really well written music, excepting any where limitations like that are used intentionally for a constructive principle, most of them will shift between Major, Pent Major, Hexatonic, and so on (also excepting any kinds of blues stuff becuase that adds another dimension).

But this is what doing something like playing Em Pent or G Pent over a C Major progression does - it limits the notes to a different subset (which would include the 7 of the key in this case) which imparts a different flavor.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; I believe that they key element in all deceptive cadences is that the melody ends on the tonic; it's the supporting <b><u>harmony</u></b> that's 'deceptive.' 

Though the V - vii^o7 would go against that.

Are you sure that wasn't a form of Half Cadence?

Certainly, in the cases of V - VI, or IV, or even I, the tonic is present in the 2nd chord.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;  I think it's the absence of the C#&gt;D move that's the problem for the "deceptive resolution of secondary dominant" idea - yes? (Maybe if it had gone to G or Gm? Or Bm or Bb?)

Yeah, I think so. And that's what u/theoriemeister is essentially saying.

I don't know that I've ever seen it specifically stated that a Deceptive Cadence must have the Tonic in the 2nd chord, but certainly V-VI and V-IV forms do. And what then separates the from our normal V-I is of course the "wrong" <b><u>harmony</u></b> where the I should have been - but it still includes scale degree 1 for some sense of resolution still.

(and yeah, we'd be looking for G, Gm (1st inversion traditionally) or Bb or Bm typically).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Phew.

"Leading Tone" is generally used to refer to the 7th note of a Major scale, or the Raised 7th notes of a Minor scale. It, by virtue of being a half step below the Tonic note, "leads to" the Tonic, hence the name.

It is not necessarily however, a type of "Non-Chord Tone", which is what a Passing Tone is.

A "Passing Tone" is a Non-Chord Tone that "passes between" two chord tones. For example, within the context of a C Major chord, an F note, passing from E to G, or G to E, would be a "passing note".

Non-Chord Tones are dependent on CHORDS, so you can't tell if ANY note is a chord tone or not, and thus whether it's passing or not, until you have <b><u>harmony</u></b> to judge it against.

Likewise, a Leading Tone is dependent on the KEY, so you can't tell if ANY note is a Leading Tone or not, until you place it in the context of a Key (though a Scale would imply a key in some contexts).

A Pentatonic Scale, with the two diatonic notes that are not already in the Pentatonic scale added, is just a Major or Minor scale, depending on which Pentatonic scale you started with.

C-D-E-G-A + the two missing notes, F and B, is simply C Major.

A-C-D-E-G + the two missing notes B and F, is simply A Minor.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"Ascending progressions":

G - A

E - E

C - C

I - vi, or, root movement down a 3rd.

G - A

E - F

C - C

I - IV, or, root movement up a 4th  (read, ii-V-I)

G - A

E - F

C - D 

I - ii, or root movement up a 2nd.

These are, "progressing" progressions - what end up as being "functional" progressions.

Other successions are retrogressions, or non-functional, or "descending" - BTW ascending and descending is not to be taken literally here, it just categorizes the chords by whether any of the notes ascend by step, or descend by step, to produce a different <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

In functional music, composers show a preference for "ascending" progressions - Root Movement of a 4th Up, a 2nd Up, or a 3rd Down.

I - vi - IV - V - I - 3rd down, 3rd down, 2nd up, 4th up.

Have you ever heard people say "V shouldn't go to IV" - you hear it all the time in theory classes.

Why? Well, because composers didn't do it regularly. But it is a "descending" progression, and we don't see a preference for those in Functional, Tonal music (interestingly, there is more of an equal distribution of ascending and descending in pre-Tonal music).

Rock music often prefers "retrogressions" that go the "wrong way", or what are essentially descending progressions (though there are still plenty of ascending progressions). It is, like pre-tonal music, a little more evenly distributed among the two, which maybe a slight preference for descending progressions.

Seen this chart?:

https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://globalguitarnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Chord-Motion_Major-Key.png&amp;imgrefurl=http://globalguitarnetwork.com/chord-progressions-major-key/&amp;h=299&amp;w=614&amp;tbnid=feNz1wQE5tft5M:&amp;tbnh=106&amp;tbnw=217&amp;usg=__T1jyqkcrh4Wy3GvW6VAcHTiRzbs%3D&amp;vet=10ahUKEwiYhtylz4XbAhXpnuAKHW89BoYQ9QEILTAA..i&amp;docid=1sSl3pyk_gEQvM&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYhtylz4XbAhXpnuAKHW89BoYQ9QEILTAA

Across is "up a 4th" - iii - vi - ii - V - I

IV to ii within the same category - guess what? - "down a 3rd".

IV - V - up a 2nd.

ii - vii - down a 3rd.

IV - vii - up a 4th.

vii - I - up a 2nd.

Notice the arrow that goes from the V back to vi? That's up a 2nd.

And the one from iii - IV - up a 2nd.

It's up a 2nd, down a 3rd, and up a 4th. That's functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

IV - I is the only oddball - the Plagal cadence. You know where that comes from? Pre-tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> where there was more even preference for ascending and descending progressions. But in CPP Tonality, the preference is vastly (at least in functional terms) in favor of ascending progressions. And many people consider the I chord to be able to go anywhere so they don't always count it as part of every functional progression.
__________________

Secondary consideration. Let's take a chord with a dissonant 7th and resolve the 7th down by step (as happens in tonal music).

Thus, in the key of C, the F note would have to go to E.

That means, V7 - I, V7 - vi, or V7 - iii. Do you know what those are? Up a 4th, up a 2nd, and down a 3rd.

Now we don't use ALL of the possibilities all of the time, because that darn Leading Tone throws a monkey wrench in the works, so we're less likely to resolve V7 or vii^o7 in ways that don't include the leading tone in the resulting chords.

But iii could resolve to I, vi, or IV (see the chart?). That's all of them.

vi will sometimes go to vii, so vi to ii, vi to IV and vi to vii. That's all of them.

IV goes to ii, V, or vii. That's all of them.

It's sort of only when the LT becomes involved that it reduces the results - V to I or vi, and vii to I or in a sequence, iii (though it can also move to V, so there you go).

Authentic Cadences, Up a 4th.

Deceptive Cadences, up a 2nd.

(we don't have a name for the other one for cadences because they weren't used "cadentially").

Notice also that the "further out" on the chart from the tonic you are, the more options you have, but as you get "tonally closer" to your goal, there are fewer options, with all roads leading to I so to speak.

That's how tonal music works. And it all comes from voice-leading, and a preference for certain moves that evolved over time.

"Circle of 5ths progressions" are remnants of that. "7 resolving to 3 of the next chord" - remnant of that.

This explains all the common moves, secondary dominant resolutions, and so on. It's just something people never seem to learn but it's at the heart of all of it.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>All of your uses are the "standard" places to encounter it, which is why it "sounds good to your ears".

Melodic Minor makes a #vim7b5 on that degree.

It can work as a secondary chord to any major chord. For example, Dm7b5 - Eb in the key of anything that has an Eb chord in it besides the key of Eb :-) would be a "dominant in major" function on the secondary level. The same could applied to the others you mention.

Another common one we hear is less as a m7b5 and more as a m6 chord (an inversion) which is like ivm6 (which is iim7b5 inverted) to I - the so-called "Hollywood Cadence" - so it's acting as Predominant but in a Plagal fashion, resolving directly to I.

The French composers were especially fond of it and it's relationship to a Dominant 9th chord (it's like a "rootless" V9) which they used as a coloristic resource and ran in parallel on any scale degree. Jazz players use it as a "color" chord similarly sometimes.

It's also used as a "chromatic connector" in Jazz, such as between Em7 and Dm7 - and Ebm7b5 "connects" the two chords with some chromatic voice-leading - such moves keep the A (Bbb) note constant between the Ebm7b5 and Dm7 chords.

Ascending, that move is like a secondary m7b5 resolving to a m chord, which seems odd, but it's again like a rootless V9 just resolving to minor. But it's more often seen in the descending version, making it sort of "backwards" but the chromatic movement seems more of a "slide down".

So whether it's a "real" chord or apparent chord (just a bunch of passing notes that happen to make some chord) depends on your view.

That brings up the also common appearance in "line cliche" or "Chromatic Embellishiment of a Static <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" lines, like the "Chim Chim Cheree" thing, which is - Cm - Cm/B - Cm/Bb - Cm/A which are super common moves in Jazz and Pop - so it's more a "result" of the bass movement, and maybe not as much of a chord on it's own right, but we would still use Am7b5 for the symbol in some cases.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Let's maybe take a different approach on this:

The **traditional** Keys of C Major and A Minor do **NOT** have the same notes.

Instead, in Am, the 7th scale degree is altered at harmonically important junctures (cadences) to form a Dominant V or vii^o chord, either of which includes the Leading Tone.

Focus, prominence, or recurrence are "circumstantial evidence". 

The "smoking gun" are cadences that functionally point to C or Am.

We could say, Minor key pieces "focus on" a set of chords that are different from Major key pieces.

For example, C, G7, dm, and F will be the "most important" chords in the key of C Major.

But in Am, the "most important" chords will be Am, E7, B^o, and Dm.

They do share chords, but the way the chords are used - Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - is what distinguishes the two.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You said "Rock", so a couple of comments will address that.

 Firstly, "Western <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" has little to do with Rock.

Secondly when we say "rhythm part" we don't mean an individual melodic line like a voice part. The "rhythm part" is what the "rhythm guitar" plays - whether it be single notes or chords. That's why no one addresses it the way you want - "part" in that context simply means "what that instrument plays".

Thirdly, Rock players don't read charts.

Let me come back to all this though and hit this now:

&gt;is <b><u>harmony</u></b> in Western music by definition chord-based?

Of course. That's what "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" means. Chords are <b><u>harmony</u></b>. <b><u>Harmony</u></b> involves multiple notes sounding together, which produce chords.

&gt;what are the absolute most basic building blocks of Western music?

To say it as it's often said in elementary schools, "Melody, Rhythm, and <b><u>Harmony</u></b>".

That's not a perfect definition, but it's actually pretty accurate.

Almost all music now - including rock music - is "homophonic" but no one outside of academia calls it that. It's "Melody with accompaniment". Melody, supported by chords.

Now, back to Rock - it sounds like you're spending too much time worrying about definitions and reading things rather than learning to play actual music.

Strum the chords, and sing the melody. You know how "the basics" of Rock music.

Something like "Wake Me Up, When September Ends" or "Time of Your Life", both by Green Day, consist of two "parts" initially. There's the Guitar Part, which is chords, and the Vocal Part, which is the melody he sings.

That's really all there is to it.

You really need to learn to play some songs either like this, or similar to it. There are of course exceptions, and there can be more complex ideas, but that is it - melody, chords, played in rhythm.

Now there are specifics, such as keys and tuning and instrument choice and so on, but again that stuff is really irrelevant if you just learn to play the songs. They're really self explanatory.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Just a heads up: When almost all jazz players say "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" or when you look it up online, what you're going to encounter mostly is not "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" per se, but quartal *voicings* of tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> which are two different things. The examples u/south87 gave are some great examples of "real" (for lack of a better term) Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You've stumbled on Mode Mixture - which everyone does (one of the most asked questions here) but doesn't know what it's called!

Also, it freaks people out because since they haven't learned about it, but it "sounds good", they're like "why does this work?"

But it's just super common and just as much a part of the system as plain old Major and Minor - in fact, in modern popular music it's really widespread.

So widespread in fact that in many cases saying a song is "in A Minor" or "in A Major" makes less sense than just saying "it's in A" (which is a concept called Centric music or Centricity, but even fewer people know about that).

Your piece could very well begin in A Major, but the Em and G7 chords are just borrowed chords. Borrowed chords are those that are used in the Parallel Minor - so in this case, A minor. Both Em and G7 are chords "from" A Minor, being used in an otherwise A Major context.

Depending on what other musical elements are happening, it could be in A Minor, but with the A and A Major 7 chords being borrowed from the Parallel Major (A Major).

So essentially, you're mixing chords from both the Major and Minor modes of A - "mode mixture".

Modern musicians also conceptualize this even further by considering chords that come from other parallel modes (A Phrygian, etc.) as being mode mixture too, but more often called "Modal Interchange" especially in Jazz circles.

The chorus does the same basic thing - it's "in A", using the bVI, bVII, bIII and I chords - again it could be A Minor, and the Major A chord is borrowed, or it could be A Major and the three chords from A Minor - C, F and G, are being borrowed.

Super super super super common.

So there's not really a "modulation" per se as what you have is going to pretty strongly sound like it's all Centered on A (though the melody and any other elements should be considered).

In Common Practice Period <b><u>harmony</u></b>/theory we don't consider the change from A Major to A Minor or vice versa to be a "modulation" or "key change" because the TONIC has not changed. It's merely a "change of mode".

In order for it to modulate (change key) a new Tonic has to be established (whether the key sig changes or not, so C Major to A minor is a key change).

It can be six one way half dozen the other WRT whether you consider a progression like yours Major with minor borrowings, minor with Major borrowings, or just Centered on A. Unless there's specific things that point to one or the other, we're usually content saying it's just "in A". If there are far more minor mode chords and only a major mode chord here or there, we'd probably say "A Minor", or if the melodic elements or bass line etc. really point towards one or the other we'd probably pick that one.

For yours, since it begins each pass on A Major, and seems to cadence the chorus on A as well, I'd probably say it's Major with borrowed chords from the parallel mode but it's pretty evenly balanced otherwise (without additional information). Or you know, we could say the Verse is maybe more strongly Major with minor borrowings and the chorus more minor with a major borrowing, but by then you might as well write out the actual chords!

But it's all really common - in "X Key" it's common to use Mode Mixture, which is borrowing chords from the "Parallel X" key.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>That's pretty accurate.

The vibrations are not like waves, they ARE waves :-)

It it's Aperiodic, it's Noise, if it's Periodic, it produces a definable pitch.

Tone and pitch (and even "note" when used in that context) are generally synonymous but we usually say pitch when dealing with specific musical notes. So we might say that a 110 Frequency tone has a pitch of A.

Yes, higher frequency = higher pitch and shorter wavelength.

We would usually say, 110 and 220 are the same "pitch" such as "an A" but they are actually different "notes".

Since we have 8 letter names in the musical scale, we say they are an Octave higher. So if you double the frequency, the pitch increases an octave. If you half the frequency, the pitch decreases an octave.

They are similar in physics - well, this is actually physics we're talking about here - the physics of sound, or acoustics.

So a 200 Hz wave completes 2 cycles in the time (and distance) a 100 Hz wave does.

The 200 Hz wave also sounds "twice as high" - "same note", but twice as high.

Your last part seems to be doing something different.

There is the Harmonic Series, where each interval is a whole number multiple of the base frequency, called the fundamental.

If your fundamental (f) is 100, then the Harmonic Series for that would be 200, 300, 400, 500 etc. Or (f), 2(f), 3(f)....n(f)

Pythagorean Tuning takes only the 3:2 ratio and builds the remaining intervals from that, however in doing so there is some amount "left over" (Pythagorean Comma).

Because of this, an adjustment has to made somewhere, or across the set of notes to "eat up the leftovers".

You can see the ratios here that result in building from the 3:2 interval and then adjusting to compensate for the leftovers.

http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/<b><u>harmony</u></b>/pyth2.html

This explains it in more detail:

http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/<b><u>harmony</u></b>/pyth4.html


FWIW, these are not the "very basics of music". They are the very basics of *sound*. Music is something else.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;In particular, would it be wrong to describe key signatures as essentially the "set of frequencies whose harmonic series are most pronounced" in the associated audio wave?

Yes

&gt;Am I touching on anything real here or is this the wrong idea?

Wrong idea.

"He was a good boy, and truly a man's best friend, and I will miss him dearly."

What am I talking about?

I hope you guessed "a dog".

That's what the Tonic is like. And to some degree, what Tonality is like. You don't even have to hear the Tonic in order to establish a Tonality.

The Tonic is "implied" by the relationship of the other notes to it as well as musical emphasis.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> is actually not even necessary, but it enhances it.

For example, I could have just said "He was good boy" and you might have thought Dog.

But "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" is more like "and truly man's best friend and I will miss him dearly". Now we're even more sure it's a Dog and most likely, the dog has passed away - there's still some slight doubt that he may just have had to be given away because they couldn't keep him anymore - and music can do that to - a Tonality, or Tonal Center, or Tonic can be "hinted at", it can be "pretty darn clear" or be "totally obvious" and even if we like, "ambiguous".

This has nothing to do with anything more than the notes being used, and when and how they're used - what order they come in and so on.

For example, the same exact words can mean different things:

Is your room clean?

Your room is clean.

The same exact set of notes, or chords, can mean different  things.

A chord progression of:

Em - C - G - D means Em 

while

G - D - Em - C means G Major (both of these are extremely abstracted examples, but their use in music does typically correspond to these keys).

Keys are about MUSICAL EMPHASIS (i.e. what the tonic is). Then as a secondary aspect, the relationship of each note (or chord, etc.) to the emphasized (or implied) Tonic tells you additional information about the Key (i.e. whether it's major or minor).

Think about a Key like the "main character" or on a simpler level, the "Subject" in a grammatical phrase.

In the progressions above, the relationship of the chords and the notes that make them point to two possible keys, and actually 5 additional modes.

However, with Em - C - G - D - which we'll assume here continues in a looping progression, the musical emphasis is (typically) on the first chord each time the loop repeats (it's the point where we know it repeats - the beginning of the cycle) so this "orients" our thinking that E (and the Em <b><u>harmony</u></b>) is the "Central Note" - or "Tonic".

Then, the relationship of the other notes (chords) to E (Em) tells us that this is "Has an E Tonic, and is in the Minor Mode".

Thus we say it's "in the Key of E Minor".

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>u_MusicTheoryLover</b><br>I'm not sure if your mention of a disability in math is meant to say that this causes you issues in theory.

It's a myth also that theory is highly math related. It's only basic math for most of it. And it's not even present in a lot of it.

You shouldn't be so down on yourself and I'd caution you against "blaming" others for what you see as your shortcomings.

Because, they actually probably did the right thing, and the thing you see as a shortcoming is not a shortcoming at all.

I work with world class musicians the likes of Joshua Bell, Jon Nakamatsu, and Nadia Solerno-Sonnenberg to name a few.

I've had chances to chat with them and bring up some theory things and they generally don't know it.

What they know is what they need to do what they do. If it's Chanticleer, well, yes, they of course know a lot more about Tuning the ensemble than someone like Nakamatsu does, because he's playing piano with fixed tuning and that's not really necessary for him. And John Abercrombie knew a whole lot more about Theory than Nadia Solerno-Sonnenberg - because he's playing Jazz and Improvising.

None - NONE of the vocal faculty at my school also teach Theory. They don't know it that well. They have what they got in undergrad work and that's it - much of which is often forgotten - just like those world class artists.

But you ask them about Vocal Technique, and Diction, and things like that - man they know their stuff.

Not knowing theory is not really a limitation for what you want to do. I mean, you have to be able to read notes, and it would absolutely be useful to know enough about <b><u>harmony</u></b> to know you're singing the 3rd of a chord, and so on, but if your goal is to perform Opera, Lieder, and Musical Theater, then you need to go take lessons from someone who does those things professionally and forget learning theory.

That stuff can be taught privately, but if you really want to do that as a career for example, you need to go get a Music Degree in Vocal Performance at an institution that covers those areas.

I know our Vocal performance majors do all of those things, and we have had numbers of winners of various state and national competitions and some go on to work for Opera companies across the country.

They all took 4 semesters of theory just like all the other music majors. Half of them probably scraped by with a C.

They don't really need to know how to part-write a German Augmented Sixth chord. They need to be able to sing in German.

If you want to learn more about theory, by all means, do so - the more the merrier when it comes to theory subs like this.

But really, you should be on an Opera, or Vocal sub, and not a theory one if those are the things you want to do.

To go back to your other point - when a Trumpet player comes to use seeking a Performance Major degree, they usually know ZERO theory besides basic music reading skills. That is not a handicap, that is the way it is.

And I sit in auditions a number of times per year. Many players who get into the program can't play scales all that well. Their pieces are often great (and what gets them in) but their scales suck. 

Usually, a person who plays scales poorly plays their instrument poorly as well, but sometimes they play scales poorly and play the instrument well - and the pieces they chose to perform are played well. So it's not always a 1:1 correlation.

And even the players who play their scales and pieces well usually know very little theory at all.

In a sense, we do teach them enough to get them to the next level, but that also comes with rigorous study on the instrument and ensemble performances.

But "undergraduate theory" is all that is required, and they all just take what they need from it (and forget a lot!) and keep moving on from there.

Good luck with your future endeavors.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There is no naming convention for Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

One could, if necessary, use traditional tertian names to imply Quartal **voicings** as is often done in Jazz.

Csus2, Csus4, C7sus4 - all can imply a quartal voicing/chords

I agree with Jon - we could probably use figured bass to do it easily (well, we actually already can) with a bit of modification, but no one does it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There's really no such thing a "theoretically correct".

Don't worry about if things are "correct according to theory" or not.

What you should do is simply listen to music and see if it does any of these things. That at least tells you how common or out of the ordinary it is.

It's actually quite common - not only in terms of voices (or parts) but terms of instruments coming in, or different sounds coming in, and so on.

For voices specifically, you could listen to The Beatles and you'll hear all kinds of combinations like what you're talking about. They constantly add in and drop out harmonies, and they'll also have the <b><u>harmony</u></b> drop out to take over backing "oohs" and stuff like that.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think you're maybe misunderstanding what they mean.

They don't really (or shouldn't) speak of them as "separate aspects" but more as "elements that make up" most of the music we listen to.

But all Gregorian Chant does not have <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. We could argue a drum solo doesn't have "pitch" beyond highness or lowness and certainly doesn't have <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Whether someone sees "Clapping Music" as "real" music is a separate issue, but if it is, it doesn't really have any pitch or <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

So they are separate elements in that regard - but yes the traditional definition of melody is that it has as least pitch and rhythm, and is a "cohesive unit". Since the advent of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, most melodies are either conceived of within a harmonic framework, imply specific harmonies intentionally, or are readily harmonizeable using conventional <b><u>harmony</u></b> - so in that sense they're inseperable.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes, but because you can "extract" the rhythm from one melody an apply it to another (Isorhythm) they can be *treated as* independent elements.

Some people would also argue that start and stop times do not necessarily constitute "rhythm" in the way we usually mean it - for example, a "Prelude sans Mesure" of course "has rhythm" in that the notes appear in succession, in time, but they are not "in a meter".

To take that to an extreme, does "Music on a Long Thin Wire" have Rhythm? (or <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, or Melody for that matter - then we can argue if it's even music or not though of course).

To put this in perspective, Solo works for unpitched percussion doesn't have "melody" or "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" in any traditional sense - but from an extreme standpoint, there is "highness and lowness" to various drums which you could argue is "pitch" and thus capable of producing melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

But do we go to that extreme?

Likewise, most Gregorian Chant "has rhythm" but in essence, a string of "non metered" durations would be considered an extreme view of rhythm or at least not what most people mean when talking about the original "basic" definition in the OP.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Google "Shell Voicings" and you'll get tons of info.

It all depends on what kind of sound they want, but in Jazz, as a general rule, the most important notes are:

The 3rd of the chord - this tells whether the chord is Major or Minor.

The 7th of the chord - the 7th chord is the "basic harmonic unit" of Jazz music. But having the 7th present tells you what kind of 7th chord it is (important because it is the base unit).

A "shell" voicing can be just those two notes. They carry enough information with them (assuming other players are playing other notes) for someone who's accompanying to outline/imply the <b><u>harmony</u></b> without needing tons of notes.

The next most important notes are any 9th, 11th, and/or 13th chord extensions - so, IOW, if you want a 13th chord, you only need the 3rd, 7th, and 13th and that's it.

Also important are any alterations - if you notice all of the chords above don't have the 5th in them. But if the 5th is altered, then it's important to have it in there. So a C7#5 is going to have E, G#, and Bb present where C7 could get by with just E and Bb.

Now, all of this assumes that the Root of the chord is either taken by the Bass Player, or another instrument, or maybe just the LH of the Piano, or, if the chord is inverted, it's played up higher in the texture, or, the root is heavily implied by the context.

If not, the player will likely opt to include the Root as the most important note, but at least an important note.

C-E-Bb would be C7 if you felt the need to include the Root.

Notice again the G (the 5th) is the least necessary note (because it's not altered here, but if it is, it would be present).

But the real answer to your question is to study some transcriptions of the music and see exactly what they do. It's all about sound, but there are common practices - IOW most people just don't bang out block chords for every chord change.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hmmm, these are kind of tough questions to answer - because really it's just about more experience doing these things -  it's "a picture is worth a thousand words" kind of thing. IOW, explaining the difference between Major and Minor is like talking about the difference between a Biscuit and a Dinner Roll - they're made of the same basic ingredients but until you see and taste them the descriptions sound similar enough that it's hard to tell the difference.

One way to tell a Key is "pitch exclusivity" - all the notes are from B Major, so it's probably B Major.

However, another, bigger factor is which chord sounds like "home". Since this starts on a B, and the end of the two phrases are essentially F# chords, it points much more to the key of B as the home chord. As a sometimes simple thing, you can simply tack on either a B chord or a G#m chord (which would be the minor key these notes represent) at the end and see which one sounds "more conclusive" and that can help you tell - but that's not 100% because it can sound "right" but maybe not definitive.

IOW, determining the key involves a whole bunch of evidence, not just one thing.

Your 2nd chord IS D#m in 2nd inversion because it has only the notes of the D#m chord in it.

It can't be (or we don't infer that it is) B because there is no B.

Some notes can be dropped to no ill effect, but others can't - and the Root is the most important note. If you drop it, you can't tell what chord it is! Or, rather, it's something else.

Right for most, except the chord in your 5th measure - the C# and E make the F# sound like it's an F#7 chord. Therefore the B and D# notes sound "wrong" there. Or, the C# and E are "wrong" and it's a B chord.

Part of the issue here is what I'm getting at above - it is SO SO SO common to hear either a I or V chord in this location that we EXPECT to hear one or the other. By giving us the F#, C#, and E, that's enough aural information for us to assume our expectations of an F#7 here is accurate, despite the missing A#. When the B and D# come in it's like "wait, what?". They'll sound "odd" to most people.

The Final chord is just another inverted F# chord.

I think you might be a little stuck on the Left Hand - you're seeing the "shapes" you're playing as broken chords as the chord, but the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is always based on everything sounding at once, barring any so-called "non-chord-tones".

So like in m.5 - even though that's a broken B arpeggio in the LH, and that might be seen as "the chord for the measure", the RH disagrees with that - and it does so in a way that doesn't make them traditional non-chord-tones and it makes something sound amiss.

So that C#-A#-C# in the LH is still PART OF what's happening in the RH, which is F# and C# - which gives you a complete F# chord.

It is common to drop notes from chords, but usually the 5th of the chord is the least important note and the first one to go. It's not uncommon to drop the 3rd but you could go through entire pieces and maybe 10s of pieces and never find one. Dropping hte 3rd and the 5th in a 7th chord happens regularly as well. When you have 2 or 3 part counterpoint, some notes have to be omitted so composers use context to imply chords.


If you were to raise this all a half step, or 5 half steps, or whatever, it changes nothing.

If a person had never heard it before, they'd just assume it's the way it is.

If they had heard it a number of times, some people will go "that seems kind of high" - but that's if they've heard it enough times to get used to it.

Only people with perfect pitch who already knew the original would notice it was different. And even for them it doesn't matter, it's just different.

Now, on some instruments it might make a difference - playing in A on guitar would allow the use of more open strings, so a piece like this might sound "fuller" in A than in B on a guitar, but those are the only kind of instances where transposition really affects anything.

You say there was no <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Yes, there was <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

It is created linearly (horizontally) and not conceptualized vertically as you say (though we do consider vertical consonances).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's in the name :-)

Here's something for you:

In pieces of classical music, the piece will often end with a "thing" that consists of 3 roots, and a 3rd.

So it only has 2 *different* notes.

Is it a "chord".

We certainly hear it and treat it that way (and that's really what's important).

It's because these collections of notes IMPLY <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Maybe if you want to get pedantic about it, it's maybe not a "chord", but it does imply one!

Also, let's take this to the opposite extreme - is C C# D D# E F G G# A A# B when all played together a chord?

What about C C# D - is that a chord?

Here's what I would say: if you're playing power chords and making music or more importantly making money doing so, if someone wants to argue whether they're chords or not, walk away. You've got a gig to get to and don't have time for that BS. Or, if pressed, you can call them "money chords" ;-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Because of historical evolution. Music evolved using a Tertian-based <b><u>harmony</u></b>, which is "3rds" or "every other note".

They just didn't build chords this way, at least, not until the 20th century.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>As I said, the dichotomy of "tension/relaxation" is fundamental, but what things those concepts are applied to are contextual. Certainly a move from "more complex" to "simpler", or from "busier" to "calmer" and things like that are generally considered forms of resolution (though resolution can also be used like "conclusion").

So a "More complex" harmonic ratio moving to a simpler one could be described as "resolving". But it's not always the case that a "simpler" <b><u>harmony</u></b> is the "relaxed" one - in Jazz, playing a simple triad can sound very awkward and out of place, which in itself can introduce tension/conflict/confusion in the listener, and then that moving to a more complex <b><u>harmony</u></b> can actually sound like the resolution.

It's all relative really.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;There's one part I can't seem to explain with functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Not all music should be explained with functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. There's no crime if something is not functional. It's quite common in fact.

Stop trying to "explain" or "justify" things using theory (or worse, functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>).

It "works" because these are common sounds we've heard many times before, not because of any "theory".

You're basically explaining all the reasons why it "works" - notes that connect to other notes in a logical fashion, "function" be damned!

Start using your ears more, and not your brain :-) Otherwise you'll think yourself into corners and get stuck.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's called a "non chord tone".

It is, if you like, part of the sounding <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but it is not part of the chord, and not analyzed as such.

A G Note within an F chord is going to be some kind of suspension, passing tone, neighbor tone, or so on.

The exception would be in Dominant chords, where, in Beethoven, the Dominant 9th (V9, and V7b9) start to get used a little more frequently. They would be V chords and not I chords though.

If there is a 7th on a I chord, it's going to be Imaj7. A Imaj9 could be possible, but would be pretty rare, and that 9th is more likely to be a non-chord tone - at least, we would eliminate that possibility first before calling it a chord tone.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Can't answer without sing what was given to you as "the style".

For example, if part of the definition of that style was highly imitative practice, your piece is not highly imitative. But if that wasn't a requirement, then your piece is OK.

You do have a Parallel 5th by Contrary Motion at the end of m.4 to the downbeat of m.5 in the Oboe and Piano LH (outer voices, making it all the more noticeable).

That would probably be counted "wrong" from a strict counterpoint standpoint (and it wouldn't hurt to have a 3rd in that chord, so the oboe could have taken the G).

m.8 has a D# in the Piano RH against the D in the LH and in the Cello (or, right after them, which is a cross-relation) which would be frowned upon in classical <b><u>harmony</u></b> and counterpoint.

There are tons of things that are "wrong" from a strict counterpoint standpoint, and there is plenty that is "atypical" for classical style composition, which is what you seem to be going for here.

That doesn't make it "bad" necessarily - we're some 200 years beyond all that stuff.

Take for example, essentially, you're writing in Em, but you don't have the right key signature.

So someone could go through - comparing it to either strict counterpoint, or strict CPP style, and find all kinds of astylistic elements.

However, that may not be the point of the assignment - it may be to help the instructor see how each student approaches and assignment like this and can help them to get a handle on how much each person knows, or how much musical experience they have, or how creative they are, and so on.

But if you've studied a bunch of stuff, sometimes the intent of an assignment like this is not really "write what you want" but "show me you know how to use what we've learned". If you had learned about a bunch of contrapuntal techniques, then I'd say you might have shown some good initiative and creativity here, but didn't do what the assignment really intended.

But again, I'd have to see the instructions (and know the teacher better) to make that kind of assessment.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;The idea: A whole work contains relatively limited similar <b><u>harmony</u></b>. This has the effect of unifying the piece and giving it a clear identity/character/theme.

You're basically describing what makes up the core of music theory.

&gt;I could go on and on with examples, but I figured I’d make this post to get some feedback wether or not this is an idea I should flesh out more and teach with more examples. 

You could, but this work has already been done for you - you could probably find thousands of analyses that deal with this.

I mean, I hate to say it like this, but pretty much, just read anything related to theory and this concept is going to come up. It's why the Common Practice Period is the common practice period. In fact, I dare say, it's kind of a "given" or an "understood", at least among those who've studied theory academically.

Maybe you should start with Schenkerian Analysis and branch out from there?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;  But by that logic, spending any time studying music theory is a wild goose chase, no?

It can be.

If you're making an app though, yeah, obviously you can have specific results.

But, think of it this way:

You're in a Major Key, you get a iii chord. WHere is it likely to Go?

In classical music, the answer is, IV, or vi with a fairly high probability of each.49% for each let's say.

In rock/pop music, it's still going to be the majority probability, but much lower overall. It will be likely to also go to more other places - ii, V, V/ii etc.

In Jazz, it's going to be a different set of probabilities - likely to a o7 or m7b5 chord that connects it with some other chord, such as ii.

In contemporary art music, it may be moot to talk about chords at all, but it could easily go to bii, or v (minor v), i (instead of I) or bv (minor flat 5) or even biii or iv, etc. if a piece still used traditional triadic <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

IOW, function is determined by style.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not usually.

Sometimes they will use formal structures - even sonata form - but often, things like Theme and Variations, etc. but they also develop their own new types of forms (Arch Form for example).

Some also still adhere to the 4 movement layout, though tempi may not be in the same kind of order.

But yes, 20th century (and later Romantic Period) composers broke as many ties with tradition in terms of form/genre as they did with <b><u>harmony</u></b>/melody/rhythm and they became "String Quartets" primarily because of the "weight" of the piece (except for Webern maybe ;-) and the ensemble.

Obviously, Debussy's and Ravel's Quartets are a little more tied to tradition, and those who wrote in a Neo-Classical or Neo-Romantic style brought back more ideas from those earlier periods in one way or another, but certainly other composers pushed the boundaries of the form.

But most are going to be "heavy duty" concert-weight pieces meant to be played by superior musicians - not just a light romp for a common set of instruments used in String 4tets.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>We usually don't consider the 8ve to be "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>".

It's a "doubling" instead.

_________

Tuning of a guitar or bass makes no difference to the SOUNDING CHORDS.

IOW, if Guitar A plays what **sounds as** a C chord, and Guitar B is in a different tuning but plays what **sounds as** a C chord, they're both playing C chords.

The 60s-70s band Credence Clearwater Revival did this all the time. John Fogerty played is guitar tuned down a whole step, while his brother played his in standard tuning.

When John played an E shape, it produced a D chord sound. His brother just played the normal D chord and they were both playing the same chord - this gave them different **voicings** of the same chord.

Any time one guitarist plays with a Capo on, they are essentially "tuning the guitar higher" from the way we think about it, but if they play something that produces an F chord sound, and the other player plays a regular F on a standard tuned guitar, it's going to both be F chords again - just different voicings.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Short answer, yes. Dissonances resolves to consonances.

The primary situation would be like so:

C - B - A

C -  -  D

So the passing tone from C to A produces a dissonant 7th with the lowest voice.

With a 3rd voice:

C - B - A

E - - F

C - - D

This is very typical.

But, when your final chord is ALL perfect intervals, that reduces the number of options and, less common moves - because in most styles that kind of chord (like D-A-D) is going to be a final chord at a cadence.

But a single octave or 5th in a chord of resolution is not uncommon.

G

E

C

or

E

G

C

or

C

E

C

or even

C

A

C

But

C

G

C

or

G

G

C

or things like that tend to be less common within the phrase except at a cadence.

In some ways, you can think of it like this: In 2 part counterpoint, an octave or even 5th in the counterpoint can sound "bare" or "empty" once you're in a style that uses 3rds and 6ths more commonly, and those perfect intervals tend to appear in things like:

E - D - C

C - D - E

where the octave is on a weak part of the beat and is passing through in a "voice exchange" kind of maneuver.

But, when a 3rd part is added, it can kind of "thicken the <b><u>harmony</u></b>" of those rather bare intervals by adding a 3rd or 6th - so there can be one pair of notes that form a perfect interval but usually the other voice is forming a 3rd or 6th with one of those voices.

Because of other types of dissonances - neighbor tones, suspensions, and so on, there could be a number of situations arise where the dissonance resolves to the perfect part of the interval - instead of for example the typical tritone resolving to 3rd or 6th.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I can't get the image for your link, but no Minor is not exactly the same.

There are a few differences.

VII when used, goes to III so it's "added" at the end.

Also, progressions like i - v^6 - iv^6 - V are often mentioned in minor key charts because they are common, and a common use of the non-dominant minor v chord (or "modal dominant" as some call it):

http://www.angelfire.com/music/HarpOn/image/chordprogmin.gif

As others have mentioned, these charts are for CPP functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and not anything after that.

And it should be made clear that even in CPP music, things like the iii chord in major are comparatively rare.

There's a great video by Seth Monahan on YT that talks about - I think he calls it "the big 16" - about 16 chords (some are the same chord, in inversion) that appear commonly in CPP music.

Any other chords can be considered comparatively rare, and used for special circumstances, such as "linear progressions" (like the one with the minor v above) or Sequential progressions.

I should mention too that while others have pointed out and I agree that much music does not follow this "map" after the CPP a lot of it still does so it still can be of use.

The whole "ii-V-I" mantra of Jazz is based on this, as are progressions like vi - ii - V - I and "doo wop" progressions like I - vi - IV (or ii) - V (Mozart even has one of those!).

So the principles here can still be useful and since it is so common, yes, music will sound "correct" when following this map, but there's more to it than that even for CPP music (you should really watch those Seth Monahan videos if you're taking Theory classes) but again, as others have pointed it, there are plenty of other "correct" things for other styles of music.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Though there's really no telling, I'll give you a possible reason:

"How can I apply..." and "how those manifest themselves".

So let me put this simply:

Music is an Art.

Acoustics is a Science.

And they are two different things.

While science is "present" in music in the same way that math is, it has very little to do with Artistic choices in the creation of music.

IOW, many people have gone to great lengths to define consonance and dissonance, and even how we perceive the two, but one look at actual music will show you that, **despite** any inherent dissonance an interval might have, we not only use it as we see fit, but we may in fact even treat it as a consonance! (or vice versa).

This is why it's considered "subjective" - while we might be able to objectively measure dissonance as some ratio, or some amount of sidebands, or beating, or "critical bands" (look up Helmholz) the way we actually use them in music has little to do with this.

Granted, we generally treat what we generally considered "dissonant" or "unpleasant" intervals in special ways in music, but that changes over time and in various ways so it can't possibly be "measurable" in any broad sense, only say, on a per style (or per time period, etc.) basis.

A tritone is actually not considered "dissonant" in some contexts. For Hindemeth, and some other theorists, the Tritone is actually considered "neutral"! Some of those people "ranked" consonances and dissonances.

But even if you rank them like they did, most people - outside an experiment - don't write music that travels from less consonant to more consonant intervals.

Furthermore, most of this kind of discussion gets bogged down on intervals, and most people actually don't write music in intervals - they write CHORDS, and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and so on.

And, what is dissonant as an interval, can be "tamed" by the introduction of another note. So dissonance once again becomes "variable".

You asked why they were universal - they're not. It's an overemphasis on CPP Tonality. In other styles, things change.

As towards Biological disposition - well, Peppers, are hot. They've evolved hot so that mammals will avoid them, but birds won't, because birds will spread the seeds farther. But we humans love them - and even try to make hotter ones - and something that might be seen as Scientifically "bad" is desirable to include in your nachos. Or, fat is measurable bad for you, but it ain't stopping none of us from eating hamburgers (here in the US, vegas excepted).

IOW, again, we make ART **in spite of** any scientific or biological tendencies. In fact, we seem to take delight in rebelling against those things.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, forget the 5 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> issues for now.

You need to go back to the beginning and learn to spell chords properly first.

It's C-Eb-G, not C-D#-G.

Everything you have as a sharp should be a flat of the next note higher (A# = Bb, etc.).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Does this make the first chord a Cmaj7sus2 ?

Yes. Or we could say, it makes the *<b><u>harmony</u></b>* that.

And yes with the piano player as well.

"<b><u>Harmony</u></b>" (or "the chord") is all of the notes being sounded simultaneously on all instruments.

We sometimes talk about them from the perspective of our own instruments. For example, if you wanted a guitarist to play a G chord to produce this sound with the Bass and Piano doing their thing, you probably wouldn't want to tell them "Play a Cmaj9" because even though it will sound OK, it won't give you the voicing you want (though your voicing also wouldn't be the first thing someone would pick if you said "play G").

This is why sometimes it makes more sense to write chords like so:

C - C/B - C/A - C/G

rather than

C - Cmaj7/B - Am7 - C/G

or other similar patterns. The upper one kind of implies that the thing that makes up the C chord is staying static while the bass note is descending.

If this was done - say, a guitar player playing a C chord, while a Bass player plays the walk down, we don't really always want to tell the guitar player to play C/A or Am7 - we just want them to keep playing C!

So sometimes we do mention them separately, but in reality, the "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" is going to be all the notes sounding at once, not just one any one part plays.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Depends on how strict you want to be. Most people use Tonal and Atonal as polar opposites, and as very broad categories.

Really, things probably should be refined - they have been, just not everyone has learned about them.

There is a thing called "Centric" music which simply defined is music where one note or <b><u>harmony</u></b> is promoted as the "center" - the most important note/chord.

Tonality therefore is a specific type of Centric Music where the center -which we call the Tonic, is promoted through exclusive note sets, functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, melodic and rhythmic emphasis, predictable cadential patterns, and so on.

Modality - the kind that existed before Tonality (Renaissance, Middle Ages, etc.) is also a specific type of Centric music where the center - which we call the Final - is promoted through somewhat similar means, though an emphasis on counterpoint over functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is different.

If you were to map out a chord progression from a Gesualdo piece, I think you'd find if used "normal" known chords, but they don't follow conventional chord progressions.

This is something I try to get across to people...just because a piece uses chords, doesn't make it Tonality.

So one big thing is, most people think Jazz and modern pop music is Tonal - well, it's not by the strictest definition, and it is, in many ways, closer to pre-Tonal Modality. It's "neo-Modality" if you like. Granted there are many modern pieces that are also Tonal, and it really is a continuum, so there's a lot of grey area.

But we absolutely do not call Gesualdo, or Palestrina, or the music they wrote "Tonal". We use an entirely different approach in analyzing it, and different terminology for describing it.

So why shouldn't we do the same for Post-Tonal "somewhat tonal/somewhat modal and possibly somewhat atonal" music?

"Atonality" with a capital A (I say that, not official) is usually reserved for a specific STYLE of composition that is better called Dodecaphony, or 12-Tone Serialism, etc. and more specifically the 12 Tone pieces of Schoenberg and the 2nd Viennese School, and those who adopted that method of composition.

But, Debussy certainly wasn't composing "Tonality" (with a capital T!) and he wasn't really composing like Schoenberg either.

"Atonality" got a bad rap and Schoenberg himself preferred "Pantonality" - music where ALL notes had an equal chance of being heard as the Tonic. So the word Atonal has negative connotations and some might prefer to use "non-tonal" instead. But then it's hard to know if they mean "non-Tonality" Centric music - like Modality, or non-Centric music like "Atonality" (with a capital A :-)

So most people are happy to lump things into broad categories, just like we say "Classical Music" when we mean Baroque, Classical, and Romantic period music, and I've even heard the term used to refer to pretty much anything that's not pop music and instrumental orchestral/chamber/solo instrument music.

But there are definitely finer distinctions that exist, and IMHO, are worth understanding, whatever term we us to describe them.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>How can you?

Simple. The minor scale doesn't have the notes necessary for making those chords. Thus if you are "making a chord progression from a minor scale" (the assumption would be Natural Minor) then you CAN'T get those chords.

But I suspect you're missing something that most people have not been taught because it's rampant here:

Traditionally music is written in **KEYS** not scales.

In a traditional minor **KEY**, the "5" chord is a V or V7 when that function is needed for the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Many would say that a **piece of music** (not necessarily a chord progression, becuase music is neither about chord progressions nor scales for the most part) that's written using notes only from the notes of the **Key Signature** for Minor would be in "Aeolian Mode", or "Modern Minor" rather than the *traditional* Minor Key.

So, if you want to make a chord progression (or better, write a piece of music) that uses notes exclusively from the Minor Key, then you simply do that. You just simply don't use V or V7 as they contain altered notes. You could even avoid any "5" chord altogether.

Cm - Eb - Bb - Cm is a Minor Key Chord Progression.

Cm - Fm - Eb - Bb - is a Minor Key Chord Progression.

Cm - Bb - Ab - Bb - is a Minor Key Chord Progression.

None of them use "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" and none of them are "Tonality proper", and all would imply the use of "Natural Minor", which is not "traditional minor" (though these chords can be found in traditional pieces, just not in this manner in "looping" progressions) and thus might better be called "Modern Minor" or "Aeolian Mode" instead of a "Minor Key".

But, "minor scale" assumed to mean "natural minor" - they all come from that.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>It's hard to say there's anything "wrong" with it.

We could compare it to some specific genre and then point out all the ways it doesn't conform, but if you didn't intend to emulate that genre, then it really doesn't matter.

The problem with a piece like this is, it's close enough to some existing styles where we're going to naturally compare this to them, and in that comparison, I think there are some things that might raise a few eyebrows - would be considered "wrong" or "amateurish" etc.

Again, you might be going more for an Early Music "Estampie" kind of vibe rather than a Baroque Lute and Recorder piece, so it's really hard to say.

But with that in mind, one thing that sticks out to me are the E/F pairs like in m.6.

You have E against F that moves to F - so a 9th to an 8ve (or duplicate).

It comes of as a "lack of <b><u>harmony</u></b>". It's like the beginning - I'm not sure why you chose to run those lines at the 8ve and then didn't really do it again (aside from repeats). It could have been a nice feature to use in contrast to the contrapuntal stuff (though the bit at m. 21 is really effective call back, but then the repeat of the A motive right after in unison kind of steals its thunder).

So I'm not sure why you're choosing these E/F pairs. Like if you look at m. 9 it's a more traditional harmonic approach and fuller and more consistent.

m. 14 exhibits a similar thing - you've got a B^o triad in the LH with these two E notes against it.

Let's put it this way - the E is not in the chord, the F is, but you've got 75% E, and only 25% F against the chord. It's backwards of what you usually want. There's a lot of that going on.

It does happen in older style music - I know some Estampies that are exactly like that - dissonances that to those familiar with more typical CPP music makes them go "wait, are you sure that's the right note?"

But I'm not sure if you want people to go, "wait, was that the right note" when they hear or play it.

And becuase this is roughly similar to things they already are familiar with, you might get that kind of response unintentionally. If that was your intent though,  you nailed it.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Well, the problem with asking for feedback is you can either get things that are so critical it's depressing, or you get "great job, I like it" which doesn't really help you all that much.

It's very hard for people in places like this to give you anything specific unless you ask for things that are specific.And again, there's no "right or wrong" in general, but, if one is trying to emulate a specific thing, there is right and wrong that can be objectively identified and corrected if necessary.

You would probably really benefit from some private lessons. You've got a nice melodic sense here, and you've got some formal basics down which work nicely. There are also some very nice ideas in spots.

But really it seems like you're missing the basics of counterpoint and <b><u>harmony</u></b> which doesn't allow the piece to realize its full potential.

You're going to spend a lot of time just making stuff that might only get better a little at a time, where if you sat down and worked with someone you could get better a lot faster.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Congratulations, you just invented Negative <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. Oh, wait...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>As the other poster explains, what you're usually seeing is "modern harmonizations" in a TONAL context of what was originally a MODAL piece.

In a sense, the melody of the chant is "tonalized" by the accompaniment when it's done like you say.

Bach's Chorales use Lutheran hymns, many of which were handed down from plainchant melodies. As such, you find some of them pretty much in their raw form.

However, Bach, being a tonal composer, "tonalized" many of them. So many of the Phrygian ones (in E) look to us like they're harmonized in Am instead.

Interestingly, many of Bach's chorales are actually a lot more modal than most people realize, but there is always a certain "tonalization" going on of what was otherwise a modal tune.

If you think about "Greensleeves" (What Child is This?), you'll often hear it done one of two ways - "what child is this *who* - on that word, you either get b6 making it pretty much traditional minor, or sometimes you get natural 6, making it Dorian. I heard it first in the "tonalized" minor version, so the Dorian version always sounds a bit funky to me.

But it's really about how a particular arranger chose to set it. Listen to what Charles Ives did with some basic folk songs and I think you'll see that can be set in many different ways!

So yeah, a Gregorian Chant is "unaccompanied" with no <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

So when you see it in ANY kind of harmonic/accompanied setting, it's been arranged to whatever the composer chose - in the Renaissance it would have been set modally, but in the Baroque and beyond, it would have been set tonally (now, whether a Phrygian piece becomes Am, or Em, is another topic!) and in the case of Ives, it could be set atonally.

Cheers
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I get what you're saying.

But I suppose, the simplest answer is, it begins in F with a key signature to match.

So if someone were to say "I like that Chopin Ballade" the other person might say "he wrote a number of them, which one?". 

"The one in F".

No one who doesn't know which number it is is going to know the Opus number.

I don't know how much you want to get into it, but this is the problem applying Tonality to everything just because it has notes and chords, and is in some keys some of the time.

Chopin was certainly pushing the boundaries of Tonality - look at the Prelude in Em (see, I call it that, not knowing the opus number). There are all these "tonally informed" or "tonally biased" explanations of what is going on, which are completely uninformative.

I mean, a better - or maybe more informative - description of the piece would be "it begins in F, and ends in Am".

I don't see anything wrong with that. It points out a particular, and unusual (for the tonally biased) quality worth pointing out.

Besides, calling something "in X" is really just a convenience for describing it - I wouldn't ever put too much theoretical weight on it. It's kind of like looking at something called "Sonata" - there are many kinds.

It's also like today, we might say a pop tune is "in G" - well, it's as likely to be G Mixolydian as G Major, but we just say "in G" so all the players start on the right <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It's just a convenience for cataloging - because it starts that way.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Consonance and Dissonance *in music* is based on **context**. The following applies to Common Practice Period music, in practice:

To make things simple, *any* Augmented or Diminished interval is *considered* a dissonance.

So, what *sounds* like a m3 out of context, but is *spelled* like an +2 in context, will be dissonant.

The basic rule for dissonances in Common Practice Period <b><u>harmony</u></b> are:

1. Any Augmented or Diminished interval is dissonant.

2. Any 2nd or 7th is dissonant.

3. Any 4th formed with the lowest voice is dissonant.

And that's pretty much it.

Note above that I said any +/o interval is **considered** a dissonance.

What you need to understand is there is a difference between objective, subjective, and contextual dissonance.

Objectively, people have done tests to measure physical responses of the ear drum and cochlea to determine that certain intervals produce physical reactions in humans that produce the subjective feeling of "unpleasantness" compared to other intervals that do not produce the same physical reactions.

Subjectively, people don't care about such things, and notions of consonance and dissonance are *learned* and cultural.

Contextually, none of the above makes a difference because dissonance is based on MUSICAL STYLE.

Probably the best case to understand the latter, and really the crux of the matter, is the interval of the Perfect 4th, which has been "treated as" consonant in some styles, and dissonant in others, and context-dependent in others.

One issue a lot of people today who are learning about CPP music have is they are often taught, in a simplified manner, that dissonance "sounds bad". Therefore, they never understand why a 2nd inversion chord is *treated as* as dissonance. After all, it doesn't "sound bad" to them. But it did "sound like it needed resolution" to people in the 1700s, becuase that's what they were used to hearing.

So, in early Parallel Organum, only two intervals were used: A 2nd line was added at either the interval of the 5th, or 4th, above or below a Chant to produce parallel <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

In this style (context), the Perfect 4th was absolutely, 100% consonant (though any diminished 4th, which could be produced by staying in the mode, was dissonant and altered - see Dasian Scale).

As time went on, the Perfect 4th came to be treated as a dissonance instead.

There are various styles, but one, Faux Bordoune, used what looks like Parallel 1s inversion triads to us. It's not really clear if the Perfect 4th formed between the upper and middle voice was dissonant or not - really, it appears that they didn't care because at that time, what was important was if the interval was dissonant with the lowest voice or not.

This idea carries over into the CPP.

Essentially, a 4th is dissonant with the Bass, but not other voices. Therefore, a 1st Inversion triad, which has the 4th between some pair of upper voices, was - if not considered dissonant - was at least *treated as* an *acceptable* interval. But a 2nd inversion triad has a P4 between the lowest voice and some other upper voice. This was a "no no" and unacceptable in some contexts, and again, whether the interval is objectively or subjectively dissonant or not, it was *treated as* as dissonance in that context and *had to resolve* (note also that the only way diminished triads typically appear in CPP music in in 1st inversion, because this places the dissonant +4 between the upper voices - root position makes a o5 with the bass, and 2nd inversion puts the +4 between the bass and an upper voice).

Today, most people don't care. You get 2nd inversion triads running in parallel in music. Because we're not in the Common Practice Period anymore and the musical STYLE has changed.

For example, while many Jazz players will tell you that a 7th chord is "dissonant" or that a 7th is a dissonant interval, 7th chords themselves are not always *treated as* dissonances that must resolve. Sometimes they do, but a LOT of times they don't.

So it really doesn't matter if dissonance can be measured objectively or not, and to some degree our subjective understanding of dissonance, becuase it's more important if you want to understand *how dissonance is used in music(* to understand the musical style and the context. There's no need to shout about the P4 being dissonant with the bass when talking about Parallel Organum. And there's no need to go into any objective physics explanation about the consonance of the P4 when it's *treated as* as dissonance in CPP music.

IOW we use intervals the way we want to use them *in spite of* any objective consonance or dissonance, and *treat them* how we want through practices common to particular styles.

In CPP music, dissonance is a matter of context, and how dissonances resolve when used are also dependent on that context.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Thanks for the highlight!

Yes, agreed, it's essentially a Dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b>, necessitating B (not Bb) which in turn, necessitates the A (not Ab) assuming he wanted to avoid the +2, which is what was chosen.


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>All this depends on how "traditional" or "typical" you want to get. So please understand I'm approaching it from that standpoint.

You know, looking at this, it seems you're doing what a lot of people do - you're trying to write music based on how you THINK it is written, without any actual evidence of HOW COMPOSERS ACTUALLY WRITE FOR VIOLIN AND PIANO!

It would really serve you well to look at 100, or 1,000 Violin and Piano pieces. I mean, really, how many Violin and Piano pieces did you look at before you tried to compose this?

Your piano part is very "atypical" and really shows a very basic understanding. There's nothing wrong with that and everyone has to start somewhere, especially if it's not your main instrument!

But the whole "block chords" and playing triads in close position is really "beginner" stuff.

Usually, piano doesn't play 3 note chords in the LH like you have here. Especially when it gets low like the Am chords on the low side of the staff, or the Dm/F with the F below the staff. Instead, you might have what they call "Piano Style" 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> which is 3 notes in the RH (usually a triad form) and a single note or octaves (to thicken) in the bass (like what you have in measures 24 and 25).

The section at 16 is more typical block chord use in the LH, though usually rhe RH might play a melody against that, or in this case, could double the Violin melody (at pitch, or an octave above for some "sparkle", more like what you did at 27 etc.) or just - heaven forbid, lay out altogether!

The "accent" on beat 3 is OK but again, it's a close position triad.

24 and 25 are also more typical of a single bass against the chord.

63 is unplayable (I just saw 10 has the same issue - notes too far apart - might be able to use the pedal and take them, but it's just bad notation and not a great choice).

58 and 61 kind of show your "dependence on triads" because even your 16th note runs like this tend to be parallel triads. 

Scanning through I don't even seen any 7th chords. There are a couple of spots where you play, say, a Dm chord on beat 1, and then the upper part moves to Em, which produces some kind of complex <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but it comes off more as "you don't know what you're doing" rather than "intentional complex <b><u>harmony</u></b> for no reason in an otherwise simple <b><u>harmony</u></b> piece". Luckily, because they're essentially doubling the violin, they come of as melodic doublings rather than independent harmonies *most* of the time, but there are some spots where they come off as a bit funky. So I mean, it's like the only chord you know seems to be triads.

Your rhythmic notation needs a bit of work as well - while we do use "shortcuts" for some syncopations things like your first and fourth measures are "wrong" - you shouldn't have the dotted note on Beat 2 in the first measure, or the half note on and of beat 2 in the 4th measure (which is way worse!). Musicians are used to reading rhythms written out in specific ways and when you do this it obscures the beat, making it much harder to perform.

Seriously, take a look at a lot of Violin and Piano duets, preferably by established, professional composers. They don't have to be Violin Sonatas (though looking at those wouldn't hurt) but I think it would give you a much better idea of idiomatic writing for the piano and how the two instruments interact in more typical ways.

This is great to get your ideas down. I think you can "improve" them in the sense of bringing them more in line with traditional writing for these two instruments. You could rework this as you learn more, or just keep writing more pieces - but just make sure if you want to write "idiomatically" for both style and instrument, to continue to learn more about things rather than just blindly plopping notes you think "sound good" into a notation program or something.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's OK to omit a chord member (or sometimes 2 or more!) if the CONTEXT is clear, and there's enough other aural information to help us figure out what <b><u>harmony</u></b> is being IMPLIED by the notes that are present.

While in the case of guitar, there is a limitation because of the number of strings and how far you can physically reach, it happens for other instruments as well.

The 5th of a chord is often seen as the "least important" note in determining what the chord is, and especially in 7th chords (and especially in jazz) the 5th is very often omitted (but it even happens in classical music).

The practice stems from part-writing with only 3 voices - you've only got 3 notes to work with, so which do you leave off? Well, the root is important as it tells you what the chord is. The 7th has to be there or it's not even a 7th chord! The 3rd of the chord determines whether the chord is major or minor, so it's important.

So in a basic Dominant 7th (which shares the same kind of 5th with minor7 and major7) the 5th is the "least important".

There are situations where sometimes the 3rd of the chord is left off instead, and in any chord where the 5th is riased or lowered (7#5 for example) then it HAS to be there and it's the 3rd that has to be implied.

And also, when you're in a key, the other notes of the key are usually assumed, so if you leave off the 5th of a C7 in the key of F, the assumption is that if it were there, it would be a G note, because that note is in the key. This has become so common that now, we can hear these chords as Dominant 7th chords in any key.

So you're right - in theory, the notes of a C7 chord are C-E-G-Bb.

But, the G is commonly omitted, and sometimes the E is instead.

And you can have as many duplicates of any of the notes as you want, and they can appear in any voicing (order).

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>1. What instrument do you play? Since you said "metal" and "modes" I'll assume you're a guitarist. How did you learn to play metal? Or do you write metal tunes? If so, was it after you learned to play metal, or were you just sitting around the house one day and said "I'd like to write a metal tune" with no idea of what to do, or what "metal" used as melodic and harmonic resources, and so on? Your first attempt at a metal tune may have been "cheesy" as well. You have to really live and breathe a genre before you can competently compose in it.

2. A "baroque" trio has FOUR instruments in it - two melody instruments, a basso continuo, and a "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" instrument. The Basso and <b><u>Harmony</u></b> instruments are together called the "continuo" and basically play together - the left hand of the Harpsichord doubles the notes played by the bass instrument (such as cello) and then using the RH (or remaning fingers on the LH) to "fill out" the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (based on what the two melody instruments are playing). So it's usually more like 2 Violins, Cello, and Harpsichord.

3. There are certainly "trio" pieces for just 3 instruments, but what you're talking about (Gavotte, etc.) is usually like a "Trio Sonata" type piece. Violin, Cello, and Harpsichord is more like the Classical "Piano Trio" of Violin, Cello, and Piano - so you're kind of mixing genres.

4. How many Gavottes have you listened to, analyzed, and learned to play? That's where you start. Otherwise, all you're doing is making "what you think is Baroque-sounding based on your limited knowledge of Baroque music" - there are entire genres - especially in metal - the whole "Bach Rock" school - see Yngwie J. Malmsteen and the subsequent shred school. They made music that pulled out a few "Baroque-sounding" elements (mainly Harmonic minor scale) and used some forms and such (Preludes, etc.) but were really just composing prog metal with some "Baroque-like flavor" thrown in. So if you want to follow that path, fine. Plenty of precedents. If you instead want to try to write more like 400 year old music (which may be just as much folly...) then you need to live and breathe it for a while - just like you did with metal.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I think this is a great place to ask a question like this.

But I have a couple for you first, because it can make it easier to help you on this quest:

1. Any particular reason it's Violin and Viola?

2. Any particular reason it's 7/8?

3. What is "ambiguous" about the process?

I'm going to assume you have little or no composing experience based on the things you've asked, so take that into consideration for these next comments:

1. Do you play either the Violin or Viola? Do you play any instrument?

2. How much music for Violin and Viola, or any duet have you looked at already?

3. You said "song" but usually a classical type duet is called a "piece" or "work" or "composition" and only "song" if either it's very "song like" in nature (called by some composers, a  "song without words") or an actual sung song (or possibly, an arrangement or transcription of something that was originally a song, etc.). If you "don't know how to start" it could just be that you have written a lot of music and don't even know how others do it - which again would be something to find out. While a lot of people flounder around, most people who learn to write music do it by simply learning to play music of others, then figure out what's going on, and then try to recreate it. How successfully you can recreate it usually depends on how skilled you are with the various tools you have - for example, it's really hard to recreate a contrapuntal piece if you don't know anything about counterpoint, even if you know a lot about <b><u>harmony</u></b> and so on.

Along with that last question - and the reason I'm asking is, what kind of piece do you really want to write? "Classical Style", 12-Tone, Bach-like Counterpoint, Parallel Organum (which would be easy for the 2nd instrument!), Drone and Melody style (like Bagpipes), Stochastic music, Integral Serialism, Jazz, Pop, etc.????

There's this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzemq3bpz54

But that's nothing a beginner should attempt.

But then there's this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnrzK6v4AK0

It's originally a Keyboard piece IIRC, and one Mozart wrote when he was like 7 or 5 or something. Now we're not all Mozart of course, and even for a "beginner" he was advanced, but this is much simpler than the later one and something someone with a bit of experience could try to tackle.

But you may want to begin with something even more basic, with an obvious melody for the violin and the viola "accompanying" as the two hands to here in this piano version:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1gGxpitLO8

IOW, you need to find a model, and base your piece on that - that's how people get started. It's great that you decided on a few things, but you now need to decide what kind of style and so on, and again using a model really helps hone in those decisions for you so you can get on to writing without having all these options that ultimately drive you crazy!


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Traditionally, the v and bVII chord in minor keys were changed to be V (a Major triad) or V7 (etc.) and vii^o (diminished triad) or vii^o7 (etc.).

This was to give more "push" to the Tonic in a similar way that the Major Keys have those chords. The changed note, scale degree 7, is a half step below the Tonic note in Major Keys, and you could say that using the V or vii^o in minor uses that same scale degree 7 from Major, again making it a half step below the Tonic, or you could say that in minor keys, we raise the 7th scale degree a half step and this causes the v and bVII chords to become V and vii^o

In either case, this produces DOMINANT FUNCTION V and vii^o chords, just like major.

This was actually a historical practice that predates the Major-Minor system but one of the things we see is that if Minor (natural minor) is the same notes and chords as major, just "shifted", there's a danger that certain chord progressions in Minor will sound like a "more typically major" progression. For example, iv - bVII - bIII is going to sound like ii - V - I in the relative major.

So Fm - Bb - Eb sounds like ii-V-I in Eb Major, not iv - bVII - bIII in C Minor. By changing the Bb chord so it's B^o , it sounds more like it should resolve to Cm thus rather than the music in minor keys constantly "drifting towards major" (or drifting towards bIII) it re-orients the music back to the Minor Tonic.

"Harmonic Minor" is an gross misunderstanding on the part of most people, but the problem is it has been used "wrong" enough times to make it "ok".

But the thing is, historically speaking, you don't use "scales". You use KEYS.

The KEY is Cm.

In the V chord, and the vii^o chord, the 7th scale degree Bb is raised one half step to B Natural.

And that's it.

A lot of people "oversimply" that and say "you're playing harmonic minor" and in the case of improvisation that is "scale-based" it can make sense to do that.

But in traditional music, we didn't use III+ and imM7 in Minor keys. We ONLY adjusted the 7th scale degree when there was a HARMONIC reason to do so - to change the <b><u>HARMONY</u></b> - and that's why they ended up calling it a Harmonic Minor Scale.

Melodic Minor works similarly - it's not "really" a scale but another mnemonic device to show you how scale degrees 6 and 7 often operate in MELODIC contexts in traditional minor key music. Ever wonder why it's different going up than down (and is the only one that does that)? Again, because it's not really a scale at all nor was never meant to be (but it got misinterpreted and ended up turning into "Jazz Minor" and now is such a thing that we could call it a "scale" in it's own right).

In most melodic contexts in minor keys, both 6 and 7 are raised when ascending, and in their natural state when descending.

Very often the 7 is raised for a harmonic, functional reason, but if it is being approached by the 6th melodically (which means it's coming from below, thus an ascending melody) 6 is raised too - that's what we're shown as the ascending portion of Melodic Minor.

So they were never really intended to "build chords from" but that's how people ended up using them.

But even in classical music, the use of raised 6 does cause harmonic changes on any chord it appears on. this means in Minor KEYS, the following chords are possible:

i

ii^o (rarely ii, using #6)

bIII

iv (sometimes IV using #6)

V (using #7, rarely v using natural 7)

bVI

#vi^o (usually a m7b5 chord, using #6 as the root)

bVII (using natural 7, but somewhat uncommon, and usually acting like V/bIII)

vii^o (using #7)

It's a misunderstanding by modern people that bIII+ is used in minor. It wasn't. It's a modern "misinterpretation" that has become used though.

And the two chords with #6 - IV and #vi^o are rarely used without leading pretty much directly to V or vii^o respectively. Again, they are a result of the melodic motion from 6 to 7, which if 7 is raised, means 6 has to be as well in a melodic context.

BTW, people call them "circle of 5ths progressions" but that's really also a misunderstanding. The Circle of 5ths is a diagram, laid out in a circle, showing that keys that are a 5th apart add or subtract one accidental. IOW, the Circle of 5ths is a diagram of **KEYS** not CHORDS!

It just happens that the chord progressions are in 5ths so people conflate the two.

But a "5ths progression" is just that - roots a 5th apart WITHIN A SINGLE KEY typically (at least how you've listed them is how you commonly see them listed).

And in those progressions, in minor, if you want to send it to the Tonic, you use V or vii^o but if you want to continue the cycle (I prefer "Cycle of 4ths Progressions" as the term) you can use bVII like so:

i - iv - bVII - bIII - bVI - ii^o - V - i

But traditional minor and classical music are a little different from Jazz and contemporary uses, so context is important.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, think of it this way:

You're not harmonizing the tonic triad in tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> to make a diminished chord, and are using a quartal stack.

So that means, you're OK with a "non traditional" as the "tonic" chord.

Why not, then just B-D, or B-D-E, B-D-A, or B-C-D, and so on. In other words, you could do Secundal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or anything that essentially avoids the 5th.

It is commonplace for Classical pieces to end on either just the tonic note with no <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or a tonic chord that omits the 5th.

So there's no reason you couldn't do that in Locrian as well.

What you're doing is absolutely worth a try though - see what happens! Let us hear your results!!!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, so "Avoid Parallel" 5ths is further downstream, part of the rules of Voice-Leading that apply not only to Fugues, but to any contrapuntally-based or descended style of <b><u>harmony</u></b> writing.

So that's like a rule that says, a Fugue must contain notes!

So, a Fugue, is a Type of Musical Composition that is Polyphonic, and Contrapuntal, uses particular forms of Imitative Counterpoint, and typically has 3 sections, an Exposition, Middle Entries (or Development Section), and a Closing Section (or Recapitulation).

There is a Subject, which is typically the first thing heard, usually unaccompanied, that is a Melody that often contains rather recognizable elements in terms of pitch and rhythm, so that it may easily be identified each time in enters throughout the piece. After the Subject enters, it comes in again in some other voice, in a different Key and is called the Answer.

Traditionally, the Subject begins in the Tonic Key and the Answer will be in the Dominant. There are even things that can be said about Subjects and we have Real and Tonal Answers, and there are certain things that typically happen when the Subject begins on the Dominant Scale Degree for example, that makes the Answer "reply" in a specific way.

Each successive Subject or Answer will enter in either the Tonic or Dominant key respectively, and usually goes T-D-T-D for 4 parts, though sometimes you might get T-D-D-T and so on. If it's only a 3 voice fugue it would be T-D-T.

The material played against the Answer is usually called the Counter-subject especially when it takes on a significant role in the composition (keeps coming back against any future Answers and Subject entries, etc.).

Once the Subjects and Answers have all entered (you'd have 4 things for 4 voices, etc.) then the Exposition is complete. The Exposition itself may do something like have S-A, then an "episode" which might be music based on the Counter-subject, or some part of the Subject, or just new material before the other 2 voices enter, or all 4 voices may just enter back to back with no intervening episodes (and this is why it's hard to make rules because that's variable from work to work - some fugues have episodes in the Exposition, some don't).

Then there may be more episodic material, but you then get a section of "middle entries" where the Subjects and Answers and Counter-subjects - or portions thereof, motives derived from them and so on, are treated "developmentally" usually going through various permutations and keys (you may get the Subject presented in Inversion, and so on). You can also have "False Entries" where it sounds like one is coming in, but doesn't finish.

Then you usually get a statement of the original S-A pairs in the original key, which marks the closing section.

There is often (but not always - see, no rules) a "Stretto" where the Answers come in before the Subject finishes so they're more overlapped than they were initially.

So aside from it being a Polyphonic, Imitative Counterpoint piece with Subjects and Answers in the Tonic and Dominant keys (or pitch levels) respectively, it is comprised of 3 sections with an Exposition, middle entries, and some kind of closing section.

That's about all we can really pin down. The rest of the stuff is variable. It may or may not contain episodes, it may or may not contain Stretti, and so on.

Works that aren't "full fugues" or are just an Exposition etc. are called "Fughetta" or "Fugal Sections" and so on.

Some Fugues have more than one Subject, and these are called Double Fugues (2 subjects) and Triple Fugues (3 subjects). Anything bigger than that is pretty rare.

The wikipedia article actually gives a very nice overview of the form:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue

But none of this goes into things like what harmonies to use, or anything like that. There are certain things about Tonal and Real answers that we can say, but overall, that stuff is up to the composer. And a modern Fugue might very well use Parallel 5ths.

Think of it like a "Novel". It doesn't matter if the book uses some made up language like "A Clockwork Orange" - the definition of "Novel" is the form - you know, paragraphs, chapters, and so on. But what words you use, or language you use, or grammar you use, or even if you make up words - it's still a Novel as long as it meets the definition of a Novel. But Poems, Short Stories, and even "Novellas" and "Novelettes" all use words the same kinds of ways - so those aren't really the definition of a "Novel" per se.

So, IOW, you'd avoid paralle 5ths not becuase you're writing a fugue, but because you're writing in a harmonic style that avoids parallel 5ths, which you're using in the form of a fugue, if that makes sense.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Doh, I just actually looked at your username! Should have been clear to me!!!

I think it would be totally OK - unless there are additional parameters required by the assignment - to write a Trio for 3 instruments in a "baroque-like style".

What I would do if I were you is look up - if you haven't already - Baroque Suite and pick a couple of the typical dance forms - Gavotte being one - but Minuet, Gigue, Sarabande, and so on.

The "typical" form was Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Variable, Gigue - Variable was often a Minuet.

But they're all kind of interchangeable.

There are actually some easy-ish pieces played by Guitarists on Classical Guitar because they were originally done on Lute.

I think you could use this to your advantage - the Bouree in Em from Bach's Lute Suite is pretty accessible and you've probably heard arrangements of it:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKSg8t4zyLg

It's two parts - so you could easily arrange something like this for Violin and Cello for example.

In Bach's day, he would have just "filled out" the <b><u>harmony</u></b> on Harpsichord - so you take the two melodies here, figure out what chords are implied, and that's what the Harpsichord does (though it could double one or even both of the lines.

If it were me, I'd crack open the DAW, and work on some ideas as like a modern pop song approach - Bass Line, Melody Line, and <b><u>Harmony</u></b> Part - all of which you could work out on guitar.

That way you can take what you already know, and apply it to these kinds of instruments. You'll have to learn their ranges and so on, but yeah - do some listening, look at some pieces, and write some simple "dances" (which is what all those little pieces in a Suite are). That way you don't get bogged down trying to write something heavy-duty or virtuosic.

Look at Bach's "Anna Magdelena Notebook" which has some comparatively easier pieces in it, but can give you a lot of ideas (because if you look at something like the French or English Suites, they're probably too involved to help you much).

Good Luck.

Would love to see the result when you get done!

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br> Go ahead and charge in! The worst that can happen is you throw it in the garbage can :-D

So - looking at violin and viola duets - and since you can play the instruments, learning to play them is EXTREMELY important. Also, you need to ANALYZE them - figure out how the two parts interact - how they support each other, and so on - I think those are all the ambiguous steps you're missing.

Usually, you identify the key, see which notes are played in the key and not, and when not, why. Then you look at <b><u>harmony</u></b> - what kinds of intervals are used, or chords are created or implied when 2 or more parts play together. You look at the form, cadences, phrase structure, and so on.

And then you charge in and try to replicate it! Again, good news is if you make a mistake, erase it and fix it! And you can learn these things a little at a time - most people learn how to write music in a key before they start using notes outside of the key for example.

You say you don't know where to look - how about putting "Violin and Viola Duet" into some search engine?

There are probably all other kinds of 2 part pieces for Keyboard, other instrument duets, and so on you could use as models. Flute and Clarinet, or Oboe and Clarinet, or Trumpet and Horn or Trumpet and Trombone duets all would have similar ranges to Violin and Viola (or Cello).

So obviously you'd want to look at music for strings for specific techniques, but for compositional techniques, any instrument will do.

It wouldn't be a bad idea to consider taking composition lessons with someone.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>????

There is no jazz in music theory.

Music theory is in most styles. A C chord is a C chord in classical music, Jazz, or rock.

But, each style does have things about it that are particular to those styles - for exmaple, most rock players don't really need to talk about "tensions" and "Phrygian Dominant" and all that stuff. Nor do classical musicians. But those are Jazz elements or we could say they're theory elements specific to Jazz but not other styles.

What may be giving you that impression is that generally speaking, aside from those people who are academically or "classically" trained, the vast majority of people who are both interested in and even need music theory at more than just a basic level are jazz players.

It actually kind of irks me because someone will ask a simple question and the jazz player will come in and go "you can reharmonize it with Lydian Dominant to give you an altered sound on the Subdominant for your backdoor progression into the Tritone Sub" when the answer was "Key of C Major".

Or maybe a less silly example is when someone asks about a triad and someone immediately assumes 7th chords - they might as well put a scarlet J on their chest.

I always respond with "not all music is Jazz".

In fact, it's really quite small of a market share compared to other styles.

But, again, since those are the people who have tended to study theory (or think they've studied theory) more, forums like this can look like they're all about jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Not all music is jazz, and music theory applies to most music - some of it has some specifics unique to that style, but a Major 3rd is a Major 3rd in Organum, Renaissance Polyphony, Mozart, Stravinsky, even Schoenberg, and in Jazz, and Rock, and Country, and so on.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's in C.

Many of the accidentals are wrong.

It also Modulates - a lot.

I agree, bar 24 "would be" the cadence point if it ever came to rest.

The A at the 5th bar is in the melody only, and it's a different note than the <b><u>harmony</u></b> so it can't be the "I" chord.

Notice instead that in bar 24 it's C in BOTH parts - much more "final" sounding.

Here's a skeletal analysis:

Key of C:

1. I

2.  V7/IV or just "I7" to bV (F#, as far away as you can get from C - could be heard as a modulation already, but it's brief)

3. Still bV then vii^o7 / iii which goes to 

4. vii^o7 / iii to V7/vi

5. IV (deceptive resolution of a secondary dominant)

8. I

9. I - viio or viim7b5 counting the A note in the next measure

10. I (after the A)

After the double bar, it does a "bluesy" I7 - IV7 kind of thing back and forth then there are 2 vii^o7 measures, followed by I6/4, what might be considered a ii or V/V kind of thing, then I, or V, or I6/4 - I, etc.

It's the highly chromatic melody line and additional chromaticism in the accompaniment that makes it so odd, but really, aside from that wild jump to F# at the beginning, it's pretty much using I - IV, and vii^o as the main chords, with the other chords "embellishing" them - providing chromatic approaches and so on.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, what do you want to know about this thing?

You've transcribed it, correct? This is an existing piece of music from Final Fantasy that you've transcribed/arranged in Musescore as we see it now, correct?

In essence, by transcribing this piece, you've already "dissected" it. It is not tonal music so talking about functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or Keys, or anything like that is useless.

It's closer to "set theory" or something else.

We can use terms to describe things.

For example, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is Dmadd2 (or Dmadd9 if you like). Or it's a Dm chord with an added 2nd. However you want to say it.

The Melody is the ascending portion of D Melodic Minor (or D Jazz Minor if you like).

The idea is fully transposed down a step and repeated, then down a 3rd and repeated.

Then up a 5th and repeated (there is a sense of a "resolution" here but it's due primarily to our tonal conditioning).

When the new idea starts, it returns to the Dmadd2 <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Since this is the same as the first chord, and it's the beginning of a new idea, we might say that D is "more important" somehow.

However, after the E, it sounds more like the beginning with the transposition of a 2nd down. That serves more to obscure the importance of the D. So sonically, it's ambiguous - the E sounds more important, on paper, the D is more important, and we're torn as listeners becuase while we think E, the D begins a new section.

But, as the section goes on, the D note becomes a Drone/Pedal, and it becomes clear that it's a repeat of the opening section, with D as "more important" in some way.

After that, it seems to become busier, adding more parts, while keeping this same "main" idea repeating and as a "ground" (see Ground Bass in music, Passamezzo Antico, etc.).

After that, there's enough going on on that I'd need to be paid to analyze it further.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you're truly serious, you should study with someone.

There are many options, including but not limited to courses offered by universities, community colleges, private music schools, and even individual music instructors. Universities might also be able to recommend grad students or talented undergrads that could tutor you.

If you insist on self-study, it's really difficult because there's so much information out there - a lot of it incorrect, and the vast majority of it non-pedagogical. Most people who have "self studied" at best just know the "fundamentals of music" which is not really "theory" at all (barely scratches the surface) and at worst have huge gaps in their knowledge and don't know as much as they think they know, learned it all wrong, and can't really use it for much.

From what you've said, you really don't have your fundamentals down yet, and you really should get those before going on.

Ability to read Bass Clef is a must (if you're serious. You could get by without it, but there's a huge gap in your knowledge from the get go).

You need more than a loose understanding of how "many" scales work.

Instead you need to understand KEYS. From there, it tells you how all your scales work - so already you're spending time on things that aren't helping you in the long run, and coming at things from the wrong direction like so many do.

But, FWIW, if you look at the Contents of most University level theory/<b><u>harmony</u></b> texts, they'll give a good idea of the basic order to learn things in.

The big issue is, unless you're forced to cover the material in the correct order in a class, you probably won't! Most people want to be wowed and excited by theory and learn something and find some magic recipe to suddenly understand music and write music, but that's not how it works.

It's dry, and boring, and if you try to "skip ahead to the exciting stuff", you miss the basics, have these gaps in your knowledge, and spend WAY more time trying to learn some simple concept because you're missing a basic than you would if you put in the boring time to learn the basic!

Music Theory is like if a mom asks a kid if they want cookies and the kid says "yes" and the mom says, "OK, first we have to find a recipe, then we have to get a job to afford the ingredients and get an uber to the store and back, then measure out the ingredients, combine them according to the recipe, follow the directions, let them cool before we eat them - it's not instant gratification!

Learn your notes, in both Bass and Treble clef, including notes above and below the staff. Bonus points if you understand how middle C relates to the two clefs. Would not hurt to learn scientific pitch notation (C4 is middle C, etc.)


Learn how to construct Major and Minor scales based on interval, at which point you learn tones, and semitones, and accidentals.

Learn your Key signatures. Major and Minor. All of them. Practice them every day until you die. Musicians do. We use them every day.

Learn your intervals. How to calculate them.

Learn your chords. Formulas for chords. Diatonic chords.

and on it goes.

While there are plenty of resources in the sidebar, here's one that might help because it's broken up by topic and in a pedagogical order:

HTH

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hmmm, it's most likely something to do with a psychological effect - perception as you say - and may have a name in psychology or psychology of music circles.

For some reason, we "conceptualize" <b><u>harmony</u></b> from the lowest note.

This may be a question of why some cultures read left to right, and others right to left (and IIRC, some bottom to top).

The Greeks apparently conceptualized music differently - their modes, which ultimately became (or at least inspired) our 8 Ecclesiastical Modes were calculated from the HIGHEST note down.

There's not necessarily any logic to this either, but one of their instruments had strings and they named the strings according to their relationship to the body "the string closest to the body" for example - whether it was high or low.

So the way we conceptualize notes can be influenced by practical factors rather than solely aural ones.

Even with the first <b><u>harmony</u></b>, there doesn't seem to be a preference for whether the added voice was added above or below the Cantus Firumus.

But somehow, along the line, we formed a preference for "low to high" thinking - in the listing of the 8 Modes for example. This may have simply been tied into Left to Right, "listing" common in the language. So unlike the Greeks, early western theorists organized the modes from low to high.

That probably set the stage for our "hearing" the "beginning note" which was also the lowest note, as "more important" and what everything else "related to" or later "was built on".

One of my musical pet peeves is when someone spells Bass "base", but the word does come from the same root - the "base" or "foundation" of what something is built on.

So we have learned, through thousands of years, to judge everything else in relation to the bass note. So as the other poster said, all the interval relations *in relation to the bass note* change and thus change the "quality" of the sound to make it match other things we are *very* familiar with and define/categorize as other things.

But, we should realize while this is a pretty powerful effect, the same can be said about many other things.

For example, one of my teachers early on played a bunch of C and G notes on the piano then played 1 Eb. His point: It only takes one 3rd to really tell us whether the chord is major or minor.

And we can also take the example of adding 7ths - if you take a triad progression, and add a line at the 7th, we'll hear those as different chords too.

And, if you did something like the following:

G - D - F# - Eb

C - G - B - Ab

with a static Bb over top, we're going to hear those as Cm7, Gm, BMaj7, and Abadd9 most likely.

And if we reverse your example, and play a static bass line with moving chords on top, playing A - C#m/A is going to sound like you changed the A to Amaj7.

So it's not just the bass line phenomenon but because it's something that happens a lot in pop music people probably notice that one more.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You are not the first person, nor will you likely be the last to attempt this.

I dare say - not to insult you - but it' a bit of a naive pursuit.

Firstly, there has been work done in these fields. You should do research so you're not re-inventing the wheel. Additionally, the computational resources we have available now mean there are people who are able to do this kind of comparison on a scale where meaningful data can be culled, and there are even people out there using AI to teach a computer how to compose - they feed it pieces, which it does all these computational comparisons on, and using that develops probabilities and then can "compose" based on that.

Secondly, it might not be all that helpful - especially if you don't have access to the above and can't get a reasonable sample.

Now, there certainly are dissertations written on things like "chord tropes in modern speed metal" but usually you have to pare down your sample size to something with a lot of common characteristics to show any worthwhile similarities, and then those are often relevant only to that one particular niche. It can be informative for that, but as any "universal" guideline it's pretty useless. In fact, we already have all kinds of <b><u>Harmony</u></b> textbooks that have already done this for us.

RN progressions can be helpful, but again aside from "common patterns" this can tell you very little. Certainly 12 Bar Blues has a consistent enough progression to be "re-taught". Same for the so-called "Axis Progressions" which are the 4 chord permutations from the Axis of Awesome video that showed how many pop songs were the same progression.

When you get into melodies, you're talking a MASSIVE undertaking. And if - as you said yourself - you don't know much about theory yet - the way you are capable of analyzing them now is not going to be of any use later. Do you know the difference between a chord tone and non-chord tone? Is that enough, or will knowing what KIND of non-chord tone it is also be relevant?

Basically you're talking about things like the English Language - we can - and people have, determined frequency of certain letters:

http://letterfrequency.org/

http://letterfrequency.org/word-frequency-english-language/

I mean, think of it this way - if we were to use Keys, there's probably a bell curve that roughly follows the circle of 5ths where C is the most used Key of all time - because it's the one beginners learn first, and the "more advanced keys" are used less commonly.

But that doesn't mean you should or shouldn't write in C.

Same with BPM - there was a study (South American) that took hit songs and graphed their BPM and found that something like 120 BPM was the average or something like that. Now, with the prevalance of DAWs and the untrained "musicians" who use them, they don't even  know they can set the tempo to anything different, so there's a preponderance of 120 BPM (the default - which also leads people to believe mistakenly it's somehow "the standard").

But still, extremely slow or fast pieces are a rarity anyway, so there's going to a bell curve to average tempos anyway.

But I think we can say, there are trend-followers and trend-setters. Statistical analysis can tell you the trends, and either what to follow, or what to ignore in order to be different, but you know, if you simply learn to play a lot of the songs you like, this all becomes abundantly clear without having to do all that tabulating.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, I think you're being confused...

If we're talking about 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> for example, pretty much each chord voice-leads into the next. It's a non-issue in this context.

What we're really talking about here is a Common Chord Modulation (sometimes called Pivot Chord Modulation) where the chord is a Secondary in one key, and diatonic in the other (typically it's secondary in the original key, diatonic in the second).

C - D#o7 - Em - let's assume it's an actual Modulation rather than just a Tonicization.

If one key is C, and the other is Em, then the D#^o7 is vii^o7 /iii in the original key, and just vii^o7 in the other.

Done. Walk away. No need to use fancy words like "chromatic" and so on. No need to have any "preparation" chords - the B^o is no less in the key of C than the C chord it. It could be C - C#^o7 - Dm, or C - F#^o7 - G - again assuming they're actual modulations.

It is in the broad family of "chromatic <b><u>harmony</u></b>" to the first key, but more specifically a Secondary Dominant (and more specifically, a Secondary Leading Tone) as well.

You can have Common Chord Modulations where the pivot chord is common to both keys, only one key, or neither key.

You could go from C to A, by using B7 - which is V7/iii in C and V7/V in A.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I can't watch the vid right now because YT freezes on the computer where I am.

Kostka/Payne have a pretty good "explanation" of Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in their "Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" text (at least, it was there in the editions I knew).

They rolled a 6-sided die and wrote a chord progression based on the numbers that came up, using the chords I - vi.

I'm going to bet they probably actually did it a couple of times to get one that sounded as non-functional as they could, or that didn't have too many of the same number come up, etc. but the result was in the text.

Basically, it "sounds wrong". It doesn't "lead to" the Tonic.

Then they give an example of "functional progression" where it sounds as we expect and does lead to the tonic.

Everything before Tonality was "non-functional". Most everything since is actually non-functional as well, or at best, some things are "quasi-funcitonal".

But that is using "Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" in the strict definition of CPP Tonality and in that context.

We could say for example that a "linear" progression has a type of "function" as do sequential progressions and planing.

They all "set up expectations" of where the <b><u>harmony</u></b> will ultimately resolve.

So in the broader sense of the word, yes they're "functional" in SOME teleological aspect.

But in terms of Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> as used in relation to CPP music, they don't meet that definition. And that's what most people mean when they use the words (though they might not actually apply it to the right thing!)


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Accompaniment?

There aren't really pieces of music that only use <b><u>harmony</u></b>. The only such things are basically "backing tracks" - these things people "compose" which is a series of chords with a drum beat and a bass line.

It's kind of like writing a novel, and saying "it was late June, 1923, and the air was hot and sticky in Charleston".

It's a "setting" and may contain elements like "the mood" or "vibe" of the setting, but it has no characters. No points of interest.

Furthermore, as someone has already pointed out, we tend to hear SOMETHING as "melodic".

For example, even with Bach's Chorales, which are "just a bunch of chords" as a simplification, we still hear the uppermost voice as a melody - in fact in that kind of writing it's really 4 melodies that go together, rather than vertical chords, but the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is resultant of the melodies.

But even if we go pure chordal, there tend to be "resultatant melodies" - either the highest voice, the lowest voice, or even just the overall general shape (melodic contour) of the chord progression.

I mean I know plenty of instrumental sections in rock songs where it's "just" chord progressions - but what we as listeners tend to do is to hear the "shape" of the chord progression - high, low, and its rhythm, and consolidate all of the notes into a single "melodic complex".

A piece that is primarily chordal is just that - Chordal.

How do you make it interesting? Add a melody!

Or, make sure the upper note is perceived as a melody.

There are passages in music where a cool chord is repeated over and over again, like the famous Augers of Spring chord in Stravinksy's Rite of Spring, where it's basically just this accented chord that repeats in a seemingly random fashion. With something like that, it can sort of become a game with the listener - trying to predict when the next hit will hit. But that kind of stuff is difficult to sustain for 2 or 3 minutes.

The beginning of one of Wagner's Operas has an Eb chord for like 200 measures or something - 2 or 3 minutes or more. But interest is maintained by the changing orchestration which causes the chord to "shimmer".

But of course if you were seeing the Opera you probably would have scenery to look at and maybe even some action on stage. It also serves the practical purpose of getting people into their seats and settled down.

So the real key here is INTEREST - and interest is generally maintained by change. But of course there needs to be a balance between change and repetition. Too much change can sound frenetic, while too little is boring.

Most people that write a "song" that doesn't have a melody, tend to either just loop a chord progression and it's boring after the 3rd time, or they think that by changing every chord every time it'll make it interesting - when it really makes it confusing.

Striking the balance between change and stasis is not unlike the balance between Melody and <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. Now we kind of expect our melodies to have <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and harmonies to have melody - and too much of either one by itself sounds "incomplete" as far as most musical expectations go.

We can certainly find examples that might fit the bill, but they tend to be rarer than the bulk of music most of us want to make.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;An understanding of the term frequency already assumes a logarithmic containment and logarithmic definition of a number which is geometry and which is irrational.

This is not music theory. It's Acoustics. 

&gt;A logarithm assumes an irrational number as a geometric mean “containment”.

This is math. Not music theory.

None of this has anything to do with music. It has to do with SOUND.

Sure, music is made of sounds, but you don't really have to know the tensile strength of steel to make music on a guitar. In fact, you don't even have to know how mass and tension and length are related. It's pretty obvious that the pitch goes up if you tighten the string. Sure there's some math that explains WHY the pitch goes up when you tighten a string, and can even define or predict how much it will go up.

But it does you no good to have a string that is 4 Hz low, and knowing how to calculate exactly how much tension you will need to add based on the string length, diameter, mass, humidity, temperature, amount the neck will flex to compensate and the logarithmic difference between 20 and 24 Hz, and 6,000 ad 6,004 Hz.

Because the ONLY way you have to practically measure the tension is by the resulting pitch increase. It's flat, you tune it up to the right note. All that other stuff be damned. It happens "in the background" and is unimportant for the act of music-making. In fact, once we're done tuning, that bit becomes irrelevant as it turns into WHEN you play the notes and in what order, versus any mathematical explanations of why X pitch is higher than W pitch.

Do you know all your pitches? Do you know how to read music? Do you know your clefs, and key signatures? What about Major and Minor Keys and Scales? Do you know your intervals? Your Chords? Time Signatures? Rhythmic Values? Phrases, Cadences, Periods, Musical Form? Part-Wrting, Chordal Analysis? Non-Chord Tones? Diatonic versus Chromatic <b><u>Harmony</u></b>?

If you are interested in Music Theory, then THOSE are the the things you should learn. And those are really just the "fundamentals". 99% of the people out there who THINK they know music theory don't even know what Non-Chord Tones are. And worse, they think that Acoustics is "music theory".

If you're interested in Acoustics, fine.

But if you're interested in Music Theory, you should never even trouble yourself with words like "Overtone" or "Harmonic" until you've mastered all of the things listed above.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So do you mean like SOLO flute, or Flute with piano accompaniment, Clarinet Sonatas, or things like that?

The solo pieces by Berio are cool (Sequenzas) and I've always loved Varese's "Density 21.5"

As for wind groups or solo wind with piano, anything by Bozza is great as are all the Poulenc Sonatas for each thing.

IIRC, Hindemith also did a similar thing but I find them harder to appreciate.

I'm not crazy about the whole Pagannini kind of virtuoso solo or solo w/piano or anything that's been arranged that way (James Galway plays yet another transcription for flute and piano that really didn't need to be made).

I'm also not as crazy about the things like the Bach solo things - Partita, Suite etc. for unaccompanied Violin or Cello.

But I do think many of the Flute ones (Transverse Flute or Recorder) played on original instruments can be fascinating in the way the harmonies are kind of "mapped out" by the melodic line.

But with that I feel it might as well be Trumpet, or Violin, or Kazoo because it's less about being idiomatic for the instrument and more about writing the implied <b><u>harmony</u></b> in a single line piece (some of them are of course idiomatic, but winds were of course still being developed at the time)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; But if I'm understanding your post properly, you're saying that the reason for jazz analysis being more complicated and naming these extensions is an informal way of ensuring the improvisor is creating the intended richness of <b><u>harmony</u></b> or ensuring the use chromatic notes where you normally wouldn't if it labeled only by the scale degree it was built on?

Pretty much. Or we might say, it provides more informative guidelines for the improviser.

I think it will help you - and I'm assuming this becuase it's not obvious to me from your response so forgive the assumption - if you think more about KEYS.

Above, you said, you "do this to an extreme degree...understand why notes were chosen..."

So, far and away, notes in melodies are chosen becuase of the KEY, not the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Another thing that has happened with the "oversimplification" of music - and again, not necessarily "wrong" but a practical thing for improv that has been "misinterpreted" and used as a compositonal tool - is the "melodization of a <b><u>harmony</u></b>".

Again, far and away, <b><u>Harmony</u></b> was a result of melody. <b><u>Harmony</u></b> supports melody. We would "harmonize a melody" and any good composer or songwriter would start with the MELODY first, then harmonize it.

What has happened more recently is that people tend to "melodize a <b><u>harmony</u></b>" - come up with the chord progression first, then "force" a melody to fit. Some great threads here recently - one person asks about which chord tone to use in their melody - based on the chord. So they're making the melody conform to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> rather than the reverse. Another post was about "Hey Ya" by Outkast and the debate about whether the <b><u>Harmony</u></b> was an E Major or E Minor chord. The fact is, it's an E Major chord with a G melody note included, becuase the people writing this music don't know it's "wrong" so they do it becuase it "sounds OK" to them.

But, looking at a melody-driven harmonic structure, you can't have the chords dictate the melody becuase you kind of don't know what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> will be until you finish the melody (that's a bit of an oversimplification too becuase most composers/songwriters beginning with a melody are familiar enough with the harmonic style to have a general idea of what's going to happen).

So you have to fall back on the KEY at that point! Your melody is "in the key of D Major" and THAT is how you "choose your notes". Then, you pick chords to support those notes. You put D-E-F# in the melody, it's not automatically a Dmaj9 or Dadd9 as a Jazz player would analyze it. It's not necessarily a 7th chord (or 6th chord, etc.) as a Jazz player would have it. It could be just plain old D, or Bm and the E is a Non-Chord Tone.

But it iS a KEY tone - or scale tone if you like.

So the E is not selected to "make a 9th coloration" on the I chord. It's melody-first and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> supports the melody with a chord that gets most of the notes (assuming we're not harmonizing every single melody pitch, which does sometimes happen).

Where Jazz gets more complex is it doesn't necessarily stay in any one key for any length of time - some pieces do, but many pieces don't.

So there's more of a balance between "harmonizing a melody" and "melodizing a <b><u>harmony</u></b>" but what I see is this approach of looking everything from a <b><u>harmony</u></b> perspective is less beneficial in the former application. Instead, melody notes are just chose from the key and not all of them are chord tones.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>&gt;Although I've played classical guitar for 15+ years and taken a few private composition classes, when I sit down to start writing I would consider what I come up with to be more akin to pop/rock/edm songwriting than classical composition.

OK, 99.999% of the time people with this problem have it because they're just not simply familiar with enough music (especially classical music) and/or they haven't played enough of it and/or most importantly, they haven't really tried to use it as a model to write their own pieces with.

And a secondary problem we have is, no one wants to write "beginner" music.

I used to teach guitar, and I found that old adage "you can't teach an old dog new tricks" is not wholly true. The old dogs have to be willing to put themselves back in the position of a complete idiot who knows nothing but wants to soak up things like they did when they were 10 years old. That's VERY hard to do becuase as we mature, we can do so many things - we've accomplished so much - it's really really really difficult to go back.

This is especially true with "composing" becuase we often take a decade to become pretty competent on an instrument, but the thinking is, if you start composing you should be as good a writer as you are a player. And really, sorry, no, you've got to start from scratch and take 10 years to get that good (granted, it'll go faster though becuase of your other musical experiences).

Think about how long it may have taken you to learn to play guitar. Especially classical guitar. Now I already knew how to play guitar when I started classical, so I didn't have to spend months in the initial pages of the Carcassi Method. But I did have to learn to fingerpick and do those simple little exercises in the key of C for the first batches of pieces.

I literally have that book right here beside me.

I'm looking at the pages with "Scales, Cadences, Exercises and Pieces".

The "pieces" as such are a Prelude, which consists of simple arpeggiated chords.

Andantino - basically a little ternary piece, with an A section in the Tonic key, and B section in the Dominant with  a layout like

||: A :||: B | A :||

Then there's a Waltz in a Da Capo form with repeats that does the first 2/3 in C and then a section in Am.

Then there are some exercises and an Allegretto in a form similar to the Andantino.

I'm going to guess that, when you started studying Classical guitar - unless you had plenty of training on other instruments, knew how to read music, and already payed other guitars - you couldn't play these. You had to learn how to play them.

Well, you have to learn how to compose them.

How?

1. Learn to play the piece.

2. Figure out "what it consists of" - Melody with bass note implying a chord, with the form mentioned above, etc.

3. Try to write a piece like it.

_______

&gt;I might say what's missing is, for want of a better word, direction - the ability to say "Well this piece is an exploration of X".

Right. What do you think that "Prelude" I just mentioned was? It was an exploration of the chords in the key, and a technique of how to play them, also with sounds (inversions, chord progression) that are standard to the genre (which you learn by playing, listening to, and studying the genre).

In the back of my Carcassi Method book, there are 25 Etudes. An Etude is a study piece, and in the case of classical guitar, many of these are studies based on a particular technique - arpeggio, tremolo, muting, slurring, counterpoint, low note melody and so on.

Your "4 steps" in the post - I suffer from the same thing. And what has helped me is this "exploration of X". Though the way I see it is as "Compositional Technique Etudes" - that is, I write "etudes" or studies, but they're not a particular *instrumental* technique, but a *compositional* technique.

In fact I'm working on touching up the notation for a piece I did for classical guitar that is essentially an "etude" (though I called it a Prelude) where I use Whole Tone scales exclusively. All of the music - all of the melodies and harmonies come from either one Whole Tone Scale or the other.

This helps in number of ways - first, by setting up these "artificial confines" of using the Whole Tone Scale, it means when I want to change chords I just can't change to any old chord. It'll have to be one possible from the WTS. And while that may seem "limiting" I want to point out one of the Studies by Carcassi as an example.

There's a particularly beautiful one in F:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM4bJyUZkK0

The piece is VERY consistent throughout. It always has this melody on 1, 3, 4 | 1, 3 with 8th notes in between the melody notes that give the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

The chords are F - C7 - C7 - F for the first 4 bars. The other consistent thing is for each 2 bar phrase, the note on the downbeat of the 2nd measure is always some kind of suspension (there's one that's a retardation - which just resolves up instead of down).

The 2nd half of the first section speeds up the harmonic rhythm in the final phrase, having 2 chords per measure for the last and 2nd to last measures of the section.

The rest of the piece follows this model - it's either 1 chord per measure, with the suspension, with the same melodic idea with one of the two harmonic rhythms (there are a couple measures where the last half has two chords instead of just 1).

And that's it. 

It basically then just goes through some chord changes using this pattern.

So the "compositional technique" if you like is simply plopping this pattern onto a bunch of chord changes. The artistry sort of comes in in which melody notes are chosen and the chord voicings.

I've never considered it a real "study" for guitar in that the technique is not really all that difficult - though of course keeping a singing, legato melody in the upper part through all these changes is not the easiest thing - it's just not crazy tremolo technique or something like that. So it's more of a "musicality etude" than a "technique etude".

But the point is, if you can "exploit" a compositional technique like this, it's 100% OK to write a "simplistic", short, "study piece".

And I think you'll find that if you "limit" yourself to something like this - eliminating all of the other variables that will drive you crazy choosing between which will fit and which don't - this automatically gives you "consistency" and lets you concentrate on the musicality and artistry.

So my suggestion is to take some short pieces like this, maybe refresh them by playing through them, and then look at "what the piece is "about" " compositionally, and then take an idea like that, use the piece as a model (hell you can even steal the chord progression!) and try to make your own "study after Carcassi". You can analyze them in detail, or in broad strokes like I did. 

It helps to find something that's "consistent" like the patterns in this piece to begin with. Because the more things that are "givens", the more you can "accept them" and not have to try so hard at being "unique" and can get on to the more important aspects of "musicality".

I think once you do this, you'll realize A: a LOT of music is actually constructed this way and is often VERY consistent in the material it uses - "repetitive" almost -and B: You won't be beating yourself up for doing the same thing.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;why an artist would choose a E in the melody over say a G if the chord were, say, Dmaj at that time.

They liked the sound of it. We'd have to ask them!

You do have to watch out for one thing though: it is in common in Jazz circles to talk about things like "avoid tones". Once such avoid tone is the 11th - you generally, on a Major chord, don't use the diatonic 11th because it clashes with the 3rd of the chord.

The problem is, people take that WAY too literally and do things like either just not play the G, or feel like they need to always play Lydian over a I chord or something like that.

The truth is, a G note over a D chord can sound fine in most applications. Historically it would have appeared as a passing tone between two chord tones, a neighbor tone to a chord tone, a suspension that resolves to a chord tone, and so on. So keeping with the theme here - not everything is a chord tone - if it's a chordal 11th, fine, you might want to omit the 3rd from the chord, or raise it.

But if it's just a simple melody note, no reason to get into all that crap. If it sounds good, play it.

I'm not quite sure what you're asking about harmonizing a melody because you start talking about counterpoint and two voices.

It really is a balance of chord tones and NCTs.

I think what you might be asking is if two parts both have NCTs at the same time:

E - D - E

C - B - C

Say this was all a C chord. The D and B don't necessarily imply a new chord. Context would be important - how long they sounded for, if anything else in the piece was similar and did imply a <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and so on.

And it really is context driven.

For example:

E - D - C

G - G# - A

will likely be heard as Em - E7 - Am in an Em or Am context. That G# and D might both be non-chord tones in many contexts, but in this context they take on the functional role of making a secondary dominant sound that then resolves where it should. So even in the key of C Major this could sound like I or iii moving to V7/vi to vi (I say E7 here even though no E is present because the previous chord sets it up - so technically we could say vii^o but since those don't typically happen in root position we can say this is "operating like" a V7/vi even if it doesn't spell the chord exactly).


What I'm talking about more generally is taking a melody like:

C - D - E - C - F - E - D - - -

And harmonizing it:

C - C - C - C - F - F - G7 - G7

or

C - C - Am - Am - Dm - Dm- G7 - G7

The D in the first measure and the E in the second are both non chord tones.

But calling this:

C - Cadd9 - C - C for the first measure, or - Cadd9 - Cadd9 - Cadd9 - Cadd9 for the whole measure is seeing it the wrong way IMHO.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Chords can sort of come in two broad varieties:

Chords can be resultant of independent  melody lines - I think this is what you're talking about when you say "voices".

But chords can also be "independent entities" that are made by stacks of notes.

IOW, if you have a Bach Chorale, you've got four independent melodies that come together to create a resultant <b><u>harmony</u></b>. That stems from Counterpoint.

But if you have a Mozart Piano Sonata, you may have a Melody on top, with a chordal accompaniment.

So at the extremes, you're looking at linear motion that combines to make chords, or just purely vertical chords.

But, a piece of music can actually fall at any point along that spectrum - lots of grey area in between those two extremes.

Your description of "harmonic checkpoints" is apt, but I think we're dealing with words instead of examples here, so it's going to be hard to be clearer.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Historically, people "harmonized a melody" rather than "melodized a <b><u>harmony</u></b>".

There are a few historical examples of the latter - variation forms like T&amp;V, or Divisions, or Ground Bass forms, or ostinati forms would naturally come up with a harmonic progression first (and in many cases, use a pre-existing one, just like Bach used pre-existing Melodies when harmonizing in a chorale setting).

But by and large, most music is "melody-driven".

I should note though, that most "melody-driven" composition is still done within in a framework of standardized harmonic moves that composers are familiar with. So while we might say the "melody came first, then <b><u>harmony</u></b> was added" the composer had an intimate understanding that at the end of their melodic phrase, they'd likely end on a Half Cadence or Imperfect Authentic Cadence and would write their melody accordingly. They also were really familiar with what types of harmonic moves would work within a particular melodic gesture.

So it's not like they were "flying blind" so to speak.

So melodic ideas were conceived within a known "melodic-harmonic complex" and it wasn't just "trying things until you got something that sounded good".

"melodizing a <b><u>harmony</u></b>" is commonplace now. Maybe unfortunately. But it is the way it is. Again, it's not without precedent. But let's say, my opinion (YMMV) is that "harmonizing a melody" is something that involves a level of craftsmanship that isn't generally seen in "melodizing a <b><u>harmony</u></b>".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>They don't apply and you'd be better off to forget about them. The Harmonic Series creates TIMBRE or "tone quality".

It's what makes a Clarinet sound like a Clarinet and not a Flute. If you have a Clarinet and Flute play the exact same note (frequency) at the exact same volume (amplitude) then the Clarinet will sound like a Clarinet and not the Flute.

The reason is, when you excite the air column in a Flute, the entire length of the air column vibrates, and then that length of air also subdivides into some smaller portions (like 2 halves) that vibrate as well.

When you do the same in a Clarinet, the same is true, except that there are MANY MORE subdivisions of the air column that vibrate, and produce "overtones" that "color" the resulting sound - tone color.

"The Harmonic Series" proper is a set of infinite numbers that are related in a specific way. These numbers describe a "perfect state" for various physical things, such as vibration in metals. It so happens that sound, being vibrations of air, and air being a physical medium that must adhere to the laws of physics, also follows this same pattern.

To comprehend it for musicians, we generally use a string as an example.

When a string that is fixed at both ends is plucked, it will give a "fundamental" frequency - the number of times it vibrates in seconds, which we use Hertz (Hz) as the unit of measure.

But, because of this physical thing, the string not only vibrates its full length, but it vibrates in halves, and in 3rds, and 4ths, and 5ths, and so on up to infinity.

If we have a fundamental of 100 Hz, halving the string will DOUBLE the frequency, so the first "overtone" is at 200 Hz, which is twice as high and an Octave higher then the first.

When these overtones are in an Integer Ratio - that is, "whole numbers" for non-mathy people - you get Overtones at 2f, 3f, 4f, 5f, 6f, 7,f...nf.

So given a 100 Hz fundamental, we'd expect to see Harmonic Overtones at 200Hz, 300Hz, 400 Hz, 500 Hz up to infinity.

Generally speaking, in this perfect mathematical model, each overtone not only increases in frequency by a whole number ratio, but it DECREASES in amplitude (volume) by the inverse - meaing the 2nd partial is 1/2 the volume, the 3rd partial is 1/3 the volume, and so on.

So what this means is, as the Harmonics get higher in frequency, they get quieter.

Now this is the "perfect mathematical model" and doesn't really happen in nature - or rather, we haven't really built instruments with the desire to reproduce this perfect mathematical model. We can, with Synthesizers, and some do, but most can't do it perfectly exactly. But closer than most other instruments.

So a Flute, does not have all these "Harmonics". It has very few.

A Clarinet doesn't have them all either. It has primarily only the Odd numbered Harmonics - and they fall off at a different rate than just the inverse.

A Violin or Trumpet has probably the closest to the mathematical model, but as you probably know, it's not too difficult to differentiate between those two sounds so the Harmonics for each can't be exactly the same.

For mathematical models that are close to those sounds, we use different waveshapes (which are different shapes because they contain different harmonics in different proporitions) such as Sine, Square, and Sawtooth (and the other famous one, Triangle, which is closer to a French Horn).

Basically, the more harmonics a sound has, the "brighter" it may be, and the fewer it has, the more "mellow" it may be. If you think about it, Trumpet and Violin can be "brassy" or "buzzy" or "zingy" or whatever you want to say, while French Horn is "mellower" (and its waveform also only has the odd harmonics) while Flute can often be called "pure".

So the Harmonics that are present in a sound are responsible for the Tone Quality or Timbre of the sound.

Now, there are a ton of people out there who have allowed themselves to believe that this has, in some way, impacted music. They invoke the Harmonic Series to "prove" faulty theories they have about pretty much everything.

That is likely because the Harmonic Series frequencies can be represented as musical pitches, and often are, so you'll see a chart with something like:

C1 - C2 - G2 - C3 - E3 - G3 - Bb#! - C4 - D4 - E4 - F#4! - G4 - A4! and so on.

This has been called "the chord of nature".

There are many issues with the way people "use" (or think they use) the Harmonic Series or the ways they think it appears in music, but the biggest issue is that, even if these frequencies do in fact occur in a sound (as we've just discussed, not all of them appear in every sound, and I'm not even getting into inharmoniciity, change over time, range of human pitch and volume perception, and so on) even in the perfect model each Harmonic gets quieter. The first one is only HALF as loud as the fundamental.

So we don't really "hear" these individual notes. Due to the Gestalt Effect, our brains don't pick out the individual notes, but hear instead the resultant tone color - all the overtones are subsumed into a single Tone Quality.

Now, that doesn't mean you can't hear them and pick them out if you try hard on a sustained tone. But on the fly, in actual music, no, it doesn't just sound like a bunch of parallel chords moving around.

The "Pattern" in the notes is that the distance between each successive interval gets smaller - notice the first two are an 8ve apart, but the next two, C-G, are only a 5th apart. Then it goes 4th, Major 3rd, minor 3rd - then it gets to interval sizes that we don't use in 12tet tuning (actually all the ones but the octaves are wrong compared to 12 tet) but we get small minor 3rds, large major 2nds, small minor 2nds, then 1/4 steps, then 1/8th steps and so on (which is why the Bb and F# have "!" by them because they're not "in tune" with 12tet and are often pointed out on charts).

Many people will say things like "<b><u>harmony</u></b> arose from the Harmonic series". "The major scale comes from the Harmonic series". "V7 resolves to I because of the Harmonic Series". "Voice your chords like the Harmonic series".

The problem is, if you look at actual music, you'll see that much of what we've done - most of what we've done is in SPITE of the Harmonic Series.

And that's because while it has a LOT to do with Tone Quality, and Acoustics, it has little to do with actual music.

Now, even those who "overestimate" the impact of the HS on music have often been inspired to use it in their own ways which mean - at least since the internet when all this misinformation spread - that there have been actual implementation of principles from the harmonic series in pieces of music. For example, by not using valves on a brass instrument, one can just go up and down the harmonic series for that fundamental by varying embouchure and pressure. So you could "play" the harmonics (essentially producing notes by forcing the air column into the various divisions). And thus, you could write a piece that exploits these. And people doing electronic music do stuff like add and subtract harmonics to change tone colors using timbral change in a way that resembles what we might ordinarily do with pitch.

So let me put it this way:

There is real science behind the Harmonic Series.

However, it's direct impact on the ART of music is not as big as most people make it out to be, and there's a lot of quackery out there trying to prove a relation where none exists.

However, that pursuit in and of itself as produced musical results, informed or not, that can be taken on their own merit as art.

But any time anyone says "because of the harmonic series", you need to investigate further and not just accept that as fact.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; If I create a melody, and then decide which chords to harmonize it with after I can simply create a new melody, bass or whatever, with that progression in mind and it should work harmoniously.


I'm not sure I follow totally. I'm talking about simply taking 1 melody, and harmonizing it with chords. No additional melodies.

Now, yes, if you create a melody, with a chord progression, yes, you could add a bass line and as long as that follows the chord progression, it should work. Same with any countermelodies or other inner lines and so on that you add.

You could just start with a chord progression, and add a melody, and a bass line, and so on, letting the chord progression dictate what notes the melodies have. But traditionally, we prefer to harmonize a melody rather than "melodize a <b><u>harmony</u></b>".

with the Bach 3 Part, you're talking about counterpoint again which is a different animal. You're back to 3 melodies and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> being RESULTANT of those 3 parts. Many works like this actually do not follow "functional chord progressions" because the melodic motion and counterpoint is more important.

However, functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is descended from contrapuntal practices so counterpoint sort of already generates. It's a very complex subject but basically, like for a final cadence, a composer will typically "break" the counterpoint and sort of "force" a V-I cadence where they want it.

But for an example, let's say you have a line in one part that goes:

A-G-F-E | D

Well, that D naturally lends itself to a V chord.

So that's an ideal place to cadence. That measure the composer would say "I want a V here, so I'll make the melody now go D-C-B-D then on to C for the I chord.

But if it happened in the middle of the phrase they might go, "I'm going to harmonize that D with an F so it doesn't sound like a Dominant at all, and a ii chord instead so I can prolong getting to the Dominant.

Also, a composer would look at the A-G-F-E and say, "well, that could be an Am chord, an F chord, a Dm chord and so on. And then they pick what they want.

If they're doing imitative counterpoint, it's possible the accompanying voice has been dictated by something that happened in another voice, or the composer might want to use an important motive to accompany it, but basically you could have, one for every two notes of that pattern:

C - D so the G and E are non-chord tones, or D-A so the G and E are again, or G-B so the A and E are. But some of those will lead better to the D note in the melody, or if they don't, and the composer wants a particular effect - like the last one - the <b><u>harmony</u></b> might go to C as expected with the D being an accented passing tone.

Luckily, the more notes you have in a measure, the more options you have for harmonizing them, so you can make things "fit" as you want them to. Bach would have been intimately aware of every possibility for most common note combinations because this is all he did all day every day pretty much.

I think it might help you out to look up "Hetrophony", "Monody" and "Polyphony" textures, and contrast "Contrapuntal" pieces with "Melody and Accompaniment" pieces.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Since you've sobered, I was going to say that it's not really a fair question because Haydn's orchestration style changed quite a bit over time - his early symphonies were "string driven" with winds reinforcing the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - but many of his early symphonies only have like one pair of clarinets, or 2 pairs of winds. He doesn't get into that "full orchestra" style like we expect of a typical Symphony until later.

So it should probably be saying "mature" style for Haydn.

That said, it may be really getting at what the Orchestration style between a Classical and Impressionistic piece would be.

And you know, even with Debussy, the orchestra used in Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun is different from La Mer ...

So really this is one of those kinds of questions where, what you really need to know is what the instructor wants you to say! Hopefully you have the study notes!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>When I see piano chords voiced like this I'm always a bit concerned.

Do you play piano? Are you able to play this?

Usually, a Sonatina is not only a shorter piece than a Sonata movement, but it's also usually lighter in character.

You don't have to do that of course, but these "thick" piano chords can be kind of "ponderous" and if that's not what you want, they could be counterproductive.

When I would do something like this, I would always go back and say "do all of these notes REALLY need to be here?"

If the answer was yes, then then I'd keep them. But very often, a "less is more" approach would be better. You can get the same chord yet "thin it out" so you're changing density, not <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Those LH chords with the 3rd at the bottom like in m. 17 and 18 are particularly worth re-investigating IMHO.

Why does the 4th chord in the piece have an F# in it? It should be a Gb.

The section with the low LH triplets - again - I'm not really sure if that's what you want. There's no reason why most of it couldn't be up an octave (and typically is in those kinds of passages).

That too can be a bit ponderous. And basically, despite the dynamic changes, this makes the whole thing kind of ponderous. Again, OK if that's what you intend, but often it's nice to lighten up the texture. And maybe the reverse could happen - the violin melody at the top is nice - could be cantibile, singing, soaring. That could be accompanied by "less thick" sonorities and maybe even higher voicing. That way, when the low triplets enter, it's that much more of an aggressive gesture. IOW, you're kind of "stealing the thunder" from the triplet section by kind of already beating us over the head with these low chords initially.

If you can't play it, you should find someone who can and get a reading - that will give you a much better idea of if the sound you expect is the sound you get!

Record it so you can go back and listen.

Wouldn't hurt to post it on a piano forum and see what kind of comments you get.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I have to agree 100% with u/BlockComposition here.

Giving advice on pieces like this is kind of tough, because you want someone to stay excited about writing, but I'd hate it to sound like "every thing you did was wrong".

Also, sorry you haven't been feeling well. 

You're right, you do have to start somewhere.

First, I'd say, you called it "for Piano, Violin, and Cello" but you have extra violins in there.

Let me throw out some general ideas here:

1. Avoid writing triads like that for Piano LH aside from a "special effect", especially when the triads are very low. You could either move it up, or just play the open 5th or octave, or for a little more power, octave and 5th. If you really need the 3rd in the chord, middle C could be played before the RH pattern starts by the RH. Once the RH pattern starts, you could still play the C whole note with the RH, having it hold while the F and Db continue above, with a single Ab, Ab octave, Ab and Eb 5th or Ab-Eb-Ab voicing below. IOW, get that C up an octave or don't use it depending on the sound you want.

2. Your lowest violin staff appears to be just doubling the main violin an 8ve down. Not sure why you included that (maybe to get a better sound out of the software) but not only is in unnecessary, it's getting mucked up with the piano register, and it goes way too low for a violin to play. It doesn't really do anything special, so just get rid of it.

3. The Cello really should act like your Bass in texture like this. It doesn't always have to take that role, but that's really the foundation of what it does. If you look at early Piano Trios by Haydn, the Cello really just doubles the bass part in the piano. What you could do here is drop the Cello to the low Ab when the piano comes in, and that gives the piano LH the freedom not to have to play that low Ab note and lets you get that triad up higher - so you could play Eb-Ab-C from the bottom up (or just Eb - C or Ab - C - or just C! etc.), with the cello doing the low Ab (or the Cello could just double the low Ab in any of the examples I gave above.

4. The other low violin also doesn't seem to have any reason for being there. Again, it's just kind of mucking up the texture - making it unnecessarily busy and detracting from the other lines.

5. So go for "clarity". You need a Melody Line (Violin), a Bass that supports it (Cello), and something to make <b><u>Harmony</u></b> (Piano). I agree that you could also learn a little more about melodic and harmonic motion, which comes from playing and studying other pieces and basically, stealing ideas. I like this idea you have of a melody against this repeating motif in the piano, and that's a good basis on its own for a piece (or a section of a piece). Don't feel that the Piano always has to use both hands. It would be totally OK for the piano just to go F-F-Db-Db-F-F-Db-Db, the cello to take a low Ab, and the violin to play the melody. You could give the piano just a low Ab, and have the cello do the F-F-Db-Db idea. It's OK to be "sparse" like this. Especially when you're starting. You want clear ideas you can hear and work with, rather than throwing notes on the page, playing it back, and saying "I guess that sounds OK". Instead, don't throw a note on the page until you have a good reason to do so. "What does this next measure need? - I know, a "bang" - what will give me a "bang" - a loud clashy chord". BUt think about what you need first, or where you want it to go, rather than just throwing something in and hoping it'll work.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't have the time to transcribe it, but there are some things you need to understand.

The piece stats "in G Minor".

That means, the KEY is G Minor, so the SCALE used is G Minor - at least, primarily.

But, not all of the notes in a piece have to come from the same key.

When a song is in X Key, all or most of the notes come from that key. It may use some notes from other keys, or notes we just call "non-diatonic" or "chromatic" meaning they're just not in the main key. As long as the number of chromatic notes don't outweigh the number of "in key" or Diatonic notes, it'll sound like it's in the main key.

But music can also modulate to other keys, sometimes temporarily, sometimes for extended amounts of time, and so on. There are also "Tonicizations" which also use notes outside of the key briefly.

Gm has the notes:

G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G.

Do you see the first 4 note melody notes in there?

D# is not D#, but Eb. So do you see the Bb A  D Eb part there?

The one with F and F# (which is Gb actually) is a bit tricky as it comes from a different key. But it is possibly to stay in Gm and use a chromatic note within a melody.

It's also not really accurate to ask which scale the melody uses, because a lot of the time EVERYTHING uses the notes from the scale. So the <b><u>harmony</u></b> does as well.

And when the <b><u>harmony</u></b> changes, so too might the melody, as is the case with the 2nd group here.

But, staying with Gm, it's very common in a Minor key to use a Major V chord instead of the diatonic v chord. This means that a D chord would be D-F#-A instead of D-F-A.

In that case, it's still considered part of Gm but if we use that <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, any melodies will also use the F# instead of the F.

Because a lot of music does use chromatic notes, notes from other keys, and so on, it is often not practical (or even possible) to pick one scale for the whole piece, a section, or even a phrase.

And it is really the wrong way to look at music - especially music like this, or any Classical music etc. A lot of "pop" or "folk" music might be made with a particular scale (but still notes from the key usually) but you can just tick off the melody notes in order, then arrange them alphabetically, and have the scale of the piece.

Music is primarily based in Keys, not scales. You need to understand Keys - which affect not only melody but <b><u>harmony</u></b> as well - to understand how pieces like this are constructed and how to emulate them.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK,

The Circle of 5ths tells you two things:

1. What the Key Signatures are for all keys that use Key Signatures.

2. How each of those Keys are related to each other in a 5th relation.

A LOT (way too many) of people misunderstand that the "Circle of 5ths" is a "chord progression" and it is not. It has nothing to do with chord progressions at all. It is simply a diagram that points out how Keys can be organized in 5ths, and when that is done, the Key Signatures themselves follow a specific pattern of adding or subtracting accidentals.

When you write music in a Key (or play music in a Key), the vast majority (if not all) of the notes and chords will come from the Key.

So if you look at the Key Sig for Eb Major, it has 3 Flats: Bb, Eb, and Ab.

This tells you the notes of the scale are:

Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D - (Eb).

It also tells you any chords made will use those notes.

All of your <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melodies for the piece should be drawn from this collection, or at least focus heavily on them.

It also tells you when notes and harmonies are NOT in the key of course. Generally speaking, music in a key focuses on notes/chords in the key - too many out of key notes/chords will sound like we're not in the key anymore, or some other key.

Your question is worded a little funny, as they don't really "affect" anything.

By that I mean, really, there's not really any difference between F Major and G Major. One is just a bit higher. But the inner relationships between all the notes and chords within each of those keys is the same within the key. The distance from F to the 3rd note of the scale is the same distance as it is from G to the 3rd note of it's scale.

Think if you measured 1 Inch (or cm, whatever) on a ruler. If you put the 0 mark on the beginning of a 1 inch block, it's going to come out at 1 at the other end. But you could put the block on 5, and it would reach to 6. It's still an inch long, it's just "transposed" to a different starting number.

Keys are like that - all the Major scales are the same internal relationships. They just start higher or lower.

This is useful for many things - vocal ranges, instrumental ranges. On some instruments, like Guitar, playing in Em will give you lots of open strings in your chords if you want. But you can't do that in Fm, which will give a different sound. So sometimes people write in keys that are specifically suited to particular instruments, or to produce a certain sound on specific instruments. 

but why keys are important is because most of the music most people are interested in playing or writing is Key-based, or, highly influenced by Key "thinking".

When improvising, knowing the key helps you know what notes to pick. When composing music, understanding keys helps you know how to get "in key" sounds if that's what you want, or not.

There are a lot of "concepts" that go along with keys - Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, Tendency Tones, Heirarchy, and Tonality. All these sort of have mostly to do with "relationships" amongst notes and harmonies.

Since ALL Major Keys exhibit the same relationships, it means that you can transpose them freely and still get the same "effect" if you want.

It's a pretty in-depth topic, so it might help to break down the question and re-frame it.

But the short answer is, you need to know your keys because most music is made from keys and if you don't know them, you're never going to fully understand most music.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yeah - broad. Why "root movement"?

The best overview I can give - as briefly as possible, is that we often talk about "root movement" in musical styles where we use harmonies that are "root based" (traditional tertian chords) as a means to simply describe the sonorities in a general way, rather than talking about specific voicings or part-writing, etc.

In Renaissance Music, there was a more equal distribution of Root Movement from <b><u>harmony</u></b> to <b><u>harmony</u></b> (though the system was not necessarily "root based" so it can be a bit of a stretch analyzing it this way, but it was in a state of flux).

So you are likely to see Root Movement of a 2nd in either direction, a 3rd in either direction, or a 4th in either direction (the rest being inversions of those directions).

In the Tonal Era, or Common Practice Period (the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods), a preference seems to have developed for only the "ascending" progressions, which are 4th Up, 3rd Down, and 2nd Up. This is essentially what "progression" (in the stricter sense of progressing towards the tonic as goal) is and what "creates" if you like, Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

Since the Tonal Era, there hasn't been any real common practices that were widespread. A lot of music still follows Tonal functional tradition.

However, there are certainly some trends in contemporary music that are worth pointing out (and studying, and describing, and writing texts on IMHO).

A LOT of rock music - especially any "blues informed" rock music - will often use chord progressions based on the roots of a Pentatonic Minor scale (or even Pentatonic Minor Blues scale). We might call these "scale-based progressions" or something similar.

Seeing a progression like C - Eb - F - Bb or any kinds of variants using C - Eb - F, or C - Eb - Bb, C - Bb - Eb, C - F - Eb, and so on - including G chords as well as even Gb/F# chords is not uncommon.

Since these are all Major triads (or are all often a similar structure such as a Dom 7th chord) they kind of get lumped in with Planing (Parallelism) and "Constant Structure <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" (more of a Jazz term) but what is important IMHO is that the roots of the chords are based on some scalar structure.

This process is not limited to Pentatonic Scales in rock and can be Hexatonic of even the full scale, or in more experimental music, Whole Tone Scales and so on. "Dock of the Bay" is a classic example, that uses G - A - B - C and E. Not really a Pentatonic (and not in order here) in the traditional sense, but scale tones of G Major (the primary key).

The chords don't have to be of constant structure as many songs use progressions that remain diatonic to the key, but it's not uncommon to play a non-diminished chord on any 7 scale degree, and it's not uncommon to avoid any diminished chord degree altogether, making for a lot of hexatonic progressions, or still using Pentatonic roots (like Cm - Eb - Fm which is diatonic, but clearly not a traditional functional chord progression).

We might say that modern pop steps away from classical and actual shows a preference for the "descending" progressions of 4th DOWN, 3rd UP, and 2nd DOWN. But, since there's enough music that is still tonal based, we end up with a system that's more similar to the Renaissance. However, it seems to be more "piece based" or at least "style based" and the two are more or less "both used but as opposites" instead of all just being part of the overarching trend.

I haven't seen much writing about the modern popular music types of "scale based progressions".

Most people never encounter the "Ascending" and "Descending" progressions concept - I saw it in a Thesis that compared root movement in Bach with root movement in Palestrina or something of that nature, essentially showing what I said above - as we approach functionality, there's a trend towards the Ascending progressions being used. I've looked for it since and haven't been able to find it unfortunately.

As for the Wagner - yes, in the later Romantic Period, as different, less functional root movement is being explored, yet another way to generate root movement (unlike scalar versions in rock/pop music) is symmetrical movement - keys like C - Ab - E - C, or C - Eb - F# - A.

I should note though that this if often KEY movement, not necessarily chordal progressions. So it's on a different scale. Still, seems to fall within the same general concept.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Do chord changes almost always happen on strong beats like every 1/2 bar, 1 bar, 2 bars etc. ?

In boring, lame, uninteresting music, yes. Ok, I kid. Well, maybe I don't kid...

Seriously though, yes, very often the chords change regularly. One thing that often happens in classical music at least is that the harmonic rhythm tends to speed up leading into a cadence (so if it was 1 chord per measure, it may have have 2 chords per measure in the penultimate measure).

&gt;say I want to have a chord progression that lasts two bars,

I don't think this is exactly what you mean.

If you want a SINGLE <b><u>HARMONY</u></b> that lasts for any duration, you need to either hold those notes throughout that duration (2 measures, 10 measures, whatever) or play them in some rhythmically active fashion.

IOW, if you play a C chord on every beat for 2 measures, or hold a C chord for a total of 8 beats (whole notes tied across the bar) which equals 2 measures, the harmonic rhythm is still "1 chord per two measures".

You could even arpeggiate or re-voice the C chord - low on beat 1, high on beat 2 and so on - as long as the <b><u>harmony</u></b> remains a C chord, it's a C chord - there is no new <b><u>harmony</u></b>, so there's no "harmonic rhythm" until the chord changes from C to something different.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Hmmm.

I think, it maybe already sounds "overwhelming" and you don't need to add anymore parts or countermelodies.

Forgetting the orchestration for now, I think this is a common problem where people feel like they need to keep adding stuff and adding stuff - I don't know why - to make it more "complex" or seem "more advanced" or something.

Think about something like Ravel's "Bolero" - it starts with 3 elements that are very clearly laid out for you - the snare drum rhythm, then the bass note pattern - which basically become a "backing ostinato". Then you get the melody.

Of course, the piece builds as it goes, but for example, when the first flute finishes the melody, and the 2nd flute (IIRC) takes over, the first flute just starts playing the same rhythm as the snare drum - becoming a different color added to the ostinato.

So it's not like "more stuff is added" - more parts or countermelodies (at that point). It's just that those 3 initial elements are just presented in different "colors".

It seems like you have 3 unrelated ideas going on. I'm not sure which I'm supposed to be listening to. Is this a Glockenspeil feature, with the Clarinet and Oboe just providing harmonic support, and later the Bass providing foundation?

The Oboe has a pretty nice melody. I like how you sort of expand it. But it does basically use the same "core" idea over and over in the various permutations, so yes, that's kind of repetitive.

The Oboe and Clarinet are nice together with what they're doing, but then the glock just seems to be doing something random.

Usually, glock is better used as an "effect" - to add sparkle to other parts by doubling them, rather than as what might seem like a "solo" instrument. It's almost like I'm listening to the quasi-ancient-sounding piece, with a fly buzzing around my ear (the glock).

Now granted - some of this is partly due to the sounds of the software - and also why it sounds a bit repetitive (and probably why you feel that way too).

Two solo instrumentalists playing this expressively could sound quite nice.

Looking more in detail at the Oboe and Clarinet - firstly, you put Bb clarinet, but the part is not transposed. That's fine if this is a score "in C" (sometimes called "Concert") but I just want to make sure you know it should be transposed at least on the part (and scores like this should be marked "in C" somewhere).

There's a nice counterpoint going on, but you've got a number of unisons which can kind of counteract what you're going for - especially that one stacatto A in the clarinet.

I think maybe you're seeing the glock part as sort of "filling out the <b><u>harmony</u></b>" but you know, the glock is basically going to be really high and just sound "tinkly" in most cases.

I was just thinking as listening - a Celeste might be more what you want!

At any rate, instrument after instrument enters, until you get to full bore, and the it's kind of everything going all at once. Then you just have them drop out one by one. It's not "wrong" but it's definitely a more "pop" way of building songs - keep adding instruments until your tracks (or staves) are full, then reverse the process.

Instead - from an orchestration standpoint - it would be good to vary the texture.

IMHO, you basically have too many things doing too many different things.

I mean, when Flute 1 takes over the Glock idea from the beginning, rather than giving the Glock something else to do, just drop it out - change of color.

Just looking at page 4, when the 2nd flute enters and everyone's playing you've got about 6 ideas going. The 2 flutes are playing melody in <b><u>harmony</u></b> together. The Oboe and Clarinet seem to be providing a countermelody in <b><u>harmony</u></b>, as well as harmonic support. The Tuba is doing its own thing - in contrast to the DB, which has been doing its own thing since the beginning (yawn - and can contribute to repetitiveness), then the strings are playing chords.

But it seems like all of these ideas are competing for prominence. I can buy the <b><u>harmony</u></b> in the strings, the rhythmic motion in the tuba, and the flutes melody.

But all that other stuff can go. Or, what you can do is lighten the texture for a while by taking them out, but adding them in elsewhere. IOW, you don't have to totally get rid of them, but by adding everything in, once you get everything going - and leaving it that way - yes it's repetitive - and in some ways "unrelenting" that way.

At measure 51 - where you have those big chords moving - that's a wonderful contrast - FINALLY the Glock is doing something different - and a more typical use, and the tuba's idea becomes more important.

Why not, have the double bass double the tuba. 

And remember I was talking about leaving the glock out instead of creating a new idea for it that just clutters up the texture? Well, it would have a LOT more impact if it re-entered here! See, this is a new idea, so new orchestration is fine.

I kind of see what you're going for here - but it's a but fuzzy aurally because there's no "clarity" of your ideas. And again, there may be too many of them - this can create a texture that also sounds repetitive because not only is the orchestration pretty much continuous, but all of these ideas create a fabric where we just see the whole blanket, not the individual threads if that makes sense.

Just to give you an example, towards the end you have this idea where the flutes play 3 notes in <b><u>harmony</u></b> then flute 1 does a little triplet flourish.

If that was a main idea, and the texture was much lighter, they could play it, then the oboe and clarinet could play it, then the first and 2nd violins could play it.

Instead, it's kind of like your strings play chords, your flutes play melody (in <b><u>harmony</u></b> together, which makes it busier and "fuzzier") and the oboe and clarinet are playing the "inner parts" and countermelody (again, fuzzying things up) and they're all doing this all the time.

Going back to Bolero - it's extremely repetitive. It's actually kind of bad composition. You probably would get bored with it in a piano arrangement (at least, more so than the orchestral presentation). But what Ravel does is keep our interest by adding ideas and "coloring" them as he goes, rather than just continuing to add new and seemingly unrelated ideas. Now, he totally builds it all up to a big giant mess, and that's part of the point, but I don't think you're capturing quite the same vibe. And throughout, there are these sinewy melodic ideas we can really follow because of how clearly they're presented. And even though they keep coming back - repetitive - they're orchestrated DIFFERENTLY each time. Yours, instead is more like, once an idea comes in, it stays in, the whole time, on that instrument. The Tuba always (or mostly always) just keeps playing that same idea. The DB really plays the same idea. The glock goes through a few ideas, but the only real "hand off" seems to be the opening glock idea eventually winds up in the flute (with variation).

You have that really nice Oboe idea at the top. Then when the flute comes in with that glock idea, it's really nice too.

Why not have a section of the Oboe idea, leaving out the glock, and just doing Oboe Melody, Clarinet harmonic support (countermelody) and Bass rhythmic and foundation.

Then, repeat it, sort of as you do. But on the repeat, have the Flute take over the Oboe part, and the Viola play the Clarinet part, with the Tuba taking over the DB part.

Then you repeat it again, and maybe it's played only in the strings or something. Or of course you could introduce a new idea and since we really haven't heard the full strings yet, give it to them and drop the winds out for a while.

You shouldn't feel like you always have to give everyone something to do. As a person who got stuck playing Cymbals in orchestra sometimes, I can tell you I've counted 200 measures rest, played one crash, and that was it for the piece. If you played a crash on the downbeat of every measure, the crash in measure 201 would have nowhere near the effect it does. So yeah it kind of sucks to not be able to play all the time, but on the other hand, an orchestra member is typically paid by the hour, not by the note. So they're fine with resting.

What I might do if I were you, is copy and paste a section a bunch of times and then go back and try different instrument combinations for various things and see what you like - save everyone playing all at once for the climax of the piece (not just a broad section in the middle). Use the glock sparingly, as an "effect" or "heightener". You could also just play with muting out parts (or erasing measures). Let the DB drop out for 4, 8, 10 measures or whatever. Let the Tuba drop out for the same, or different set of measures. Try reducing it to just 3 ideas, and having only 3 instruments, 6 instruments, or all instruments play those ideas. What if Flute 1, Oboe, Violin 1, and Glock all play the same melody?

You have some really cool ideas here - I just feel like they're getting covered up. Try a "less is more approach"!

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The "Line Cliche"?

Really, the Line Cliche is more like String of Pearls or the James Bond Theme where you've got a constant <b><u>harmony</u></b> with a chromatic line within it. We'd probably need a consistent chord with chromatic bass to be called this - C - C/B - C/Bb - C/A - C/Ab and so on.

"Lament Bass"

Google and listen to "Dido's Lament" by Henry Purcell.

Also, Bach's Mass in B Minor.

They both used the descending chromatic bass line.

We call that a "Lament Bass" - I'm not sure if the name is a modern coining from the Lament for or even inspired by Purcell's very famous work (which is probably just called an "Aria" and was later titled Dido's Lament as a colloquialism). I guess I could look it up.

But both pieces are "sad sounding" and you'll notice that both of those Sherman songs have a certain melancholy about them as well.

We ought to call it the "DCBL" !

Usually, most people are more familiar with "Chim Chim Cher-ee" (spelling always questionable ;-) so that's what I've heard most people say  "the chim chim cheree progression"!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Beyond the obvious like outlining the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, it seems a lot of the advice out there is "use arpeggios and incorporate the odd scale tone or chromatic note". The problem is, this doesn't really fully explain the sound.

Alright, let's cut to the chase: That "outline the <b><u>harmony</u></b>" kind of advice is:

1. Usually regurgitated by people who don't actually know what they're doing.

2. But does have merit as it is actually used, but usually the explanation given is woefully oversimplified.

Another issue is your own "perception" - don't try to "explain the sound". Just MAKE the sound :-)

And you do that by learning this person's music (or others like that) and just honestly living and breathing that style. It's kind of easy to say "outline the <b><u>harmony</u></b>" - but hell - thousands of players do that. It's not so much WHAT is used, but HOW it's PLAYED that makes the difference.

Now, of course, part of this is your not only getting this music ingrained in your DNA by playing it and listening to it, but in order to faithfully recreate it (with the intent of ultimately using things to create your own music out of this tool kit) you have to dig deeper than just the surface elements. Things like "what scale it is" is a wild goose chase (assuming it's not some exotic scale that lends a particular sound of course).

Phrasing is a HUGE reason some players sound like they do. "Approach" is another - not what notes they use, but when they use them and how they're played when they do.

And that gets into Analysis. It's not enough just to listen to it and play it, but you have to also "pay attention" to what's going on (way beyond scales and chords). It's also helpful if you know music by others so you can do a comparative analysis - what this person does, that this other person does differently.

There are absolutely "cliches" that are part of many styles and learning those (that's the vocabulary) are essential to copping a particular style. But then you have to get into players' own idiosyncrasies - how they pull those licks together for example.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;I understand that tension and release are the vehicles of <b><u>harmony</u></b> in music.

No, they're not.

They are aspects of SOME musical styles, not all.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's hard to say.

The whole rock style is basically a "<b><u>harmony</u></b> first" kind of writing though.

"Riffs" are a little different and maybe a little more like traditional writing in that very often people come up with a riff in a key where people understand the harmonic implications already.

I've not heard George play this "bluesy" and haven't been following him really since the first Lynch Mob album (am a huge Dokken fan though) but when someone writes a riff like this, they're generally improvising in the scale/key with an understanding that it implies certain harmonies.

So they might start with a "melody" if we can call a riff that. But they may have just said, "let's do a funk jam in E" and then he just improvised over it, until he came up with some ideas he might repeat each time they play it.

I'm talking more about Vocal Melodies, or something like a vocal melody you'd play in an instrumental setting.

There are videos of George Lynch backstage with a mobile recording device and at that time you could hear he was working on songs for what eventually got released on the next album. They are pretty much full blown arrangements that they would then take to Don Dokken and he would write lyrics and melody to.

So it's a chord progression first, or a "riff" first that then leads into some harmonic changes, but the "melody" melody of the song - the vocal melody, is written to an existing chord progression.

And this is very typically have most popular musicians, especially in rock, work.

Songs that are written "melody first" are generally most classical music. Any Bach Chorale starts with a melody (often a pre-existing one) that Bach then Harmonizes. Any Bach Fugue starts with a melodic subject.

It's possible that something like "Renegade" by Styx began as a vocal melody idea where he may have just been "riffing" this little melodic idea. Notice when the band kicks in, the guitar also basically plays the vocal melody, so that might also be an indication that the melody was written first - either on voice or guitar. More "composerly" bands like Queen are probably more likely to come up with melodies or at least bits of melodies before worrying about the chords. But they also worked in the standard "chord progression you add a melody to" manner as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>We just usually say something like "hear". "Audiate" is of course a word, but it's not something most people use - sounds a little too "academic research papery"!

The process of being able to "mentally hear" what you see on paper is one of "internalizing" the sounds.

This is typically done through "ear-training" and "sight singing" and is supplemented by sight reading on instruments, transcribing, and overall just having "good ears".

It takes a lifetime of work - and some people are better at it than others.

As I said, sit down with a Bach Chorale - or whatever multi voice piece you are comfortable playing - even if it's a Duet as Korrun suggested, and play both lines. Then play one, and sing the other. Then switch. Sing along with playing, and leave a part out and sing that part.

Do this many times a day, every day. Also, sometimes make sure you try to sing things you've never seen before. Try singing just the Bass part of some Bach Chorale you've not seen before, then the Tenor line and so on.

Try recording one line on some device, then singing the other line - and build up the <b><u>harmony</u></b> bit by bit.

When you are listening to music, determine the tonic, then what scale degrees they are, and what chord members they are, and so on.

Listen to some 3 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> pieces, and try to transcribe them.

Singing things helps internalize them. That's why sight-singing is considered such an important skill.

If you look at a piece of paper, and the chords are C - Am - F - G - then you should have a t least a general idea of how that sounds. If not, you need to play it about a billion times, and then try singing the root movement, or maybe sing through arpeggiated versions of the chords and so on.

C-E-G-E | C-E-A-E | C-F-A-F | B-D-G-D or


C-E-G-E | A-C-E-C | F-A-C-A | G-B-D-G or whatever helps "get it in your mind's ear".

the more exercises like this you do, and the more you do them, the better you'll get at this.

Stop worrying about this word "audiate" and stop worrying about whether or not you're learning something by hearing it or seeing it or reading it.

And since you can play piano, you can play anything you can't sing at the same time. There's no way around that. Sing each line, play each line, play combinations of every line, and play and sing combinations of one voice part and the rest piano. That's what people do because that's all they can do.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So you're asking about making an arrangement it sounds like.

It partly depends on what the song consists of and then how true you want to stay to the original.

I don't do this often, but I've definitely been stuck performing a song for a full band by myself and having to make a "guitar and voice" arrangement.

It's super basic - chords and melody (and lyrics of course).

But, if there is some important melodic component that wasn't guitar in the original recording, but the song just sounds like me sitting there strumming chords while I'm not singing, then I'll mix those in. I'll also play solos that incorporate chords where I can.

If it were Piano, one could do a lot more stuff - bass line and chords, singing the vocal and possibly playing the vocal line as well, again adding in other musical elements as appropriate.

&gt;In my mind, the chord progression is the most fundamental level, and I am basically stymied when I can't make a cover out of whatever progression I build. I assume that I'm looking at things in a limited way, but I'm not sure how to improve my process.

This is neither doing a cover nor an arrangement.

Maybe the reason your stymied is you're not supposed to be "building" any chord progression at all. That's called "re-harmonization". There are certain tactics for that but I'm not a big fan of re-harmonization in general.

The Melody is THE most important thing, period.

The chord progression is the next most important thing.

If you "re-compose" either, you're essentially no longer "covering" the song anymore - you're making an original composition, or reharmonizing the melody, or making a new melody to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (which is essentially solo improvisation).

So fundamentals for arranging a song for a solo instrument: Melody and <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

You can "embellish" the melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> to a certain degree, but at some point, once either of those elements diverge from the original too much, you're doing something other than just "arranging" the song and are doing some re-composition, or re-harmonization, or improvising "based on" the song's progression, or something of that nature.




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You're mixing some terms here.

In music, there are *phrases* and we have Antecedent and Consequent phrases, which are sometimes compared to a "Question and Answer" relationship.

But the only real concern there is that the Antecedent phrase ends on a weaker cadence than the Consequent phrase and that's it. For example, Ant. phrases will often end on a Half Cadence, or Imperfect Cadence, while the Con. phrase ends on a much stronger Perfect Authentic Cadence.

If you're talking about *Fugue*, there is **Subject** and **Answer**.

How Subjects and Answers begin and end, both in terms of scale degrees and <b><u>harmony</u></b> are important and a complex subject.

See here:

http://www.music.ucsb.edu/faculty/rothfarb/courses/103/subject-answer.html

However, that is for writing Fugues in Barouque and Common Practice Style. You don't HAVE to write in that style and there are modern Fugues which don't even use the concepts of Tonic and Dominant. It's art, you can do what you want. But if you're trying to emulate a particular style, then you should do it like they did.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes. For example, one method is to memorize intervals using songs..oh.wait..I see that's been posted.

That's the WRONG way!

I was taught that way and I just didn't "get it". It wasn't until I was out of college that I actually figured out a better way - a practical way - and that was because I was actually needing to apply it to music I was making.

Now, to be fair, I was a stupid, rebellious kid who though they knew everything and no one could teach me anything. So my instructors probably did try to teach me the right way but I just ignored them.

So, what is the "better" way?

The point of Moveable Do Solfege is so you lean music within a TONAL context.

Just for a quick example: Many people will tell you that the beginning of the Simpsons or "Maria" from West Side Story is a Tritone - 1 to #4 or 1 to b5.

Sure. It is.

But the problem is, you rarely encounter it in that way in any Tonal music.

Far and away, you're going to encounter a tritone between scale degrees 7 and 4 (or 4 and 7).

Ti - Fa or Fa - Ti, not "Do - Fi" or something.

Now, certainly there is non-tonal music out there, and certainly it's a good ability to be able to recognize intervals in isolation outside of the context of a Key - especially if the music is not key based or constantly modulating. But that's not where one should start. 

So another example, "Fa - Mi"

That's 4-3 and you should hear this in the context of a V7-I progression. Others are possible of course but this is a big one in Tonal music. You need to not only understand it as scale degrees 4 and 3, but as chord tones 7th of a V7 and 3 of a I chord.

So you can learn and sing half steps all the time - and you should. You should be able to recognize them in a song and transcribe them.

But, if you hear "Te - La" you should also understand that harmonic underpinning of a V7/IV - IV progression and that those two are acting as if they are Fa-Mi in another key.

IOW, it's "wrong" just to understand intervals in isolation. Instead, they need to be understood withing the tonal context of the Key, which includes both scale and <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Then the whole thing begins to "make sense".

Then you can move on to singing or trying to hear the intervallic relationships in a quartal motive like the beginning of the Star Trek theme, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I.  Generally speaking, when ascending use sharps and if necessary, double sharps, and when descending use flats and double flats, and of course naturals wherever practical.

E# - F# - Fx - G# - A - A# - B - A# - An - G# - Gn - F# - E# - En | D#....

There are 2 exceptions:

"b2" in minor is often spelled as such even ascending, so here for example, the Fx could be Gn instead.

In minor keys, when descending, scale degrees 6 and 7 are usually spelled like they are in ascending melodic minor, so for example, F#m going down is:

F# - E# - En - D# - Dn - C# rather than F# - Fn - E - Eb - D - C#.

II. Note that the A above is not spelled as G# - because A is already in the key signature of F#m. But if it were F# Major, we'd use #2 instead.

C Major:

C - C# - D - **D#** - E - F - F# - G - **G#** - A - **A#** - B - C

C - B - Bb - A - Ab - G - Gb - F - E - Eb - D - Db - C

C Minor:

C - C# (or Db) - D - **Eb** - En - F - F# - G - **Ab** - An - **Bb** - B - C

C - Bn - Bb - An - Ab - G - Gb - F - En - Eb - D - Db - C

Note the similarity going down - it will just take accidentals in the minor key version.

**So where practical, stick with the Key or Key Signature.**

If it were B Major, descending, it would be:

B - A# - An - G# - Gn - F# - Fn - E - D# - Dn - C# - Cn - B

1 - 7 - b7 - 6 - b7 - 5 - b5 - 4 - 3 - b3 - 2 - b2 - 1

However, that also means the following:

III. If the piece has modulated, or there is a non-diatonic chord, or chord that points to another key, the chromatic spelling from that key should be used. Or as a general rule, make sure the accidentals in the chord and the run agree. If the chord is V7/IV in C - C7, it would contain a Bb, not an A# even ascending, because that would be like scale degree 4 in F.

I'm looking at a run in some Chopin, which is in the key of C Major, on a C chord that is spelled as follows:

Eb - D - C# - Cn - B - Bb - A - Ab - G# - G - F# - E - D# - Dn - C# - Cn - B - Bb - A - Ab - G - 

Which looks weird at first, but here's why:

Eb is going down chromatically to D, so even in C major, that's Eb to D.

C# is kind of odd - could have been Db, but:

C-B-Bb-A- is the typical descent in C or Cm - but then it switches to sharps - G# - Gn - F# - E

So once you really see what's going on here, it's going from b2 down to 5 in D minor, with the b6 of Dm like the b2 of Am, which then goes to Em - or they key of E as the <b><u>HARMONY</u></b> CHANGES to an E chord!

So the accidentals are being adjusted "functionally" as if it's a chord progression even though the piece is in C and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> at the beginning of the measure is a C. The accidentals change to reflect the harmonic changes, rather than just be "all flats" like they "should" have been.

Final note: since you're dealing with transposing instruments, obviously it has to be from the instrument's persepctive, not from the overall key/<b><u>harmony</u></b>.

HTH










</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>u/Jongtr is right on as usual.

What makes traditional minor "minor" is that it pretty much always uses a Major Dominant chord - "V", and Leading Tone chord - "vii^o " as functional chords to lead to the Tonic.

In classical music circles, the minor dominant chord "v" is even called "the modal dominant" by many authors.

bVII is a bit trickier because it's a little more common in classical music, but it tends to act more as V/bIII than it does a "true" bVII chord.

But that means, if you use v and bVII pretty much exclusively, it's not "proper traditional minor".

Now, a couple of caveats here:

1. Many people don't even know about modes and are so indoctrinated into the Major/minor system that they won't even comprehend this as being anything different than "minor".

2. Many people who do know about modes don't know about traditional minor and will assume it's Aeolian even if it is traditional minor.

3. We're almost better off to call the current thing something different, like "Modern Minor" which is really in practice a combination of ideas from both traditional minor and a "modern Aeolian mode".

4. FWIW, actually, in olden days, all the modes except Phrygian altered their penultimate chords to be what we'd call a vii^o or "rootless V7" chord - which eventually did become V7 in any of the minor modes. So the "traditional minor" really evolved from that. So the modern use of the modes in their "purer" form is actually not "traditional" for modes either (at least, not without going way way back in time).

5. IMHO, since the only way to tell Ionian and Major apart are whether it's Tonal Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> or not, the same should be applied to Minor and Aeolian. But we really need some better terminology for this.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>We usually type 6/4 and 4/3 in text-based communication. Books often write out "six-four".

The simple answer - though probably not the answer you want - is that that's just the way it evolved.

The problem with questions like this is you have to look at a very long evolutionary process. Most of us know these chords and inversions from Common Practice Period music but their origins are much older, and in some ways, lost to time.

I don't know if you've done this in analysis, but some texts go so far as to say when you have something like I - IV6/4 - I that you should put the IV chord in parentheses because of it's weak harmonic function.

IOW, it's NOT REALLY A CHORD AT ALL! It is, instead a "happenstance" - a <b><u>harmony</u></b> that is resultant of non-chord tone motion (which can be dissonant or consonant) so it's *really* just a decorated C chord.

In many cases, a cadential I6/4 is not even written as such and merely written as "V" with the 6-5 and 4-3 motion added to the Roman Numerals. This is to highlight yet again that the I6/4 is "not really a real chord" but is instead simply the result of non-chord tone motion and the chord is "really" a V chord being decorated/delayed.

Our problem is, we are so "chord indoctrinated" that we have to see everything that looks like a chord as a chord - but that's not actually the case.

Initially, because of the way counterpoint evolved into "more chordal" ways of thinking, the V4/3 was "not really a true chord".

Instead, it was "resultant of voice leading motion".

Where does one often see V4/3?  Between I and I^6 right?

Think about what happens:

C - B - C

C - D - E

Basic motion for I - I6 filled in with a passing tone and neigbor tone. There's no real chord there, just NCTs.

But, like the IV6/4 example above, we start to get into trouble when we see things that look like chords we're familiar with:

C - B - C

E - F - G

C - D - E

Uh-Oh, - that thing in the middle - which is just simply another Passing Tone, now suddenly looks like something we can give a name to doesn't it? It's a vii^o6 .

But, is it? Really? Or is it the result of passing motion.

What about this:

C - B - C

E - G - G

C - D - E

Is that **really** a V6/4 in there? If it's all a C chord, the G note is just a chord tone. No big deal.

What if you do BOTH?

C - B - C

G - G - G

E - F - G

C - D - E

Is that REALLY a G7 in there? Is it really a V4/3?

One clue that it's not a "functional" 7th chord is that the 7th doesn't resolve!

The "rule" that's really pretty much always adhered to with 7th chords is that the 7th MUST resolve down by step (and many that don't appear to do so are either just delayed or transferred to another voice).

So if a 7th doesn't resolve down, it's not a "true" 7th - and in fact, the reason why is the chord itself might not be a "true" chord! Just like a IV6/4 is not a "true" chord.

To drive home this point, let's take the opposite example of a IV6/4:

G - F# - G

E - D# - E

C - C - C

Now, this thing in the middle looks like a ^o triad right?

But it's not supposed to be in "root position". There's also really no such thing as a "i^o " chord.

Even if we take the spelling literally, as a D#^o7 without the 5th - which though not impossible in 7th chords is rarer in fully diminished 7th chords - what is it?

vii^o 4/2 of iii?

It don't go to iii.

If it's a functional 7th the 7th should resolve down - does it? No.

This chord "makes no sense" and you see people struggle with stuff like this all the time.

The reason is, it's not *really* a chord at all. It's simply a result of NCT motion (note, there is a "ct^o7 " chord that includes scale degree 6 but really that evolved for NCT motion to, though we label it as a chord).

So just becuase something spells a familar triad or 7th chord, doesn't mean it "truly" is, or is functioning as such - and our labelling system for these is inconsistent. We call the V4/3 a "chord" by giving it that name. Parentheses would help as it does for IV6/4, or as in the case of the way some people write cadential 6/4s - no RN for the "chord it would be" at all.

_____________

Secondary consideration: The history of <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - the evolution of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, is one of "acceptance" where at first, things considered harsh and dissonant are gradually used more and more and are accepted.

As time goes on, chords that were previously not chords achieve what I like to call "chord status" - which we sort of indicate by giving them a "name". So, for example, the diminished chord I used above is at first simply chromatic lower neighbor motion across a half beat. But as time goes on, and people become more and more familiar with that sound, and accept it, by the time you get to Tchaikovsky is achieves a chord status similar to all other chords (which is why we give it the name "common tone diminished 7th" or ct^o7 ).

This is mainly indicated by duration - it gets held longer, and becomes a "stand-alone" chord.

We can say the same thing happened with chordal 7ths in general - but by the CPP these were well accepted.

The 9th on the other hand was still in the process of achieving chord tone status during the CPP - not really until Beethoven do 9ths - and especially borrowed b9s on a V7b9 type chord become more of a "chord tone" than a result of a 9-8 suspension for example.

One thing that's interesting is in some cases, the things that were NCT dissonances originally achieve "chord tone status" but are still dissonances and treated that way. But by the end of the Romantic period - and especially with Jazz, not only has the 7th (and ultimately 9th, 11th, and 13th) achived chord tone status but are even no longer considered dissonances.

So we could say, broadly, that dissonant notes were first accepted as NCTs with specific resolutions, then later achieve chord tone status but are still dissonant. During that time, their specific resolutions become less specific, until they can go unresolved at which point they have achieved both chord tone status and consonance status.

Kostka/Payne have an interesting approach to these chords, which they call "Sonorities" instead. "Chords" that are "resultant" of NCT motion but are still "in transition" if you will are called "Sonorities" by them and when they label them, they give them "letter" or "name" names rather than Roman Numeral Names. "Common Tone Diminished Seventh Chord" "German Augmented Sixth Chord" "V^sub6 Chord" - the latter is a V or V7 chord where the 5th is on the 6th - so a cadence might look like Em^6 to C - but it's REALLY G to C - the D is just replaced by what used to be an Escape Tone. Some of these names are historical (Neapolitan, "national" +6 chords) and others are their own inventions.

But their point is that these chords are more specifically formed from Voice-Leading and NCT motion and are either still in transition or have just recently (historically speaking) become "stand-alone" chords outside of their original Voice-Leading origins.

ALL chords evolved that way, but by the CPP - and our development of naming systems - things like 7th chords were commonplace and considered "part of the system" - and especially Diatonic and Secondary/Borrowed chords were all considered part of the system and now all stand-alone harmonies not necessarily dependent on their contrapuntal origins.

And I say all that because you are going to ultimately see V4/3 chords that do operate as "stand alone" chords. So it more so than the other versions is depending on NCT motion - is a "resultant" <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but it's maybe "further along" or, because it's so clearly related to the other inversions, we just went ahead and lumped it in.

So unlike 6/4 chords, which history maintains as "resultant" harmonies for a much longer time and really even in the CPP shouldn't really be considered "true" chords at all, the V7 becomes a much more prominent player and sort of "has to have" chord status as that's how it operates (one 6/4 construction even resolving to it!) and had been doing so long enough that the voice-leading origins were not really deemed necessary to point out.

Still, IMHO, the V4/3 should maybe be looked at a little more closely in some contexts as it may be more "resultant" than the others.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The answer is in the analysis of the pieces you've analyzed.

Which orchestral, jazz, and rock pieces have you analyzed?

Have you studied their chord progressions, and structure? How melodies are formed and relate to the <b><u>harmony</u></b>?

While we can mix genres now, is I - IV - bIII - I more likely an orchestral, jazz, or rock progression? What about I - I^6 - IV - V^6/5 /V - I ^6/4 - V7 - I? What about I^maj7 - V^7 /ii - ii^7 - bII^7 ?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You know, probably.

I think, it's a conclusion I came to over time as I studied more counterpoint and ended up teaching theory and I was trying to help students understand "where these things come from and why" because you know, a student asks a "why" question and you can't answer it, so you go figure it out!

In Stephan Kostka &amp; Dorothy Payne's "Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" text, they kind of take this approach but it's been a while since I looked at it (we use a different text now and alas I haven't taught theory courses in a while - too many homework assignments to grade!) so IIRC it was a lot of "reading between the lines".

One of the ones I think really clicked was their example of the V^subs6 chord because IIRC they sort of showed how it evolved from an Escape tone.

The way it works is this:

D - C

B - G

G - E

G - C

So there's a V - I resolution.

When you add an Escape Tone to the melody, it goes D - E before moving on to the C.

The E is a NCT.

The initial example is with the D like a dotted 8th and the E a 16th - very brief, and pretty obviously a melodic decoration and not a chord tone.

But then they give some examples (I'm pretty sure it's Haydn after all these years) where the chord is:

E - C

B - G

G - E

G - C 

(or some similar voicing).

And they point out that this is NOT an Em chord, but clearly a chord with Dominant Function - so they want to call it "V" something. But because this Escape Tone NCT is now the entire duration of the chord (and usually it still came from a D like in a ii^6 chord before) they want it to have a "chord" name/symbol. So they go with V^subs6 (or V^sub6 can't remember for sure). Basically the 6th (of the chord) substitutes for the V.

I discussed this with others years ago and people who learned from different sources approached them very different ways - some would say even in that latter context it's *still* a NCT  Others see it as worth naming as part of the chord and have other names for it, but basically align with Kostka/Payne's interpretation.

So I like the concept of these things starting as NCTs, then achieving "chord tone status" and when you start looking at music that started of linearly - counterpoint - but became more harmonically driven - Monody, Homophony, Homorhythmic Polyphony, and so on, it kind of just makes sense in the whole transition.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Why is functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> limited to Ionian and Aeolian?

It's not.

It's limited to Major and Minor.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>To answer your question more fully, "Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" in the strictest definition, is part of an overall "style" called Tonality and more specifically evolved in tandem and as part of "Key-based" music - what we'd call the "Major/minor" system where **KEYS** evolved from and replaced Modes.

Modality existed prior to Tonality and did not really use "Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" (though, as the Modes evolve toward Major and Minor scales and thus Keys, <b><u>harmony</u></b> too "becomes more and more functional" during the transitional period).

Today, we have sort of a "Modern Modality" or a hybrid mix of Tonality and Modality.

In essence, we use Major and Minor Keys, and we still treat them either functionally or "psuedo-functionally" and mix in elements from Modes as well (and even other resources such as modes of harmonic minor and so on). Of course there is also entirely non-functional music that just uses chords from Keys.

Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is sort of "about" two things:

1. Implying and ultimately confirming a Key Center through use of Key-specific pitches, harmonies, and harmonic progressions that end in "understood" cadences the confirm the key center.

2. A hierarchical set of harmonies or harmonic motion that "leads to" or "progresses to" the Tonic of the established key center.

So what you can do is take a typical functional progression:

I - ii - V - I

and cast it into a Mode. Let's say you use Mixolydian. The chords would now become:

I - ii - v - I

So the "modal v" or "minor v" isn't "functional" in the stricter definition of the word - not so much because the music is modal rather than key-based, but because the "function" of the chord is weakened by it not containing the leading tone.

We even often say it's not even "Dominant Function" even if we call it the "modal dominant" - dominant there just means scale degree. But the "Dominant Function" implies a resolution to the Tonic, with the Leading Tone contained in the Dominant Function chord.

And, because we are so conditioned to hear functional progressions as pointing to a key, we actually usually **don't want to use functional progressions** in modal music.

A great example is traditional Minor - we had to "re-orient" the listener in minor keys by changing its minor dominant chord to a Major chord with Dominant Function. Because otherwise, Minor key progressions will sound like they're "drifting" towards the relative Major key. So we have to "force" a functional progression in there to make it point to Am instead of C as the Tonic.

We actually used to do this with modes as well - and actually it's part of what made modes become Keys.

But today, if we do that, it can sound a little "too classical" which is not a sound everyone wants when composing "modally" - instead, they want a "pure mode" and again, because Major and Minor are SO ingrained in us that we want to do everything we possibly can to make sure our Dorian or Phygian piece doesn't sound like plain old Major.

And this is also why Ionian is a rarer mode - it just sounds too much like Major to even make a distinction.

By sticking to "pure" minor only, we can give a song an Aeolian feel - but we can't do the functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> because that's exactly what we did to traditional Minor to make it stand alone from Major.

So we **must avoid functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>** in Aeolian or else it's just plain old minor again.

Likewise, if we start "functionalizing" any of the modes, we end up with either chord progressions that point to other keys, or introducing accidentals that have the same result.

So if you play my chords above - say:

C - Dm - Gm - C and follow it with an F chord, you're going to go "that sounds like the logical resolution".

Because it sounds like V - vi - ii - V - I in F - functional progressions in F. Even though I used a functional progression in C to begin with, and modified it slightly to make it modal, the way modes are related mean these simple changes can produce progressions that are still functional - but not in the key we want!

So let's try this:

C - Bb - Gm7 - C

I think you will find that sounds more satisfactorily "in C" and even if you follow it with F, it's not quite as satisfying a resolution.

And that's because the C - Bb is a non-functional progression.

So without changing the Gm7 to G7 - which both takes us out of the mode and turns it into traditional Tonal functions, our better bet is just to avoid any progressions in the mode that might be construed as functional to begin with.

Of course, there are other ways that "mode centers" are established - repetition, drones, emphasis on the "tonic" chord at important musical points, melodic material, and so on.

In fact, this "tonal conditioning" is so ingrained in us, it's really really hard to use any of the "tonal trappings" and make the music sound modal - we actually have to go out of our way to do the opposite of what tonality would do so it doesn't sound "too tonal".

A great example is older Modal music like that of Palestrina. Whenever I play something like that for students in a class who know tonal music and cadences, they'll usually say "wait, what, it ended on the wrong chord???"

Well, their "tonal conditioned ears" orient their hearing to hearing a certain chord as the "Tonic" - but when the piece ends "not on the tonic" they're surprised and confused. It's because what they think is the tonic is not the "Final" - becuase it's modal music not tonal.

Now, Palestrina wrote before Tonality even existied, so they didn't go out of their way to avoid anything "too tonal" - in fact ultimately they embraced it and that's what caused modality to evolve into tonality.

But now, since we're so conditioned by tonality, it's much harder to undo the damage - we "can't unhear it"!

So when we write music modally, we usually want to avoid anything "too tonal" like the plague - and functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, being so much a part of the tonal system, it defeats the whole purpose.

_______________

We could of course "re-define" "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" to describe things that commonly happen in modal music - what is "afunctional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" or "non-functional" or "anti-functional" in Tonal music would be the exact way modal harmonies function!

So for example, we could call I - bVII - I a functional cadence in Mixolydian.

So it depends on your reference point - whether you're approaching modes through a tonal lens, or from a modal lens.

HTH



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;This question is a bit broad and vague, so you may not get amazing answers.

Agreed.

Some rock bands have a lead singer and most of the vocal harmonies are then above.

But some, with really high singers, put the harmonies below.

They sound "different" but the reasoning is really one of voice range more than anything else.

Journey had two lead singers at one point - Greg Rolie and Steve Perry. Steve Perry sang high, and the rest of the guys sang below him.

But the real question is which is the melody line - in that case Perry usually had the melody and Rolie and everyone else was below him.

But that's not always the case.

Some bands don't have but one lead singer and they overdub all the harmonies themselves, so that can sound different as well - Boston for example - Brad Delp just did all the harmonies himself - and just sang higher than his lead line (though sometimes lower, or "ooohs" and stuff that surround the melody line).

But I'd say by and large, it's the "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" goes above the melody - either a 3rd above mostly or sometimes triads above and so.

Singing lower ones is maybe a little less common but not at all rare - and it's much a difference as "low range" versus "high range" as it is about which note is the melody.

And of course usually the production is such that the melody line is made louder than the rest anyway.

I think it's mostly a question of "try it every way and see which gives you the sound you want for the song".

Then you also have to deal with vocal ranges as a practical matter.

An interesting case in pop music is Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham - Nicks's range was lower, and the male would take the lead line while the female did the <b><u>harmony</u></b> BELOW which is kind of less common. But another good one (with the genders where we're used to) is "Time After Time" by Cyndi Lauper - where she takes the top line and the male singer sings <b><u>harmony</u></b> beneath her. But again, that's more a practical range reason than anything.

And even with vocal harmonies in pop music, while they might be above most of the time, most of the instrumental <b><u>harmony</u></b> is below (which is also probably why the lower ones are less common).

Now if you're talking instrumental music things are different. It's more common to harmonize a melody by adding <b><u>harmony</u></b> below it, as in the style of a Bach Chorale.

But even historically - the very first <b><u>harmony</u></b> - there was pretty much equal distribution of above or below.

But in equal-voiced textures, we can't really tell what the melody is, especially if it's not doing anything noticeably different from the other lines.

So really it's kind of one of those things you need to just try yourself and see how each sounds in each context, and decide which one you want. You got a singer who screeches when they sing high - might want to go low!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, I'm sensing a little anger or frustration here. Step back, take a breath :-)

I think "we" both know that one can not possibly go into detail about every single possibility when someone asks a questions. Some assumptions have to be made.

If someone's asking about Modes and Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, it's a pretty safe bet that they're not really concerned with 12-Tone etc. at this point.

MOST people - and your experience may be different and your lifetime mileage may have varied - come at music from a primarily tonal or key-based paradigm, and of course most theory instruction, or instrumental instruction, kind of focuses on that. So I'm addressing those people, or attempting to.

The other statement was probably unnecessary, more of one of my digs at all those who, when you leave out something, suddenly jump out and go "but wait...!". So just trying to nip some "but waits" in the bud.

I think your statement about it's a little limiting that lots of theory here doesn't get any deeper...

I don't know that *it* is limiting, it's just that we don't really get a chance to talk about it so much.

My experience with this forum thus far is the vast majority of people here are beginners and often know very little about theory beyond the fundamentals. Borrowed chords, or modes, are new and exciting to them - and something they need to comprehend in order to move on to more advanced topics.

Years ago when I sold sheet music in a store, I used to hear the publisher's reps constantly say things like "we sell 100 level 1 books for every level 2 book we sell - people just never get much past level 2".

I'd love to talk about, and learn about some more advanced topics.

But personally I'd like to have a discussion rather than be given some links to a journal or book I can't access online.

I'm just trying to adjust the information for the audience. I'm not going to go on about "that and the other" when maybe the poster is still on "this" (though I'll probably go on abut *something* :-)


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There's no such thing as complex <b><u>harmony</u></b>, only <b><u>harmony</u></b> you haven't gotten used to yet ;-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If it's Rock/Pop, it's 2 and 4, and if it's Jazz, 9 and 11 :-)

I joke, but it's not far from the truth.

Yes, "extended chords" and "extensions" is the name for the notes "stacked in 3rds" above the 7th.

Generally speaking, we use "in thirds" (Tertian) stacking for most things:

1-3-5-7-9-11-13 - that's 7 notes, and all the notes of the scale traditionally, so there's not really a "15th" or anything higher.

G-B-D-F-A-C-E (G)

Basically it works like this:

Any 9th, 11th, or 13th chord MUST contain the 7th as well, and this does in fact partially distinguish things like 6 from 13.

A G9 chord would contain a 7th chord + the 9th - G-B-D-F-A.

G11 chord would be 7+11 and may also contain the 9 - G-B-D-F-(A)-C

G13 would be 7+13, and may also contain the 9 and/or 11 - G-B-D-F-(A)-(C)-E

If the 7th is not present, all of the above chords become "add" chords instead:

G-B-D-A would be Gadd9 (or you see G(add9) and things like that as well).

G-B-D-C would be Gadd11.

However, traditionally, G-B-D-E has been called G6, so there's no "Gadd13" necessary. Likewise though the 6th has been "added", it was so common early on that the "add" has been subtracted from the name!

Another common structure with a similar result is "6/9" which would be:

G-B-D-E-A = G6/9. It's sort of really "add 9 add 13" if you like, but based on the above it's like "G6add9" but they just went with G6/9 a long time ago. I have seen various variations of it online but in actual published music it's pretty much always written with the"6/9" kind of notation (engraved, published music).

2 and 4 have their own special little place.

They are used for "sus" or "suspended" chords.

The idea is that the 3rd of the chord is replaced by the 4th or the 2nd.

G-A-D would be Gsus2.

G-C-D would be Gsus4.

There is no "minor" version because we don't know what the 3rd is so they don't distinguish major from minor (even if we know from the key what it probably is).

It is possible to have things like 7sus4:

G-C-D-F = G7sus4

____________

2 has been used, maybe erroneously, at least in the recent past (in my lifetime) to indicate a 9th that is added in the lower octave.

C-D-G-E would be called "Cadd2" rather than Cadd9". (or just C2 a lot of times, which lead to sometimes people "correcting it to "C9" which would be wrong, becuase it would have to have the Bb).

It's a pretty inconsistent practice and IMHO probably should be done away with. But it does bring up a widely misunderstood and misapplied topic:

The numbers are absolutely NOT meant to show voicing in any way shape or form. It's meant to show "content" or "quality" if you will. So all the people who come on forums like this asking "how do I name this chord" are often trying to find a name for it that will tell a player exactly what notes to play. That's not what these are for, or were intended for, or in many people's opinions, should be used for. That never stops people from trying - so that's where we got this "2" idea when it should have been "add 9".

However, explaining a chord like C-E-F-G as "Cadd11" is almost always going to make someone voice it with the 11th on top or make them scratch their head becuase they heard somewhere 11 was an "avoid note" when the 3rd was present.

So "Cadd4" really does create a sense of what the writer was going for.

But we as a playing culture probably need to decide on some standards - are these going to meant to show voicings, or are they to be open to interpretation of the player?

The obvious case is the 5th of the chord.

It is quite common to omit the 5th of the chord in a voicing. But we don't really write that.

I used to see "power chords" for guitar written as C(no3rd) or C(omit3). Now the common symbol is C5.

But you could imagine if we had to write C(omit3add9) for Csus2!

So the system has a lot of inconsistencies but by and large they're due to historical evolution and practical needs for performance and just common acceptance.

__________

Speaking of omitting the 5th, there are names that do show note content if not voicing.

For example, a #11 and a b5 are the same note.

G-B-F-C# would be assumed to be G7#11, but it could be G7b5 - or, the symbol used for it could be G7b5.

The difference is, if you put G7#11, while the player will *probably* omit the 5th, the chord symbol actually implies that it (as well as the diatonic 9th*) could be present.

G-B-(D)-F-(A)-C# are your pool of notes for this symbol.

But if the symbol were G7b5 - then the implication would be that the D is Db, and no other "plain 5th" should be part of any <b><u>harmony</u></b> or scale used for improv (in most cases).

So you have to be careful with some of them.

*some folks follow a "7+X" formula means that ONLY that extension is to be added - 7#11, or 7b13 means that the 9th in the first one or the 9th and 11th aren't to be played in the chord - again this starts to get into more specific voicings, but many people opt for things that are either polychords or "alternate" root chords to imply 7+9+11+13 voicings.

For example, G/A implies a G chord with an A root - A-G-B-D which is "A11" - we'd assume it is Am11 if the A chord would be minor, and A11 if it were dominant. But again, the "pool" of notes could be assumed to be A-C-E-G-B-D for example, and a person seeing the symbol might freely add the 3rd and/or 5th to the chord if they desire.

A "polychord" is usually written "stacked"

G
_

A

So it's a "full" A chord on the bottom - A-C#-E and a "full" G chord on top - G-B-D - for A-C#-E-G-B-D or what is essentially "A11". But again, in practice, though the intent may seem clear in terms of voicing, players may go "well, that's just an A11" or leave off the 5th of the A chord, or the 3rd from the A chord if it's implied in the key, and so on.

But a lot of times it's a whole lot easier to read Bbm7 over C to get a C7(b9,11,b13) chord!

____

Generally speaking, if an extension is altered, we put 7+alt.ext.

so G9 is just G9. So is Gm9, and Gmaj9.

But, if the 9th is altered, it's listed as a 7th chord with the alteration:

G7b9, G7#9, Gm7b9 and so on.

If it becomes complex, or accidentals can become confusing - Db9 - is that "Db7 with a 9th" or "D7 with a flat 9"? we will put parentheses around the altered (and even plain) extensions - and some do it as a practice just to be consistent.

C7(b9) or Cmaj7(#11).

For some chords, with b or #5, we can use the "o" or "+" symbol but most people opt for the following:

Cm7b5 or C9(#5) - the latter instead of "C+9"

_____

So quick recap (or TL/DR):

2 and 4 are used as "sus" to replace the 3rd of the chord. Fsus2, Esus4. They really probably shouldn't be used to show octave/voicing for the "9th" but in the case of "Cadd2" or "C2" they have occasionally been and sometimes still are used.

6 is used as if it were "add 6" because of long standing tradition, which implies the 7th is not also present (making it a 13).

9,11, and/or 13 are used by themselves or in combination to imply a 7th chord plus that extension, and in most cases (but a lot of people don't follow this), every other possible extension below the highest number.

If the 7th is not present, any 9 and /or 11 become "add", however, "add 11" is specifically taken to mean that ONLY the 11 is added, not both the 9th and 11th, unlike what 11 often implies with 7th chords (that the 9th may also be added).

HTH

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In chords, no.

However, it's absolutely common to describe the INTERVAL of an 8ve+3rd as a "10th" and one of 8ve+5th as a "12th".

The others are 9th, 11th, and 13th as you'd expect.

There's no "15th" as it's called "double octave" instead.

So you might see someone say "the melody was harmonized in parallel 10ths".

10th is by far the most common one used as it's just an octave expansion (called a "compound interval") of parallel 3rds or just 3rds in general, which is the "default" <b><u>harmony</u></b>-building interval. 12th is not uncommon as it describes the octave expansion of a 5th - so we don't want parallel 12ths any more than we want parallel 5ths in some styles of music!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>First of all, is it REALLY a cadence?

There are a lot of people here who don't know what cadence means, and just think it's a synonym for "progression".

Secondly, are you SURE the chords are correct - is it possibly ii - I7 in C, or even more likely, vi - V7 in F?

Thirdly, this is not a "tonal" cadence. Since it's been a while, there are but 4 types of cadences, and they are rather specific:

Authentic - V-I, or loosely, dominant *function* to tonic.

Deceptive - V to VI (or IV^6, etc.), or loosely, dominant to non-tonic.

Plagal - IV to I, or loosely, pre-dominant to tonic.

Half - ? - V, or loosely, non-dominant to dominant.

Half may also be seen (or has been interpreted to include) as any cadence that ends on a non-tonic chord (excepting Deceptive Cadences) where there is a weaker sense of finality, and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> demands continuation, or is "open" (meaning the music will go on) etc.

But i - bVII7 would be extremely rare in "tonal" music of the Common Practice Period, which is where these names are applied.

It's not a "standard cadence".

At best, if it truly is a cadence, it would have to be a Half Cadence using the extended interpretation of Half Cadence, or working under the assumption that the VII7 is a "dominant substitute" of some sort.

But whenever you see something that's not a "standard" cadence, your first course of action should be to double- and triple-check that it is in fact a cadence, and your second course of action should be to determine if this is really CPP music and if applying terminology from that genre is informative for whatever genre it is if not CPP.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yeah then I'd agree with the others - your "Jazz" arps of basically 7th chord arps.

9th chords are funny because you end up with a scalar segment if you play 7 - 8 - 9 in a row so some people look at a 9th arp as just a 7th arp a 3rd up - so that's important to be able to know.

For example, if you want an Am9 arp, you just play a Cmaj7 arp - so you get all the notes of the Am9 except the A - which is carried by the bass and/or the <b><u>harmony</u></b> typically, and less necessary for the arp unless you really want the scalar segment in there.

And that again shows why the 7th chord arps are so important.

See what GonkieMcFadden said again - same principle.

Some arps are "multi-purpose" when you add 6th chords.

For example, a Cm6 arp - C-Eb-G-A is actually the same as Am7b5. C6 and Am7 are the same.

So:

m7 = 6

m7b5 = m6

so I agree taking these from both perspectives.

Then when you want an arp for F9, you can be thinking Cm6 or Am7b5 to "stack" above the F note.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>TMK, there isn't any standardization.

IOW, I wouldn't start saying "the 16th" or even "chordal 16th" unless it was in a context where it was clear you were talking about Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and not Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b> (and not quartal **voicings** of Tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>*).

Obviously, even if you say "the 4th" when referring to a chord member, if a person doesn't know you mean Quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b> they're going to assume you mean like a sus4.

*be careful with the words "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>". Most people (jazz players...) use the words to mean quartal **voicings** which are simply 4th based voicings of tertian harmonies - it's not a new harmonic system. C7sus4 voiced in 4ths is not "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" or even a "quartal chord" - it's a tertian-based chord with a displaced tone. Obviously, when you get to 13th chords you can stack them all in 3rds, or 4ths, or 5ths, or 6ths, or 7ths, or 2nds - which is funny because people are so "scale oriented" you'd think they'd come up with "secundal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" first but the tendency is to voice chords open so there you go. G-C-F-Bb, the Bb is still the "7th" of the chord. But you could absolutely call the INTERVAL between G and Bb a 10th. If it were voiced: F - C - G - Bb and was still a C7sus4 (because of context) then the F to Bb could absolutely be called the interval of the 11th. But the Bb is still the "7th" of the chord.

Some people do not care to make this distinction however, so YMMV on this one.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Absolutely OK.

However, you should know that the "Blues Scale" is already "off scale" if you're using one of the primary blue notes, b5 (Eb or D# in the key of A).

Also, usually "blues" create additional blue notes by using b7 and b3 (G and C in the key of A) over what is otherwise an A MAJOR SCALE.

This means you're already "off scale" (out of the key, or using chromatic notes) just by using the Blues Scale (at least, one particular type).

Most people do not use a "blues scale" or "Pentatonic Scale" to make music. They use it for a MELODY, but the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is often still just a Major or Minor Scale - or better yet, KEY.

So in the KEY of A Major, the diatonic (in key) notes are:

A B C# D E F# G# A

If you use an A Major Pentatonic Scale for a melody, a riff, a bass line, or whatever, you're really using a SUBSET of those notes:

 A B C# D E

But usually the <b><u>harmony</u></b> still uses the other notes of the key as well (there are examples of strictly pentatonic music but most contemporary popular music is not like that).

If you use a C, G, or Eb/D# - those are "blue notes".

One way many people get them is to use "the blues scale" by which many people mean a Minor Pentatonic Scale (with the possible addition of the b5).

A - C - D - (Eb) - E - G - is the Minor Pentatonic Blues Scale.

It is actually a SUBSET of the MINOR SCALE (not counting the Eb) but by using it in A MAJOR, you end up with those b3, b7 (and b5) blue notes.

And FWIW, while it's not uncommon for a piece of music that's not blues to be 100% Diatonic, it's actually kind of rare comparatively speaking - most pieces have some kind of chromatic notes, or change keys, or something. And pretty much any blues-based guitar solos (or keyboard, or flute, etc.) use these blue notes so we could say in pop music it's actually pretty rare to use notes in one and only one Key.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>1. As I said, the UC/LC RN is a great way for others looking at your work to understand you more clearly. It's also fairly widespread online, so it's good idea to get used to it so you can communicate with others - it's usually clear which system they're using.

2. In CPP music - which is essentially what you're working on here, there is no such thing as "Harmonic Minor". There is the "Minor KEY". And in any Minor Key, the 6th and 7th scale degrees are adjustable. When we adjust scale degree 7, we do it for "harmonic" reasons - to make v into V and bVII into vii^o . So that's where this idea of "Harmonic Minor" comes from as a "scale". But it's not. You raise scale degree 7 for HARMONIC reasons. More specifically to turn v and bVII into FUNCTIONAL DOMINANT chords. "III" doesn't have a Dominant function even in it's altered state (and worse, neither does imM7!) so it's actually completely uncommon to use III+ in minor. All the textbooks that show that chord really do it as an excuse to show an example of the one common chord type we're always taught about - augmented - for which no actual examples exist in diatonic keys. So basically, NEVER use III+ in any kind of CPP-based writing. If it's Jazz, OK, but even there it has specific uses.

3. Yes, stick to primary chords. And yes, the descending 5ths sequence is a great time to use the other chords for variety. This chart is what you need: http://globalguitarnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Chord-Motion_Major-Key.png  and http://globalguitarnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Chord-Motion_Minor-Key.png . Basically, the further to the left you are on the chart, the rarer the chord. So you can see III in both Major and Minor keys is pretty far out there. Stick to the ones closer to the  I chord - IV, ii, V, and vii^o, as well as vi as it often moves to and from V (many charts show that arrow going both ways).

4. There are thousands if not millions of pieces that have only I and V in them, and another huge amount that may be mostly that with just a ii or IV near the cadence! It is less common in a chorale style but yes you're right - you probably "should" do this! When you learn more chords, most likely it would just be the V^6/4 that gets replaced by a V7 or vii^o chord. But it would still be Tonic-Dominant-Tonic-Dominant and so on. Now of course if you turn in a paper to a teacher and you're supposed to be adding more other chords in and you only turned in I and V, you'd probably get poor marks, but in real music (which is our ultimate goal, right?) they are the cornerstones of tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Yin and Yang if you like.

5. Here's another little tidbit - while you're not to this point yet, what you kind of ultimately find out is that a piece of music is far more likely to use a chord from outside of the key than it is to use a iii chord in Major for example! The piece will more likely modulate to a new key or tonicise a new key before it ever uses a iii in Major! So it's kind of funny how we learn to use "chords in the key" first - which makes them seem like they're the most important, but in reality, some of the in key chords aren't really all that important in the grand scheme of things!

I wanted to do this for you - looking at Mozart's Piano Sonata in C Major, K545, 2nd movement. It's in G. It goes:

I - V4/3 - I - IV6/4 - (ct^o7) I - V4/3 - I - vi - I6 - ii6 (IV) - IV6 - I6/4 - V (V7) and that's the first phrase to the half cadence.

There are 10 beats with a G chord (not counting the I6/4)

5 with a D chord (one more if you count the I6/4 as part of it and one more if you count the final notes of the phrase which are part of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> but unaccompanied).

4 beats with a IV chord (2 of which are 6/4, so "weak function" an embellishment of I)

1 ct^o7 - which is just an embellishment of I again, so both it and the IV chords are more "elaborations of I" than independent chords - at least functionally speaking.

1 vi chord.

1 ii^6 chord.

So you see how it's weighted - 50% Tonic, 25 percent Dominant, 24 percent Pre-Dominant (including the ii^6) and 1% "other".

I might not have the percentages exactly correct, but you get my point.

If you look at Rondo alla Turca, which is K300  in Am it goes:

i - V - i - V - i - sequence moving to bVII, then VI - ii^6 - I6/4 - V7 - i then repeats the phrase and modulates on.

4 i chords

3 V chords.

1 each bVII, VI, and ii.

Now we could certainly find counter examples - I know a Mozart THeme and Variations that goes a very pop-song like - I - VI - II - V kind of progression - so a more even distribution. And again, with Chorales, there's a little more variety. But I is like the Queen in Chess, V like the King, ii and vii like the bishops, and IV like the knights. The rooks are more vi. Then iii is more like a pawn in that they're disposable :-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;What I'd like to know is what your thoughts are when it comes to counterpoint and guitar.

it's rather difficult, becuase the guitar evolved primarily as a chordal instrument. But it can be done, and there are many great contrapuntal pieces - but they are Classical (or what most people call Classical music) like the Bach Bouree in Em.

&gt;Jens Larsen specifically mentions that he studied counterpoint for a year in school and he didn't find it particularly helpful.

Jens posts here, so you should ask him directly. He seems a helpful guy so would probably be willing to expand on it.

Without seeing his comment, I would say that from what I know of Jens, he's primarily into Jazz and Jazz by it's nature is not really a "contrapuntal form" so naturally studying it is not going to be as useful. That of course is not to say that counterpoint can't be introduced to Jazz, but it's just that it's not sort of the main thing that most people do when they play Jazz (or any non-contrapuntal music for that matter).

&gt;As someone that plays guitar, do you advise studying counterpoint?

No.

With the following exception: anything you learn can be of use, so it could be helpful. But it's kind of like asking if you want to be a baker, do you really need to learn how to mill your own flour?

If you're interested in counterpoint, sure, study it.

But most people are under the mistaken impression that Counterpoint is some "solution" - some magic bullet that's going to make them better composers.

It's not when it's not applicable to what you're doing.

&gt;Would I be better off just focusing on functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>?

If you are not learning songs - the music of others, then THAT is what you need to be concentrating on.

You do not need theory, counterpoint, functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or any of that crap. You need to learn real songs by real musicians. Thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands. As many as you can possibly learn - even ones that don't interest you.

You can learn Theory, or functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> (part of theory), or Modes, or Counterpoint, or whatever to help you describe and maybe understand some of the things going on and appreciate them to a greater degree, but let's say, if you can't get through your basic 4 chord song, you need to be focusing on that.

&gt;There's so much to learn when it comes to functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> but if I'm understanding counterpoint correctly it seems like a part of the puzzle that is functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 

Actually, there's very little to learn.

Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> evolved from Counterpoint. Done.

Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is "about" establishing a Tonal Center and then creating sounds that "progress towards" that Tonal Center.

The former is done through the use of chords (and melodic tones) particular or unique to a Key and the latter is done with specific chord progressions and "understood" cadential figures.

That's about it.

(side note, what most people think is "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" isn't really, but that's a different series of posts).

Essentially, the movement from Pre-Dominant, to Dominant, to Tonic is what "tonality" is all about.

&gt;Teaching myself jazz guitar is not easy 

Which is why you need concentrated study with a teacher to be really successful. But, learning the music on your own can certainly help. But you need to learn to play all the standards from the "great American songbook" or the Real Books before you worry about all this other stuff.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>D-D-A-A-B-G-A

F-F-E-C-D--D--

Play it.

Now play the chords (or bass notes) with it:

Dm---Dm---G---Dm

F---C---Dm---Dm---

The "sound of Dorian" is that B natural note, and to some degree the G <b><u>Harmony</u></b> that goes with it (instead of the usual Gm from the key of Dm).

You have to "orient" your ear to D (D minor mode) but make use of the B note in ways that "sound modal" and not "Major/minor".

Listen to the Verse of "Eleanor Rigby" by The Beatles.

Listen to "Oye Como Va" by Santana.

Listen to "Greensleeves" - some versions are modal and use the raised 6, while others are "tonalized" and use the b6 - see if you can find two versions that are different in soak it in. I always through the "modal" version sounded odd - but that's because I heard the other one first and more frequently.

So it can sound odd if you come at it through a "tonal lens". 

But listening more to the stuff like Beatles or Santana, and playing patterns like I gave above and trying to locate them in other music and to make up your own patterns based on that will help to "get Dorian in your ear" and make it easier.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Good questions.

Most answers are vague becuase it's one of those things where "interpretation" comes into play and hard to define objectively. If we looked up the word "Modal" we'd get definitions from Psychology, and even in music specifically, it may be "of or pertaining to the use of modes in music" - but that's just very broad - not inaccurate, but broad.

I even often say Tonality "with a capital T" to mean the "style" rather than the broader definitions/interpretations of the term.

I don't consider "Modality" (with a capital M) to be "Tonality" (with a cap..oh you get it). They are two different styles and historians/theoreticians have seemed content with differentiating the two.

I don't consider Jazz, or contemporary popular music, or contemporary concert music to be "Tonality" either.

There are certainly some pieces of music written "after the Tonal era" that are 100% or largely Tonal still.

But the vast majority of it really operates on a different set of parameters.

Here's the problem though - I think most people can easily see that "Atonality" (which refers not to the broad definition but the specific style associated with Schoenberg and the 2nd Viennese school) is different enough from Tonality that it needs a different name (S and co. preferred "Pantonality" which is actually more accurate).

But - and this is the way I often put it: People aren't able to see a distinction between the way CPP music is made and the way Pop music is made.

So I say, "just because a style uses notes, and chords, and progressions, doesn't mean it's Tonal".

Because, Modality did that stuff and it's not Tonal!

But many people entering discussions like these often don't even know that Modality existed and in many cases they just thing there has never been anything but Tonality so all music must be "tonal" - at leas it we can go "play a Blues in Bb".

There is a term called "Centricity" or "Centric Music" which I prefer.

Centric music is that which uses some means to create/promote an "aural center"; a note, a <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or, if we'd like to interpret it thusly, other "known" aspects in combination (such as Bi-Tonality) and some may even extend the definition to include non-pitched elements.

Modality and Tonality are then, both forms of Centric music. A "Modal Center" or "Tonal Center" is created by various means - different means hence the difference in terms, but some "important sound" is promoted as being "the important sound".

A "Blues in Bb" in most typical situations clearly is not "in a traditional Key" (or mode). Is it "Tonality" as the style? No, I don't think so. Is it even "tonal" - well, not really - but it is what people mean by using the word "tonal" in that way - it "establishes a "notal" or "chordal" *center* and is thus a form of Centrality.

So I think we need a new name for these forms of Central music that promote that center in ways different that traditional Tonality or Modality - even if they use some aspects of those, and other established styles.

It's more of a "Tonal Modal Complex" or "Quasi-Tonal, Psuedo-Modal Fusion Complex" or something. And Blues probably deserves its own term as it really is a fusion of some non-western elements in a way that some other styles may not have included (at least, directly).

And "Post-Tonal" or "Neo-Tonal" doesn't cut it for me.

But if you ask someone if some pop song is "Tonal", they're going to go "well, all the chords come from G Major, so yes". If it's A Dorian, most of them are going to go "well, all the chords come from G major, so , yes". Or "well, it's "in A", so yes". Or "I use a G Major Scale over the VII chord, so yes".

So the terms are kind of loaded...




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, be a little careful here.

There's a lot of excitement in the jazz community about "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" which isn't *really* quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b> but quartal **voicings** of tertian chords.

If you're into jazz, and want to pursue that, great. If you google quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, that's 90% of what you're going to get.

Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> "proper" if you like is largely associated with "art music" of the 20th century to present, though since that has influenced other genres, you can find examples of "true" Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in Jazz and Art Rock.

But here's a more typical example of Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NToqopizvp0

Note that a lot of composers don't necessarily use Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> exclusively so there can be this intermixing of Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in Tertial Voicings, and Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b> with Quartal Voicings, within the same piece. And some even have purely Tertain sections contrasted with purely Quartal sections, in much the same way they might contrast a Pentatonic section against a Whole Tone section (Debussy's "Voiles").

Here's another good introduction if you're really at the very beginning, though there are also things worth reinforcing, which he states at the end of the video - "theorists are more interested in things that create new sounds, rather than different voicings" which is the reason I began by highlighting that distinction:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHQ6E3YIQS0

This page has a lot of examples; some excerpts you can listen to as well.

Remember though that not all of these pieces may be Quartal all the way through and in some cases, it's still really more voicings of tertian harmonies in 4ths that "purely" quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>. So if you go to listen to any of the "classical" examples, you might have to find a section or a movement where quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b> is utilized, rather than it just starting off that way!

Cheers
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The F# is most likely acting like a Chromatic Passing Tone.

Pop music doesn't follow the same "rules" as CPP music. The concepts of Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> do not always apply (they don't always apply in CPP music either, but it's FAR more common to ignore them in pop music).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Right, so that one is ii on the downbeat, and then when the Alto moves from G to A, it becomes a vii^o6 .

Usually in an analysis like this, it's showing a harmonic rhythm of one <b><u>harmony</u></b> per beat, so this is not showing "two chords per beat" - one on the first 8th note half of the beat and one on the second 8th note half of the beat, but rather a "dual interpretation" of what the chord could be.

Generally speaking, in this style, a root position triad like a ii chord would have two roots, a third, and a fifth.

Here it has a doubled 3rd. That's not impossible, but kind of unusual. Usually a doubled 3rd is because the chord is approached from something like a 7th chord a step below it.

Usually fro a vi^7 to a ii, the voice-leading would be for that D in the Tenor to go down to C rather than up to Eb as it does.

But if the chord were a vii^o6 - well, vii^o is supposed to appear in first inversion - which this does. The leading tone (A) should not be doubled and instead one of the other notes must be (which it does) and it typically resolves to I (which it does).

So let's say there are more thing in favor of it being a vii^o6 than a ii.

However, the way the NCTS move in the Alto part are more typical of the A being a PT rather than the G being an accented NT - but both are certainly plausible.

It could be ii with the A PT and an unusual doubling (justified by its moving to a chord a step below which is the reverse of the motion I mentioned above).

Or it could be a vii^o6 with the G being a lower neighbor.

It could be ii - vii^o6 with two harmonies on that one chord.

Any of those analyses are reasonable though my gut is to the vii^o6.

And here's why:

Look at the 2nd chord in the 3rd measure.

It's the same thing with the G and A reversed in the Alto isn't it?

And you see they didn't even indicate that it "might be" a ii chord on the 2nd half of the beat?

Why - look at the outer voices - you'll see that they move in parallel 10ths.

This is a very common pattern and the "typical" harmonies for that are I - vii^o6 - I^6 (which is why the I^6 ? makes sense here).

Looking back at measure 2 you can see that same pattern descending - Parallel 10ths in the outer voices (though the pattern begins with vi^7 instead of I6 - but look how close a vi^7 <b><u>harmony</u></b> is to a I - only one note different - here's it's the bass so it's pretty clearly a vi^7 chord, but the point is, the justification for the vii^o6 here, and the questionable I^6 later is that this whole I - vii^o6 - I^6 and I^6 - vii^o6 - I pattern with these parallel 10ths in the outer voices is crazy common.

So these alternate analyses (and even the "?" one) are likely showing that these could be another correct interpretation of what's going on here.

One of things about <b><u>harmony</u></b> like this is, when we learn it, we generally learn it to be very literal - the chord is what the sounding notes are. But as you learn more about NCTs and the style in general, you start to see familiar patterns that make other possible interpretations valid and even likely.

The "correct" one can be based on what you're trying to show - for example, if you consider the iii chords here, you have a two iii - vi - ii - V - I progressions in short span - circle of 5ths progressions - at least ones that seem to stem from that. However, if you are trying to show more about voice-leading and harmonic implication, those alternate choices are worth pointing out - and that could be what's going on in this analysis - would need more context to make any other comments.

HTH
Cheers.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ok. This is a common problem.

Music (that is, most music most people want to play, or at least learn to play in the beginning) is "Key-based".

It's not "chord based" or "scale based". 

Music is in a Key.

In the Key of G, you have 7 primary notes - G A B C D E F# (G).

EVERYTHING comes from that.

It's really that simple.

All your harmonies (chords) and all your melodies come from the notes of the Key.

When you create chords in a Key (or, if you must, from a scale) you use every other note. That would be:

G-B-D

A-C-E

B-D-F#

C-E-G

and so on.

These give you the Diatonic Triads (Triad = 3 note chords, and Diatonic means, in this context, "belonging to the Key (scale)" ).

You can also may "7th Chords" by adding one more "every other note - so 1-3-5-7, 2-4-6-1, 3-5-7-2, etc.:

G-B-D-F#

A-C-E-G

B-D-F#-A

etc.

These are "Diatonic 7th Chords".

And this process continues for all the possible diatonic chords.


______

MELODIES are also created from the Key.

NOT ALL MELODY NOTES HAVE TO BE PART OF THE CHORD.

For example, if you strum a G chord for 4 beats, then a D chord for 4 beats, back and forth we can assume you're in the key of G Major here (and since that's what we're talking about, let's assume that).

The Melody could go - in quarter notes (one note per beat): G A B C over the G chord, then D C B A over the D chord.

So over the G chord, only the G and B notes are part of the Chord.

While we could order "every other letter" to get A and C included in the chord, we don't really think of the chords this way; instead, the chords are sort of 1 stream, and the melody another stream - they do interact but there's still a bit of separation.

The D chord would have D and A part of it, and the C and B would not be chord tones.

But this is OK in both cases - we do this all the time and are used to it. All 4 notes of a melody in a measure (again assuming just 1 per beat here) could be chord tones, or only 1 of them could be. Usually 1 or more are, and none would be unusual, so we could say in general, there are typically maybe an average of at least 50% per measure begin notes from the chord.

This works because all of the stuff - the notes for the melody, and the notes for the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (or the harmonies themselves) all come from the Key.
___


Now, we could take this to mean that you can just randomly pick notes from the Key of G major to play over a chord progression of random chords from the Key of G major - you *could* but it may not sound like much of what you typically hear. That's because most people use patterns that have evolved over time to be "preferred" and that seem to have "direction" to them rather than just being "random" (but if you want that effect, you can get that too).

So most people just don't run up and down the scale while playing melodies or improvising (or, those that do, usually don't seem to be very good, or tasteful, or "melodic" in their approach). Again, you *can* but people may also want to be able to play melodically as well.

And to do that, there's no substitute for learning to play songs by other people.

______

Also, it's worth mentioning that a LOT of music does not use ONLY the notes from the Key. Some music uses only the notes from the Key, and some music uses MOSTLY the notes from the Key. As long as you have mostly notes from the key, it will still sound like the key. It's when you start adding in too many notes from other keys that it may disrupt the feeling of what the key is.

So if you're in G Major, but using A, E, and B7 chords, it's not going to sound very much like G Major because each of these chords have notes that aren't in the key of G. And if you're using ONLY those chords it's definitely going to sound like some other key.

The same with melodic notes: if you use too many from outside the key, or use only notes from outside the key, it will either sound "wrong" or even promote some other key as the main key.

We can do this intentionally if we want - it's called "modulation", but again, there are certain ways that's evolved so those moves seem intentional rather than random or "unschooled".

____

In a lot of modern popular music, Modes are common. There's a lot of confusion about these online but the easiest way to understand them is the way they are actually used in music - they are treated like - wait for it - Keys!

Or "Keys with a wrong note" :-)

But that one wrong note isn't enough to mess things up. So in many ways, it's just like the Key of G Major, with one interesting chord, that we just deal with on a case-by-case basis as far as playing melodies or improvising over.

_____

One huge exception to all this is music that has any kind of "bluesy" feel - it can still be "in a key" (or a mode) but have notes that seem like from a theory standpoint they shouldn't be there.

They are "blue notes" though and what gives blues its particular sound. And again, these have evolved into common patterns that you learn by playing the music. And when you use them right, they "make sense" and "sound right" and aren't just "random".

But what this means is, you can't make something sound "bluesy" by just running a scale up and down over a chord progression. It might work in some cases, but it can sound very amateurish and there's more to it than that.

So it's still really about "The Key" - everything comes from that, with these other "color tones" or "spices" thrown in to mix things up a bit and provide some variety and interest and maybe freshness.

______

Finally, there is plenty of music that is NOT in a key, or moves from key to key so rapidly that saying it's in any one key is impractical. In those cases you have to use other approaches.

But, for beginning, working on music in a key and understanding from the standpoint of everything coming from the key (except certain "spices") is a really good way to grasp it.

This answers that common question: "I have a progression in G Major, what scale do I use to play over it?"

Answer: G Major.

It's that simple.

"I've got some chords in G Major, how do I write a melody". Use G Major.

"I've got some chords in G Major, what do I use for a Bass line?" G Major.

"I've got a melody in G Major, how do I come up with chords for it?". Use G Major.

Once you get that down, then you can start spicing it up with other things.

Learn songs by other people, and see how they spice things up.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is really a huge question.

I would suggest looking at some pieces that were originally orchestral music that have been reduced to be playable on piano, or other piano arrangements/transcriptions of pieces originally for other instruments.

Most "Piano/Vocal/Guitar" arrangements for example have the vocal melody played as the highest note of the RH piano part.

The important part is, when you arrange something like this, it needs to retain its identity - how you do that depends on a lot of factors, but keeping the melody is the primary one, then keeping the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is also important (unless you intend to re-harmonize the piece). Probably after that for most music, the bass motion is important.

The only exception would be any important parts that are big parts of the song's identity, such as a "riff" that really makes the song identifiable.

Identify the melody first, then figure out the chords, and make sure those to things happen.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is what most theory/<b><u>harmony</u></b> textbooks are all about. Especially those that deal with the Common Practice Period (which is what this Bach piece is a part of).
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Block chords like the LH piano part are - how shall I put this - they reek of bad piano composing ;-)

Now, that's OK - you're here to learn, right?

Let's say things like that are tough - if you were Arvo Part and you wrote this, people would be handing you Grammys. But when you're a nobody, it's like "that reeks of 'I don't know how to compose for piano' ".

But, as a general rule, I'd say avoid them outside of very particular effects where it's clear the effect is intended and the listener will get that.

Otherwise it sounds muddy - and especially the low G chord - it doesn't help that even the melody is low above that.

What you should often ask yourself is, "do I need this whole triad here like this" - IOW, what if it was just C only. The melody has the Eb and quickly gets to the G. I think a lot of people are afraid that listeners won't "get" the <b><u>harmony</u></b> unless the whole <b><u>harmony</u></b> is present, but most listeners have heard this kind of thing so often that if they hear the C bass note, then the Eb, they're going to go, "oh, C Minor" and when the bass moves to the Bb they're going to recognize that kind of pattern - and once it moves to the Ab and the G it's VERY familiar to them.

IOW with a pattern that is SO familiar (Andalusian Cadence) you don't have to give your listeners "information overload" - it can actually stay pretty skeletal and they'll hear what they need.

Your opening piano melody - I'm just personally not a fan of repeated notes in situations like this. You don't really hear it in real music that much. There's nothing wrong with it, but usually it's something that's reserved for a variation of an idea, not the idea itself. It could help if it were articulated in a more typical way.

_____

One of the things I'm big on with composition is "logic" and "continuity".

Very often, music is full of repetition and elaborated or embellished repetition of ideas. This gives it continuity as a whole and "gives a reason for being" for musical ideas.

You have this repeated note thing in the opening, but when your flute comes in, it doesn't something totally different. Now, that would be OK if the piano part sort of "set the setting" - which it does - but then when the flute comes in, that "setting" goes away.

I'm not saying you have to write like "most" people of course, but more typically, the flute might play the same thing the piano just did. Or, it might at least pick up on that repeated note idea. Instead, other than it being 16th notes, it's totally unrelated.

Why do you have that Db in the Flute over the Bb Major chord. It just sounds like a wrong note. It WILL sound like a wrong note to listeners.

The next section just kind of wanders aimlessly. WHY are those notes there? Why did you change to 6/4? Why does it continue the 16th motion (which is logical and creates continuity) but then suddenly changes to 8th notes - which essentially go nowhere and basically just seem like "filler" (illogical and not any form of continuity) - only to go back to the 16th idea.

It kind of "makes no sense" if you understand what I'm saying.

Once you get to this point, what it sounds like is "I composed 4 bars, then I added 4 bars, then I added 4 bars, then I added 4 bars" - and each 4 bars has nothing to do with the previous 4 bars.

Have you ever written a long paper, or read one, where the tone changes halfway through and you can kind of tell the author wrote it on a different day, or in a different mindset?

That's what this can kind of sound like. Either that, or that it was just a bunch of disparate ideas "glued together" - that's a common way some people work but it's often not successful - it sounds like "patchwork".

____

Your 3/4 section is nice, but it's 6/8.

Why in bar 16 is the breath mark where it is?

Logically, either the 4 16ths are a pickup to the next phrase, and should be "continuous" - that is, scale wise or an arpeggio, rather than two stepwise notes with a huge leap and then another pair of stepwise notes.

This makes it sound like the D-Eb pair actually belongs to the previous D and Eb and the breath should come before the last 2 16ths instead - where the leap is - which is logical.

______

So see, these are the kinds of questions you need to be asking yourself - "is this really the best place for..." "how is this going to sound to my listeners" and so on. "Does the low Eb chord that sounds like absolute mud give me the sound I really want, or is there a better solution".

___ 

You do have some ideas return, which is good - continuity, logical, yay :-). But why do you have the flute playing a Bb over the G Major chord? Again that's going to sound like the flute player made a mistake.

_____

I guess what I'm getting at here is you've got a lot of great ideas. But - and this is actually a hard thing to do  - it would probably benefit you to try to take a single idea and try to develop it - otherwise it seems like you made a dinner and just kept throwing in all the spices you like, whether celery seed really belongs in Banana Pudding or not!

What I'd recommend is trying an idea like what you have here - the basic Andalusian cadence, and  writing a more specific "Divisions" style piece - it's like Theme and Variations over an Ostinato Bass, like:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT3pWq-ABeo

Usually the "divisions" principle will be that the melody starts in longer note values, and each variation uses quicker running values - starts in quarters, moves to 8ths, then to 16ths an so on. Kind of gets more rhythmically complex as it goes.

You're kind of already half way there and it even seems like you might have been patterning your piece after some things like this - the meter shifts kind of are similar to this other one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7yg0zZkpVQ

That one goes by quick :-) But maybe check some of these out and try to use them as models. 

I know you probably want the Piano more involved and the sort of "trade off" idea you have is right on - but maybe try to limit yourself to fewer ideas or developing one primary idea throughout or at least make it more obviously sectional like these. Then you can start messing with the form more.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>You've got an 11 minute piece here. It's well past time to ask for feedback on a low-travelled internet forum and get feedback from actual musicians and get a reading, if not a performance.

Or, you might at least post it on Flute, Oboe, and piano forums to get specific feedback on those instruments (and you might meet someone who can record it for you).

A couple of things I noticed:

A "Trio Sonata" traditionally is not a Sonata for 3 players. It's for FOUR players - two solo instruments, a bass instrument, and then continuo (which the bass is part of - basso continuo) - usually a chordal instrument (lute, harpsichord) that improvises the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and traditionally reads figured bass.

It was a Baroque form that fell out of favor in the Classical era.

You might be better of to have a title like "Sonata for Flute, Oboe, and Piano" in the manner of Debussy's "Sonata for Flute, Viola, and Harp".

Your first movement really sounds like a faster 4/4 to me. IOW, all your note values should be one up - quarters instead of 8ths, 8ths instead of 16ths, etc. But it's not a huge deal.

But yeah, what are people going to say - "wow, this sucks, needs a total re-write"?!?!?! Once you put this much work into a piece, while you may get some helpful comments on things here and there, you need to get it out there to be played on live instruments so you can get direct feedback and hear it played live.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Learn some music that has <b><u>harmony</u></b> in it. It will teach you way more than a book. Music is, "a sound is worth a thousand words" in many ways.

There are tons of resources online. 

The already mentioned Piston is good and fairly readable.

There are also a number of other university level textbooks (but pricey) that are used in Theory/<b><u>Harmony</u></b> classes to teach Theory/<b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

Kostka/Payne's "Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>".

Aldwell/Schachter's "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>"

But you might want something more accessible and cheaper, and for that, there are actually some theory books in the "Idiot's Guide" and "for Dummies" series that are quite good - you can't really "dumb down" music theory but so much and those books pretty much take the same approach as the college texts without the price tag!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ok, let's clear up a few things first.

The "rules" of anything are based on the STYLE - observations of what typically happens.

The "rules" of "standard" theory DON'T EVEN APPLY to **MOST** Western music!

Yes, the notes used in tonal music generally come "from the scale" as do the harmonies, but even in this "standard" <b><u>harmony</u></b> there are notes used that are outside of the scale, and chords that don't come from the primary key and so on. And in the key of G Major, you're going to hear tons of D and C notes being played together.

IOW, there's a LOT more to music than you're thinking about, and even what you are mentioning isn't really accurate.

The "standard rules" of <b><u>harmony</u></b> went out the window in the 20th century. Sure, some music still uses them - or expanded versions of them - but a lot of music does not - and it's not microtonal at all.

And since microtonality as we know it (or at least as you probably are thinking of it) is something that developed on its own outside of the "standards" it doesn't follow those "rules".

It might be possible of course to apply some concepts of standard functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and concepts of consonance and dissonance in a mictrotonal context, but here's the thing:

Back to what I said at first: It's STYLE-DEPENDENT. There is no "microtonal style". IOW, people have not written microtonal music in any consistent and widespread way enough to define any stylistic aspects of how it is even to be used.

Those "rules" and "standards" come from pretty much EVERYONE writing music the exact same way for an extended period of time (ca 200 years) and our then being able to look at that music and then notice these things - ah, when this happens, they do this - and for each of those thing that happen with alarming regularity, we can develop a "rule" for it. "ah yes, every time a 7th chord is used, the 7th descends by step" - then it's a "rule".

But you can't look at all the microtonal music out there and find any such commonalities. You might find consistencies in one composer's works, or, at best, a composer and those who studied with them, but there's nothing happening with any "alarming regularity" or even "predictable regularity" we can create rules from.

In order for us to derive rules, enough people have to do the same thing enough that we can say, "when this happens, this results". And that's just not happening in any widespread way. And even if it is with a single composer, ther's no reason for them to follow the standard rules of <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It's an entirely different system and is basically totally under-utilized and it's potential is not being explored if you limited it to that.

_____


That said, unfortunately, many of the people who are all excited by microtonality *aren't* taking advantage of its full potential and are just basically writing "mi-tuned standard music". So you could say those people **are** using "standard <b><u>harmony</u></b> rules" but in many cases, if they were writing non-microtonal music the music they're writing would be pretty uninteresting. A lot of them think that playing uninteresting music microtonally increases its interest level, but I don't find that to be true.

So, if they are applying the rules of 200+ year old music using microtones, it's kind of mostly anachronistic music and strange bedfellows to boot.

I'd encourage people interested in microtonality to forget "ancient rules" and more fully explore the possibilities - otherwise, there's not really any point to using microtones at all.

(note, I'm excepting historical performances of microtonally tuned Renaissance music, or music of other cultures, etc. since we're talking "rules" of "standard Western music").
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; if you want a scale that maximizes a certain interval, you build a stack of that interval. If the perfect fifth is your favorite consonance...

And one would have to prove that those were the desirable outcomes and the scale was built for that reason. Given that scales pre-date <b><u>harmony</u></b> and consonances, it's pretty clear that using "consonance" as a generating principle was not something people were trying to do.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't dislike jazz.

There's a lot of jazz I don't like - but there's a lot of pop music and classical music I don't care for either.

I don't like the genre as much as I like classical or rock. But there's certainly jazz I enjoy listening too.

I tend to like "composerly" and "composed out" music, and not a lot of heavy improvisation or any kind of "jam" music, and I tend not to like complexity for what I see as complexity's sake nor virtuosity for virtuosity's sake (so I'm not crazy about a Paganini Caprice, or shredder metal either). It's just that a lot of Jazz tends to embrace and even encourage the whole improv and "let me show you what I can do" kind of mentality which I just don't dig. I like Dixieland, 40s Big Band Swing (Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman), some more fusiony bands like Weather Report, or Yellowjackets or Fourplay, or more "crossover" things like Hancock's Headhunters, and there are some guitar jazz things I like - Django, Benson, Burrell, and of course Davis's So What. But I don't get all wet in the knickers about Giant Steps.My Favorite Things was more my speed.

What I've alluded to in the past was not that Jazz is "atonal" but that really, most modern music needs to be - should be - called something other than "Tonal" music. To me, "Tonality" refers primarily to the music of the Common Practice Period. We don't call pre-CPP music "Tonal" just because it has a center and uses notes and chords and I don't see why we should call a lot of modern styles Tonal just because they have a center and notes and chords. "Modal" music from before the CPP is "atonal" in that regard - i.e. "not tonal". And we use a different term - Modality.

And IMHO part of that distinction - a major part - or the major part - is that centrality is achieved by a different mechanism. Modality isn't just about using modes. It's about HOW the modes are used to produce a "center" or "concept of mode". Likewise, Tonal music isn't just about Major and Minor scales or keys. It's about HOW the scales are used to produce a "Tonic" or "concept of key".

Most modern music uses yet again another mechanism to achieve a Center, and it should IMHO matter less *what* is used to do it in terms of note content (since modes/scales/keys are kind of all freely intermixed) but again **how** the Center is achieved.

Functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is often out the window. So too are Cadential Formulae and other Tonic-establishing conventions. 

These are replaced by other factors. So in that sense, they are "atonal" again - "not tonal" - in that they don't use the conventions of Tonality to create a center. They use other things (other forms of emphasis).

Jazz falls into that category.

That is of course not to say that all modern Jazz, Pop, or even Classical music isn't Tonal - some of it is - some of it is even written in homage to older modality and does a good to excellent job of doing that. So I think it's fair to call that stuff whatever it is. But a lot of it is either an extension of Tonality, or a "Modo-Tonal Hybrid" (Hybridality? - I coined the term if it catches on ;-) or something new altogether.

Maybe it's "Transient Tonality" (Tm, C, R - coined that one too :-) in that it's more often shifting and morphing from key to key or mode to mode or mode to key, etc. Like the idea of "Modal Interchange", Jazz can support things like "Chord-Scale" playing because each "chord of the moment" is taken on its own rather than in the context of the piece or passage (or key) as a whole. Again this doesn't apply to ALL Jazz of course, but it does apply to a lot. Much Jazz is more akin to modulatory development sections of classical music than the main themes which are more solidly in a single key and may modulate to another definable key. Instead, it's "all over the place". So thinking about it in terms of a single key, or even multiple keys isn't really all that informative - which is why chord-scale playing developed.

But - like we were saying above - some people just don't care to make those kind of distinctions. It's not really all that important to them in the grand scheme of things.

So while some Jazz actually is literally atonal (in the Schoenberg sense) what I most likely meant in that context was that it is not "truly Tonal (with a capital T) per se" if I can be any more non-committal :-)

Tonality - music of the CPP, achieves Tonality through a very specific set of conventions.

Some modern music may, but much of it does not, just like pre-CPP music does not. So I would argue if we're going to make the distinction between Modality and Tonality in pre-CPP and CPP music, should we not also make a distinction between Tonality and "Hyrbidality" or "Transient Tonality" or "Devolving Tonality" or "Modo-Tonal Compex" or whatever we want to call it? It's not using the same conventions to create a tonal center a lot of times (or it barely is) and I think it kind of deserves it's own concept. Which would be a good thing, not a disparaging thing IMHO.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br><b><u>Harmony</u></b> doesn't *necessarily* apply (but see below).

Most "runs" are either Scalar, or Chromatic.

And most of them are devised so you can start and end a run on the right notes.

So the <b><u>harmony</u></b> does tend to apply to the starting and ending note of a run (or sometimes those two notes would be prominent melody notes that had been heard before but are now embellished with "filler" material).

Now, <b><u>harmony</u></b> *can* apply of course, and in some cases those runs can consist of either arpeggios or other chord tones that are not necessarily scalar, or they can intentionally hit chord tones on each beat, or half beat, and so on.

For example, if you play a C scale in 16ths:

C D E F | G A B C | D etc. notice you get C and G on the beat, and E on the half beat. But the 3rd beat would begin with D unless you did something like changed a rhythm or put in a chromatic. That's why you'll often see the first note lengthened so each time it repeats you get a C on the beat.

You will also see this:

**C** E F G | A B C D | **E** G A B | C D E F | **G** C D E | F G A B | **C**

See what's happening there? The pattern starts on a high note that's part of the C chord and jumps down to a note of the chord and then continues up in a way it starts over again on the next chord tone (and of course hits other chord tones along the way frequently enough).

So the <b><u>harmony</u></b> definitely impacts the composer's choice of pattern for something like this. It's also repetitive and makes it easier to play as fingering can often be identical so you can burn through them :-)

So runs are either arpeggios, scalar runs that are "filler" or chromatic runs that are "filler" where the starting and ending notes may be the only "important" ones harmonically (or melodically) speaking, and scalar or chromatic runs intentionally designed to hit harmonically (or melodically) important notes within the pattern.

We'd have to look at specific ones to determine what they're doing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Forget "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>".

All you're doing at this stage is assigning Roman Numerals to chords.

Bb is bVI

Gm is iv

Those are simply "borrowed chords", also called "mode mixture" (modal interchange is a more jazz term and has a slightly broader meaning).

The A "on beat 2" is simply a non-chord tone.

If you want to understand Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and Analysis, don't look at pop songs.

Instead, watch this video series:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LNKDHmI77o

Popular music is often simply non-functional. Trying to force into a functional framework is uninformative. The bridge here is a great example of a passage that simply doesn't really follow any functional progression.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No.

Western Europe is not the only culture to have ever existed.

Based on the lack of <b><u>harmony</u></b> in other cultures, <b><u>harmony</u></b> is not even the "default".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Penta = 5

tonic = tones, or notes.

Pentatonic Scales are 5 note scales.

That's it.

OK, that's not it. But it is really it.

But the way we use **some** Pentatonic scales  makes most of us see some of them as "the only" Pentatonic scales or as I often say, what people refer to as *The* Pentatonic Scale!

There are two basic Pentatonic Scales in widespread use in popular music styles like Rock, Blues, Blues-Rock and similar styles.

They are Major Pentatonic, which is simply a 5 note subset of a Major scale, and Minor Pentatonic, which is simply a 5 note subset of a Minor scale.

Major Pentatonic is scale degrees 1-2-3-5-6.

In C Major, that would be C-D-E-G-A.

That means you can also say that the 4th and 7th scale degrees have been omitted.

Minor Pentatonic uses 1-b3-4-5-b7

In C Minor this would be C-Eb-F-G-Bb

Note it also eliminates two notes, in this case scale degrees 2 and 6.

It's also helpful to think of these two Pentatonics like Major and MInor - I've just given you two Parallel examples, but, just like every Major Scale has a Relative Minor Scale, each Major Pentatonic has a Relative Minor Pentatonic - with the same notes!

So again, C Major Pent:

C-D-E-G-A

A Minor Pent:

A-C-D-E-G

Notice they have the same notes (just like C and Am) but start on a different note of the pattern (just like C and Am). And in this case, they both eliminate the same notes (4 and 7 of major, or 2 and 6 of minor, which are both B and F here).

_______

As for blues, there are "blue notes".

Blue notes are basically minor key notes in an otherwise major context. b3 and b7 are two blue notes. b5 (which doesn't come from any particular scale) is also a blue note.

One strategy developed by a lot of rockers (and most guitarists) is to play a MINOR Pentatonic Scale over an other Major chord progression, especially a blues progression that uses 7th chords.

So if you play C7, F7, and G7 in a typical 12 bar blues pattern, playing C MINOR Pentatonic will give you the notes:

C - Eb - F - G - Bb - so that Eb and Bb are your two blue notes.

For this reason, some people call this "The Blues Scale" or "The Pentatonic Blues Scale" or "Minor Blues Scale" and other similar names.

Likewise, b5 is often added to this so you get:

C - Eb - F - Gb - G - Bb (so really, that's a "hexatonic scale" but hardly anyone ever refers to this that way oddly enough).

_____

If you're in C, and you play C Major Pentatonic, it's not going to sound very "bluesy". If the accompaniment is bluesy enough, you can get away with it in small doses, but that's usually why the Minor Pentatonic is used instead.

If you're in C MINOR, you can use the Minor Pentatonic as well, but the "bluesyness" is more likely going to come from also adding that b5 (again, why it's called "Minor Blues Scale" sometimes when the b5 is added).

Now, of course, you can also just use plain old C Minor Pentatonic in the key of C Minor, and C Major Pentatonic in the key of C Major - it's just like using Minor and Major scales as you normally would, missing two notes (which cause fewer clashes and that's why people like them).

But for that "bluesy" sound, it's really either Minor Pent (with or without the b5) over an otherwise Major (or Mixolydian) context, or Minor Pent often with the b5 in an otherwise Minor (or Dorian) context.

The accompaniment can of course be more bluesy itself as well.

_______

There's also something more recently commonly referred to as the "Composite Blues Scale" and it can be seen as a combination of BOTH the Major and Minor Pents at the same time.

C-D-E-G-A combined with C-Eb-F-G-Bb makes:

C-D-Eb-E-F-(Gb)-G-A-Bb 

(so this could be considered an octatonic or nonatonic scale - but there's another "The Octatonic Scale" so we also generally don't do that with these).

This is maybe an oversimplification of a more complex idea because what you **really** do with this scale is not "play all it's notes" but focus on specific notes depending on the chord.

For example, you'd typically play the Eb leading into the E on the I chord (again, assuming a major or mixolydian context for a bluesy backing) but on the IV chord you'd want to avoide the E and rely more heavily on the Eb.

So just "playing this scale over a progression" might have some bluesy elements to it, but it won't sound very much like how BB King plays or something.

______


When playing a Blues (in a Blues-Rock kind of context) a couple of strategies can be employed.

1. Play C Pentatonic Minor (+b5) over all the chords in the 12 bar progression.

2. Play C Pentatonic Minor (b5) over the I chord, but C MAJOR Pentatonic over the IV chord in the 12 bar progression.

3. Play C Pentatonic Major (b5) over the I chord, but C MINOR Pentatonic over the IV chord in the 12 bar progression.

These last two strategies in essence do what the Composite Blues Scale does, except that you're focusing on the component Pents for a particular chord. In "One Way Out" by The Allman Brothers, the first solo beings with Am Pentatonic, then on the IV chord moves to A MAJOR pentatonic (the song has kind of a Dorian vibe to it).

A fourth strategy is to "transpose" your Pents so that if in C, C Minor Pent is used over the I chord and **F** Minor Pent used over the IV chord, etc. Could be the same with Major on each, or, even a mixture. These point more to what happens with the CBS, which is also "transposeable" - when you hear the melody from "Cruella DeVille", it plays the melody using essentially the CBS on the I chord, then it just transposes up for the IV chord.

This is super common with Bass lines or other accompaniment patterns so it's a bit of an oversimplification to say people just use 1 Pentatonic, or 1 scale like the CBS.

Instead, they're kind of really mixing and matching elements of each to try to catch both chord tones and available blue notes.

Really the only way to learn that is learn to play lots of tunes!

But, the "rock approach" is just to wank Pentatonic Minor over everything :-D It works for Minor, and Dorian, and Major, and Mixolydian. Add the b5 and you've got "bluesy" no matter what.

There are SO many songs that have been recorded this way that it's completely acceptable even though some look down on it and see it as a little bit "unsophisticated". IOW, you're not going to sound like BB King by just burning Minor Pent over a progression. You might sound a little more like Clapton, Page, or Angus Young at times though (but really, those guys do some excellent mixing of major and minor on their various chords and really knew what they were doing).

Finallhy, like all music, it's not really about scales. It's about note choice. A scale just sort of gives you a set of notes to work with to choose from. But which work best for any given melody or <b><u>harmony</u></b> depends on the music itself and what kind of result you want. Again, the best way to learn that is to play tons of the music.

But it is helpful to categorize things as these scales for a learning tool, and for having "guideposts" for finding your way as you're playing.

Everyone else's comments are dead on - people who have moved on - to more complex, or more modern, etc. music and musical styles don't follow these charts.

These charts are designed to show you what commonly happens in ONE STYLE of music - music from roughly 300 years ago.

If you analyzed a ton of pop music, you would find these charts totally useless for well over 50% of the music (they are applicable to SOME pop music though).

u/The_Angel_Of_Def 's post might seem a little silly, but it's actually accurate.

It's 2019. Any chord can go to any chord. Hell, we don't even have to use chords. We don't even have to use Triads. We don't even have to use Tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

This stuff is great to give us a view into the past and how things used to be done. And it's great if you're taking a course where you have to learn that stuff. And it's great to know if you want to look at something contemporary and see if it does or doesn't follow these "rules" (which you'd have to know in order to make that comparison).

But otherwise, learning to play lots of music will give you a much more complete picture of how chord progressions work.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;music of the likes of many indie artists, what should I be focusing on?

you should be focusing on the chord progressions in that music.

Here's the thing: Composers of the past didn't really use "charts".

Instead, the charts were derived from studying the music.

What we did is look at countless pieces from the Common Practice Period and discovered that every time a V7 was used, it either went to I, or vi and that was about it.

And then we looked at what chord came before that V7 chord, and it was either IV, or some form of ii, and rarely anything else.

If we did the same thing with, let's say, modern EDM music, we'd probably find that it rarely goes ii-V-I or IV-V-I. In fact, there were a number of posts here a few months back that spoke to the prevalance of chord progressions that were just asked about yesterday - bVI - bVII - I or i.

IOW, if we were to make a "chart" for EDM, we might put bVII - bVI - I instead of ii - V - I like the "classical chart" has.

So what that says is, if you want your music to sound like EDM, don't go ii - V - I, but go bVI - bVII - I.

If you want your music to sound like Bach, don't go bVI - bVII - I - they didn't use it. Go ii - V - I instead.

It's also *extremely important* to understand that these "charts" are NOT "chord progressions" but **harmonic progression**. And more importantly in the case of any CPP charts, they are **functional** harmonic progression.

What that means is, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> might be ii, but the actual chord in the piece might be Dm7/F rather than just Dm.

These "charts" are like diagramming sentences. You need a noun (I) and a verb (V). You may have an indirect object (vi) and an adverb (IV) and things like that, and they fall in certain orders - we don't say "ball the throw" we say "throw the ball".

But think about texts today. "New phone, who dis?"

Not exactly the Queen's English is it?

But back to the point, we could say "throw the ball" or "toss the ball". The meaning could change subtly, but the grammar is the same. As long as it goes "verb article noun" it's OK (as far as my example is concerned).

As long as a chord progression goes "dominant to tonic" it's OK.

It's the Queen's English.

But we aint' speakin' the Queen's English no more. There's no thees, and thys, and thous, and not many hences or hithertos.

If we look at each style of music, we would discover that chord progressions are "different styles" - Shakespearean versus Dickensian versus Tolkeinian.

The Grammar might be similar, but if we went from Shakesperiean to World War II Movie Newsian to Modern Video Game Chat Roomian, we'd find things that are virtually different languages.

And this is something that a lot of people don't really get.

These charts are a "dialect" if you like. They might all be "English", because they use the same basic "words" (notes, keys, chords, etc. for the main part) but their "grammer" and "syntax" are different enough that they'd each require their own chart to even roughly show what typically happens in most sentences.

If you want to go out and communicate with the people saying "imma cash you ousside", you might have to learn a new dialect. Walking up to them and going "my chart says in order to communicate properly, you must put the verb here, and spell this correctly, and..." - well you're going to end up on a viral video in a bad way.

If you want to write music that sounds like indie artists you like, simply learn their songs. You'll develop your own understanding of the dialect.

The chart for the Common Practice Period music is a different dialect, and may not apply.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes, Bb.

This is a "succession of chords" rather than a "musical phrase".

It's impossible to say accurately without more information.

Key is not always determined by chords alone in music.

And not all music is in a key, or any one key, or is intentionally ambiguous and so on.

In a "looping progression" which these 4 chord sequences imply, the "home" chord is typically assumed to be the first chord of the pattern without any further information.

That would make this a C Dorian progression. The "cadence" is Gm to Cm, or v - i, which is a modified (modalized) authentic cadence.

But the musical phrases that determine cadences are driven by MELODY and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> might support that, but since these 4 chord loops typically show no rhythm either, there's nothing to indicate anything else.

It will depend on **which chord sounds like home**. And that is caused by **MUSICAL EMPHASIS**

If it's the Cm chord, it's "in C, some mode". If it's the F chord, it's "in F, some mode". etc.

We are a "major prejudiced" culture, so people will tend to hear that one first, especially if they're not familiar with or don't really understand modes, so the only one that makes sense from that standpoint is the Bb.

But unless there's some **MUSICAL EMPHASIS** that tells us the Bb is the "home" chord, it may not be accurate. The only emphasis Bb has is that prejudice of which I already spoke, and the approach to it by its V chord, which is something very familiar.

The Cm has musical emphasis because it's the first chord of the loop. And furthermore, in these loops, it's often the first chord that's the tonal center. 

So there is good support for either chord being the "key note".

But it totally depends on how the music is presented. If Cm is on the down beat, and Bb happens only on beat 3 of its measure, we might hear the Cm as being more emphasized.

If your MELODY ends on some note of a Gm chord, and sounds as if it "leave you hanging" but it sounds like it "resolves" to a note in the Cm chord every time, that's going to emphasize C.

This is like saying, "my dish contains water, pasta, oil, shrimp, and cheese".

Will it could be Shrimp Mac and Cheese, or it could be Shrimp Penne.

It depends on if the emphasis is on tons of Cheddar Cheese, or just a light dusting of Parmesan, and what kind of Pasta was used.

You've got "ingredients" here. But it's not a meal. Just because you "laid them out in order" doesn't do much more than list your ingredients according to some order you liked.

You need Rhythm, you need Melody. Those will help determine the "name of the dish" - the Key.

Otherwise, we have to wait until you put these ingredients together and see where the emphasis is to determine what key it is.

It could one of 4 likely candidates at this point. By "listing them" in this order, the first one on the list seems "most important" but if "Pasta" were listed 3rd we'd also assume you're making some kind of Italian inspired dish.

C Dorian

F Mixolydian

Bb Major

G Minor

And the "cadence" doesn't really matter at this point, because you don't really have one. The cadence would be the instructions on how to put the ingredients together to make one dish as opposed to another one - all you've got are ingredients that point to some possibilities.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I hope you meant "descending" for the Soprano.

C - B - A - A - G

A - B - C - D - G

The bass should not be jumping down from C to D.

From that standpoint, you can't adhere to the rules of <b><u>harmony</u></b> in your added voice because one of your existing voices has already broken the rules. If the Soprano is in fact ascending, then there's no point in making the tenor adhere to common practice because the other two voices already don't.

Assuming the bass and soprano follow their proper directions:

C - B - A - A - G

E - D - E - F# - D (or G unison with the upper G)

A - B - C - D - G

To get a B in the inner part, you'd probably want to start the bass an octave lower, then the F# could jump a 4th (not a 5th) to B.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>What's happening is, a set of notes on its own doesn't really necessarily have any definitive harmonic properties.

They could imply a number of harmonies.

But when you play a <b><u>harmony</u></b> before them, or with them, you then conceptualize the notes within that harmonic framework.

It's no different then playing C-D-E over a C chord, and C-D-E over an Am chord. One's going to sound Major, the other, minor.

Simply put, the "chord" wins out - no matter what the individual notes (or melody line, etc.) are, the chord you put with them is going to determine what the overall <b><u>harmony</u></b> is.

You're just hearing it happen in succession rather than simultaneously.

The thing around the C probably has a "Lydian-esque" sound to it, while the one around the E has more an E minor vibe.

However, they shouldn't sound higher in pitch (other than relative to the chord). They're the same notes. The chord should sound lower in pitch :-)

It's all based on "reference" to a <b><u>harmony</u></b>. The melody (the notes) take on a different "sound" in relation to the given <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

But there's nothing really going on here besides we use a system where <b><u>harmony</u></b> is dictated by all sounding notes and a "chord" can "overpower" a melody because it implies the <b><u>harmony</u></b> more completely.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You're overthinking it :-)

It's simply:

chord/bass note

C/E means a C chord with an E in the bass.

G/F means a G chord with an F in the bass. Yes, that's actually a G7, so you will also see G7/F as well.

The only funky kind of thing is, you might see something like G/Eb, or G/A.

Both of those could be "namable" chords, like "Ebmaj7#5" or A11, etc.

They're just written that way because it's a less convoluted symbol.

But, there are two additional things to consider:

First, sometimes people try to show when two things are happening - like a static bass line with moving chords above, or a static <b><u>harmony</u></b> with moving bass line.

A - C/A - D/A - E/A - G/A

or

C - C/B - C/Bb - C/A - C/Ab - C/G

The idea here is, A - Am6 - D/A - Amaj9 - A11 

or

C - Cmaj7/B - C7/Bb - Am7 - Abmaj7#5 - C/G

don't tell you what's REALLY going on musically.

Second, you see this is with pianists as they think RH/LH. To a pianist, a lot of times C/A means literally that - play a C triad in the RH with an A note in the LH.

If you put Am7, they're thinking a totally different way.

Both of these are kind of attempts to be somewhat more specific about voicings (which chord symbols really shouldn't do or be used for) but in this case it's showing bass movement against harmonic movement which is within the realm of what slash chords are mean't to do.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; Even basic things like <b><u>harmony</u></b> exercises are way easier sat at the keyboard with pencil, paper &amp; eraser than using software.

No doubt.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I suppose it depends on how you look at it.

For example, in contrapuntal forms, especially from the Baroque and earlier, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is often "resultant of the lines" rather than what tends to happen in the Classical and later - that the "lines are resultant of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>".

Obviously there's some crossover there and some fugues (and other contrapuntal forms) are more harmonically driven and some are more melodically driven.

In those Fugues that tend to be more melodically driven, you're much more likely to find "odd" or non-functional chord progressions.

What this might reveal is that not all CPP music is as harmonically driven as we are often misled to believe.

Likewise, there are 2 Part Fugues - how do they deal with <b><u>harmony</u></b> as compared to a 4 Part Fugue? A comparison of that could be revealing.

So if the question is, "should we analyze Fugues harmonically?" I'd say yes because there are things happening that our typical textbook learnin' doesn't show us.

I think as long as you go in without the preconception that they're going to fit the textbook model of harmonic progression, you'll be OK (of course, many pieces don't fit the model, but Fugues and other contrapuntal forms naturally deviate more and more commonly).

There's more to it than this, but I think that might have addressed the primary question.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;I understand the theory that a chord progression that strictly follows the circle of fifths will be strong.

Do you? Because that's not necessarily true.

Not to be snarky, but I'll say it yet again: **The Circle of 5ths has absolutely nothing to do with CHORD PROGRESSIONS** (but read on dear readers before wadding your panties).

It is merely a "listing of **KEYS**" arranged in a circle to show one particular attribute that Keys exhibit, which is those that are a 5th away in either direction differ by only one accidental.

And that is the exact reason that most songs progressions "jump around" that circle. Because they have nothing to do with the circle.

It's more a coincidence that sometimes, some chord progressions move by 4ths - which just happens to line up with the Keys represented on the circle.

But the Circles is about KEYS, not chords progressions.

OK, SOME chord progressions do in fact take advantage of the same aspects the order of the Circle exhibits - especially a string of Secondary Dominants.

But, vi - ii - V - I isn't really "moving around the circle" (because to do so, the keys would be Major).

That movement though is "up a 4th" (so I always say, "Cycle of 4ths" rather than Circle of 5ths) and that is in fact considered one of the strongest ROOT MOVEMENTS.

The "more general theory" - well, it's actually more specific - it's Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, or Functional Chord Progressions.

That is where your graph is coming from (though it's honestly a bit excessive).

Basically, chords fulfill a role, and one role for example is Dominant. The Dominant chord's role is to lead to the Tonic.

There are two chords with Dominant Function in a Key: V and vii^o .

We generally consider the V-I movement "strongest".

Where that comes from is counterpoint and voice-leading. In a V-I movement, the tonic is surrounded by two tones that "lead to it" an "collapse on it". In addition it has that strong root movement of an upward 4th. It also contains one tone that's common to both chords.

Another common root movements are up a 2nd (like C to Dm) which is kind of "stronger", but, since none of the notes are common it's also very "drastic".

Another is down a 3rd but it has TWO common tones. What this means is there's more "similarity of sound" between the two chords.

So it's kind of like Goldilocks - up a 2nd is too drastic, down a 3rd is not drastic enough, up a 4th is just right (combination of commonality, movement, and strength).

But all of these progressions are common in music, and even ones that go the "wrong way" (retrogression) are not unheard of. It just so happens that some of them are a 4th apart, which so too are Keys listed on the circle (I could add (I just did!) that the movement up a 5th is actually a "bad" progression - it's a retrogression, so "moving by 5th" is only good counterclockwise!!!).

Graphs like that, are not generated from "rules".

They're generated from observation.

We looked at countless songs and saw what they did.

Here is the common Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> progression chart for Common Practice Period music:

It may be handwritten, but it's right ;-)

The one you linked to is more for Jazz.

Use the Circle of 5ths for Keys. Not chords.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Outside of Jazz, which is distinctively American (at least at the outset), the more well known (at least in the past) American Composers tended to work in the Neo-Classical and Neo-Romantic genres. They also intentionally included Folk Songs that were if not American in origin, co-opted and had essentially become American. They set songs in English, and use texts by American Poets and Authors. They also used Patriotic themes and leaned more towards the American March tradition. Many even insisted on using English musical instructions and titles!

Obviously, all this came from "the old world" and many composers studied with teachers from the old world, and of course their influences were old world music.

And "American Concert Music" was kind of all over the place.

The "Father" of it all if you like is Aaron Copland.

His Ballets were American themed - Rodeo, Appalachian Spring (which incorporates Simple Gifts). Fanfare for the Common Man was commissioned by the Govt. for the 2nd World War.

His style is somewhat in the Neo-Classical vein, and he used a lot of Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

Many other American composers are associated with a similar model, and many leaned towards a more Pandiatonic style and less chromatic (certainly, all composer worked in a lot of genres though, but most of it was more Tonal, or Pantonal, or Modal, and Panmodal, or when chromaticism was used it tended to be to "shift" into new modes or pitch levels, not like chromatic romantic <b><u>harmony</u></b> or 12 tone tone rows).

You've heard this one before:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_7DA1G6tVs

Now of course, there were plenty of Experimental composers too, and many in film carried on the more Romantic period tradition (and were often expats from other countries).

Then there's the whole "American City Hustle and Bustle" kind of music that does incorporate Jazz elements (some of those I posted above certainly have more 7th chords, and syncopated rhythms).

But aside from obvious Jazz elements, I'd say the biggest things are Subject Matter (titles, texts, inclusion of folk songs, etc.) and that sort of Neo-Classical Pandiatonic style, at least in the first half of the 20th century.

John Cage, Charles Ives, Roy Harris, etc. were all American Composers, but they tended to be more experimental or are not best known for their "American" style of concert music composition (notice, I've avoided Gershwin and Bernstein because I feel like they veer as much to a "pop" side as Cage and Ives do to an experimental side).

Charles Ives certainly has the "americana" subject matter though. But his music is, shall we say, individualistic and not part of a more "American" trend.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The Eb in that Db chord might be another non-chord tone though...

You have to see it in context.

What you're doing is the "jazz way" which is to subsume every note you see into the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

But that isn't always the way music works (even jazz).

Melodic tones especially are not always chord tones (even in jazz, despite the way people analyze them a lot of times). Traditionally in fact, there are a LOT of notes in melodies that are not part of the prevailing <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

i would need to see the entire example.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Common Practice Period.

I think if most people heard this fugue, they might not even realize it's a fugue, because the music is very much like typical classical period string quartet writing (which in the hands of a master like Haydn can still be very contrapuntal). It sounds like imitative counterpoint, but otherwise, the whole vibe of it is more like typical functional chord progressions - and making the melodic motives bend to that.

Here's a Romantic Period one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVOf0Kr2nUM

Now, of course there are melodies, and melodic motives, but I mean that, for example, the Grieg does some of that more typical Romantic Period chromatic <b><u>harmony</u></b> which makes the melodic bits take on chromatic/sequential lines rather than the Subject itself "demanding" that (though Bach could certainly write a Subject to make the <b><u>harmony</u></b> do that - that's what I mean by the <b><u>harmony</u></b> "resultant" of the melodic lines).

With Bach, it's more of the typical "perpetual motion" and "unfolding" whereas the Haydn and Grieg can be more rhythmic and sectional.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6vF9owrxMo

Much of it is just stylistic difference too, but there is a general trend through the CPP from Baroque through Classical into Romantic where <b><u>harmony</u></b> is more "resultant" of independent contrapuntal lines in contrapuntal forms to melody being more resultant of harmonic moves later (in contrapuntal forms).

So it can be subtle, and vary from piece to piece in addition to composer to composer and time period to time period, but that's just a general trend.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The starting note makes no difference.

But, you keep saying melody. Are there no chords?

Melody is, in some way, like words - you need enough words...

.

.

.

.

in a sentence to make sense.

If you had a melody that was just a B note for example, there's just not enough information to tell what key it's in.

What makes a Key a certain Key is that "at rest" or what we usually refer to as the "home" note.

For that, you need enough musical information to cause there to be some kind of "emphasis" on that home note - because it's that musical emphasis that makes it sound like home in the first place.

To put it bluntly, you're not really in any key yet in your example with the notes G, B, and D. They're in a LOT of keys. 

What we'd most likely think is, without any additional information, that that melody is most likely in G Major, because those three notes are all part of a G Major chord.

So the assumption would be, G Major.

If I get you correctly, it actually sounds like you're picking a key first, then choosing notes.

That can be the way we do it, but really, if you pick Am as the key, you kind of either need some reason to do so - like some music you've already messed with that you've determined is in Am, so now you'll write the song in that context - or, you need to pick notes that definitively make it sound like A minor, and not something else.

That would be A, and the notes of the A minor triad, A-C-E, and an emphasis on those notes (starting and ending phrases, melody patterns made with exclusively or mostly them etc.)

A lot of music doesn't just have only melody. A melody by itself can determine the Key, but usually you've also got <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - chords - and even things like a Bass line.

All of these things work together to support the Key. Sometimes, one by itself can do it, but often, they don't (or are intentionally left open so they can work in a variety of musical settings).

_____

With auto tune, if they set it to Am, any notes they sing will be A B C D E F G.

So if they sing a B, it's going to be in tune with any B you have as an instrument sound in the piece. But, if all you have is G, B and D, then it's not going to sound like Am.

That may or may not make a difference depending on what they're doing.

But if you were to send someone a track and said "it's in Am" and all you had was a G chord, they'd probably think you don't know what you're doing.

But they could set the auto tune to Bm, or G, or C, or whatever and it would probably work OK. As long as the G, B, and D worked it would be OK.

Since your DAW is highlighting notes of Am if you write a melody, they could set it to Am or C and it would work. Because all it's doing is tuning anything to those notes which are the same for both.

But what you need to figure out is this "musical emphasis" I'm talking about, and how it makes a note sound like the "home" note. This is often easier to understand by using <b><u>harmony</u></b> rather than melody - because the melody is strung out over a longer time a lot of times.

But yeah, seems you need to learn more about how keys work.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;What can be said of musicians who perform only consonant tonal pieces?

That they've very few and far between.

Because there's no such thing as a "consonant" tonal piece. There's going to be dissonance in there somewhere - melodically at the very least. If there's <b><u>harmony</u></b> (which is 95% plus of all tonal pieces) it's going to be a 99% plus chance there's a dissonance there somewhere.

Here's a question for you: What about the people who hate tonal music because they've been told it's not adventurous, or the people who hate it just because of the sheer fact that everyone else likes it?

Believe it or not, there are people out there like that.

I always say, there are two kinds of people who don't like The Beatles: Those who truly just don't like The Beatles, and those who don't like The Beatles just because everyone else does.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;My evidence against this is that there are common musical characteristics found in virtually all cultures such as the use of the pentatonic scale.

Actually, this is a common statement, but it's not really backed up by any hard science. 

&gt;Clearly the importance of 5ths is naturally built into the universe which explains 2,5,1.

But again, this is not borne out in actual music.

Sure, absolutely, the "Jazz Mantra" is "2-5-1".

But barely any rock songs go 2-5-1. They just don't.

The "cop out" is to say, "well they just don't follow the natural order".

And it's also a cop out to say, "oh, these people who had <b><u>harmony</u></b> before they had 2-5-1, they just "hadn't been enlightened yet".

Since <b><u>harmony</u></b> developed in western music - ONLY - that means <b><u>harmony</u></b> itself is NOT universal. That means, 2-5-1 simply CAN'T be universal.

Again, it's a cop out to say, "oh, well 2-5-1 is universal, it's just that these "primitive" cultures didn't discover it yet. Hopefully you see where that leads.

Yes, but you understand other cultures didn't develop <b><u>harmony</u></b> or polyphony right?

&gt;Even monophonic lines imply <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Only in cultures where <b><u>harmony</u></b> even existed to begin with (which is largely, one culture). Yes, a Bach piece for solo Recorder - you can hear the harmonic changes.

But Gregorian Chant does not imply <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It was made before <b><u>harmony</u></b> even existed.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;It is my understand that if you play notes belonging to a key over chords of the same key, it should sound nice 

Yes, when it's a **KEY**.

There are only two "keys" - Major and Minor.

There is C Major, and there is C Minor.

You can use a C Major Scale over the chords in the KEY of C Major.

You can use a C Minor Scale over the chords in the KEY of C Minor.

But there's no "key" of "Mixolydian b6".

We have Major, and Minor.

There are 7 Modes, and since 5 of the diatonic modes work the same as Major and Minor, it's possible to do the same for them. For example, you can play the E Mixolydian Scale over chords from an E Mixolydian "Key" (Mode, but it's being used like a Key there).

Here's the thing. Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor aren't really "true scales". They are mnemonic devices to help people understand what goes on in minor KEYS. However, people being people, and not learning enough about music, misinterpreted that and starting trying to use them as stand-alone scales, and then started trying to apply rotations to them like we do with other modes.

The problem is, <b><u>harmony</u></b> was conceived before all this and it just doesn't work the way people want it to - that is, as it does for Major and Minor...or, and here's the important bit:

In Minor KEYS, we don't "use the harmonic minor scale". Instead, melodies and chords are derived from Natural Minor UNTIL we need a raised 7th scale degree - which happens in a Dominant function chord - V or vii^o

So we alter it for that ONE instance, not for everything.

In E Minor, you'd play the note D, until such time as a B or D#^o <b><u>harmony</u></b> arose, and that's when you'd change to D#.

The same is true of Melodic Minor (which is why it's different going up than down - not a "real" scale).

You alter 6 when you alter 7 going up, and then back to natural going down. Or again, we can say that the melodies and chords are derived from Natural Minor, until such time as a Dominant chord needs a raised 7, and if that is approached melodically, we raise 6 to.

That means scale degrees 6 and/or 7 are "variable" in minor Keys - we changed them "as needed", not all the time.

So when you try to apply this to what you're doing, it doesn't really work because Mixolydian b6 is a rotation of Melodic Minor (ascending form) which you really shouldn't be using. It would be the F# and G# that are being raised, but hear the E7 is not playing the role of a dominant function chord, instead it's acting as a Tonic.

IOW, the whole purpose of raising 6 and 7 (which are now 2 and 3) is for the functional role of making a leading tone in the V chord. By raising 2 and 3 you're functionally pointing to the Am as the Tonic.

And that would make both Bm and D7 "wrong" chords. The reason a D would be in Am is to lead to E - but it doesn't here. Likewise, Bm just doesn't happen commonly in Am.

______

Now, an additional problem: We are SO used to hearing these progressions as pointing to various keys and hearing minor the way we hear it that your progression really is going to be heard as either not pointing to Am like it should, or, just plain bad (in terms of a Key).

Instead, it's more of a "tonal shift" - a Sequential Progression. As u/FwLineberry points out, this is why Bm - E7 - Am - D7 or the reverse makes more sense - it's a Sequence.

And that means you'd probably treat each pair as being in a different key. E mixolydian than D mixolydian.

And the reason this "shift" occurs is because you can't really take a mode like Mixolydian b6 and apply it in this way.

______

Now, that said, you could absolutely create a chord progression from a scale rather than a key - but when you do so it really helps if the progression is not even remotely similar to a traditional key because we're so programmed to hear it that way we can't "unhear" it.

But, "improvising" in such a situation is really difficult because it kind of throws away all the strategies that more often work because they were conceived of in a more functional progression setting.

Now, of course, any improv can work best if you know the notes of all the chords and change them accordingly - so you could have a "base" scale and then change notes as necessary to accommodate odd harmonies - I mean, that's EXACTLY how traditional minor works (we change that one note on one function which makes it "Harmonic Minor", but otherwise it's just plain minor).

So that might be the approach that's called for here (if you didn't use a Sequential one). E Mixolydian would be fine over the first two chords, but you change the C# to C for the D7 chord and the Am chord.

(but you could just play chord tones of course - that works all the time).

_____

This goes back to the common question we see here all the time - "what key am I in".

Well, you're not in a key. And, it's OK. Many songs have chords that go out of key. You just deal with them on a case by case basis - alter the notes of the scale to fit the odd chord, or pull a scale from where that chord comes from (which sometimes amounts to the same thing) and so on.

But if you draw your chords from something that's not from a key to begin with, it's going to produce chords out of the key. And that's what traditional minor does - if you draw a chord from Harmonic Minor (which is actually backwards thinking but bear with me) it messes up one of your chords - and you have to change your natural minor scale to harmonic minor *for that chord*.

So when you use something other than a Major or Minor Key, or one of the other 5 diatonic modes, you have to adjust accordingly usually on a chord by chord basis.

Sometimes - things work out and a scale will fit over a couple of chords - a pair, or trio in succession - but at some point you get a conflict.

But when you're improvising, even if you hit on a lucky combination, you may not remember what you did later and don't really ever learn which things work and which don't - outside of trial and error (which you could do in advance at home and learn though).

So even though you drew these chords from a scale, that scale was originally designed as a "variable" scale rather than a fixed one, and to our tonally conditioned ears, it will be "less natural to deal with" - and that variation in the scale happens over the span of a couple of adjacent notes so can be expected to affect a couple of chords. That's why the "sequential" approach might be better in this case, because when you shift from E Mix to D Mix look what happens:

E F# G# A B C# D E

E F# (G) A B (C) D 

Only the G and C change. And the C is going to sound good over the D7 and Am - it's in both chords. And the G might sound "better" in the sense that it's the same relationship to D7 and Am that the A in the E mix is to Bm and E7. It will sound like a shift - a sequence.

But that's not something you might realize in a jam situation! Especially if you pulled the chords from a known scale. But hopefully you see you could have drawn the two chords from two pairs of chords in two keys a 2nd apart (or two modes) so when improvising and using a "scale based" approach - and trying to deal with Keys as a larger concept (or modes in this case) it could have just as easily come from here - which makes soloing over it require the same approach.

Final disclaimer - you could still get it to work "as is" by really being careful about picking your notes - but hey, would could say that about the chromatic scale and any chord choices ;-)

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I would do Tonal first. Despite it being later chronologically, it's probably going to be a lot closer to more things you're already familiar with - you're going to be stepping out of your comfort zone but let's say Tonal is 1 step, while Modal is 4 or 5 steps. Doing the Tonal first will at least make learning Modal counterpoint slightly less out of your comfort zone once you know the Tonal stuff.

IOW, rather than "jumping back in time" to the 16th century and then moving chronologicially forwards, you just move backwards through time - you may already have a handle on Classical Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, so Baroque (Tonal) Counterpoint moves that a step back in time to some degree, then Renaissance (Modal) Counterpoint goes another step (or 3 or 4 :-) back.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Louder, more "full".

It also allows for things like having Flutes in 3 part <b><u>harmony</u></b>, which isn't available with just a pair.

But it's also partly an ego thing, especially through the Romantic period - each composer felt the need to "out do" prior composers.

And obviously adding more winds without increasing the strings makes the sound more wind-heavy when all are playing. But usually, people up the numbers of strings as well (and there is more percussion added, and things like Harp, etc.)

It's like an artist's palette with more colors on it. It's more orchestral colors and combinations available.

Jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b> is an entirely different ball game.

If you studied typical "Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" of the CPP in your theory courses in college, then it's going to be an about-face for Jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

If you really want to learn it, you need to immerse yourself in the style, learn to play the tunes, study songs and arrangements, and work with some great musicians and teachers.

There are tons of materials out there of varying quality - Ted Greene's "Chord Chemistry" is mentioned a lot (especially on guitar forums) and then there's the stalwart "Lydian Chromatic Concept".

But it really depends on what you want to do with this stuff - you really need to play the music - not sure if you do or what your music degree involved since you didn't say.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes, enormous topic.

Simply put, one is Tonal, the other is Modal :-)

They are different STYLES too though, but 18th century style can be seen as an evolution of 16th century style.

In the 18th c. Instrumental music was gaining in popularity so many of the 16th c. style restrictions in place for voice were relaxed in instrumental (and vocal in some cases) writing.

However, one thing we don't really do in 16th c. style is analyze it chord-chord-chord-chord like we do with Bach Chorales (which are the model for part-writing, though not specifically polyphonic counterpoint - exemplified in fugal writing). So we can kind of say 18th c. has a large Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> component, which of course goes along with Keys, and thus Tonality, while 16th c. is more "consonance-based" <b><u>harmony</u></b> where not combinations are dictated by melodic lines with less concern as to which harmonies are produced, only that they are consonant (or dissonant ones resolve to consonant, etc.). There are also all kinds of melodic and even rhythmic formula.

But Baroque part-writing practice did evolve out of Renaissance part-writing. And even though the names make it seem as if there was a century gap, that's not really the case. It's more a gradual evolution and Bach and Palestrina were chosen as the two primary examples and the century they flourished in gave it the name (which is why some prefer just Modal and Tonal).

What you might want to do is get both of Robert Gauldin's books. They have the same title with the century different: "A Practical Approach to 16th (or 18th) Century Counterpoint".

They're both much better texts for better insight into the actual musical practices - style, form, approach, etc. of each era. They make nice companion books and having both kind of allows you to compare back and forth. They're not horribly expensive as I recall. And they are "practical approaches" - designed to help you learn how to WRITE counterpoint in those styles as well.

You might want to watch Elam Rotem's series on YT - it's REALLY informative and really well done. Here's one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyq48eybjZw

By contrast - though this moves into more "Classical" realms, he takes a great approach by even calling it "Harmonic Species" - showing that the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is (or has become) a more "organizational component" in the 18th c. and later styles. This video has some comparisons with older music too (what's REALLY a shame is that people don't want to compose like Machaut, which to me is WAY cooler than Palstrina or Bach!):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXXVpYsDdY

He also has this series which is maybe not as relevant to your point, but worth checking out, because he does go into harmonic function and how that evolves into the Classical period:

If you're not trying to emulate Bach, it has maybe a few issues.

I agree that the first note should be harmonized - it typically is - Bach or not Bach, unless it's a pickup note - and that's what it comes off sounding like (sometimes pickup notes are harmonized as well, but it's more common to have pickups without <b><u>harmony</u></b> than it is just to have a first note like this).

The "open" (incomplete) chords are a "stark contrast".

You've named a chord "Ab(add7)". It should just be Abmaj7. That's something you should really already know by now, and that concerns me about what other gaps there are in your knowledge - again if this is supposed to Bach style, then there are lots of those gaps.

I don't understand why all (or most) beats aren't labelled with a chord? Why is chord 2 in measure 2 not labelled? Why is only the Ab in the first measure?

The other things people are saying would also be appropriate in Bach style, but it's not clear if that's what you're actually going for or not.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Obviously, if you planned to major in music, that would help!

But I realize you may have some time yet before you do that.

Still, you could go to a university and possibly take classes - or a community college - as a non-degree seeking student for example.

The more important question is WHY you want to expand your knowledge?

Of course, expanding knowledge is always a good thing, but do you have specific goals in mind?

Some coursework at the university level would be ideal, or some private lessons that make use of theory in a way that basic Piano Lessons don't (i.e., more theory/<b><u>harmony</u></b>/composing/arranging based than performance practice/technique/repertoire based).

Beyond that it's all going to be work on your own - buying books and reading them, websites, etc.

This is probably the single best resource on "Classical <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" I've found online. You can jump around but it's probably worth starting at the beginning just to make sure you don't miss anything - and there's a lot of useful information in here beyond the "raw theory" - it shows it more in a MUSICAL context, which is super important - and that's why "self teaching" can be bad, because you just get raw information (in no logical order) without any useful context.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk6K6rwyo0c

But you can learn other stuff - pre-tonal stuff - post-tonal stuff, other musical styles (Jazz, Blues, etc) which all have their own specifics.

Depends on what you're interested in - and, what your goals are.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There is no directional in anything.

You have to first put it in some kind of context. And then, only if there is an understood (long-standing/existing) directionality for that chord would it take it on.

For example, in CPP music, an Augmented triad is most often encountered in two primary forms: As a chromatic alteration of a chord, and as an "augmented dominant".

The former is found commonly in progressions like I - I+ - vi^6 - which is your C+ to Am/C

The latter is like V - V+ - I, or G - G+ - C in the key of C.

Those could be secondary dominants like:

I - V+/IV - IV (C - C+ - F in the key of C).

In CPP style, Augmented Triads are comparatively rare as "stand alone" chords, and most often arise from chromatic voice leading like those examples above. It's not until later into the Romantic Period that you start to see composers using the Augmented Triad as a "stand alone" chord both as Augmented Dominants and as free "color" chords with no functional considerations. In the former, the Augmented Dominant would resolve as it did previously in the style (G+ - C as V+ - I) but without the preparation. In the latter, we again have the "context" issue it has no "directionality" - and that's where it, like the o7, begins to take advantage of its symmetry and "rootlessness" and ambiguity - remember that the + Triad has a bit of an edge because it doesn't really naturally occur in CPP music in a key (the understanding many have that it's "part of harmonic minor" is not really accurate), and was rare to begin with, and appeared only in rather specific contexts - while the o7 was a much more familiar sonority much earlier on. So in the quest for a "new" sound - the + triad was the "freshest" at the time.

Since such chords didn't arise from voice-leading, and consonance/dissonance constructs that created contextual directionality in Dominant function chords and other "voice-leading chords" (+ created by chromatic alteration, +6 chords, cto7 chords, etc.), they don't have "directionality" in any reasonable contextual sense.

This of course ties in later with the use of the Whole Tone Scale, and many see those types of + Triads as being "derived" from there rather than the existing traditional system (so, new context, new contextual role, which is just about "sound" rather than function). This becomes relevant:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=962lHSUXxI8

What you're seeing is, Augmented Triads "came into being" first through chromatic alteration of a chord tone (the 5th) as a LINEAR chromatic Passing Tone (so they weren't "true" chords at that point) and gradually moved from a "dependent" <b><u>harmony</u></b> to a "stand alone" <b><u>harmony</u></b> where that chromatically altered note began to be used in a functional role in some contexts (though the non-functional linear role remained available as well).

Eventually, things moved even further into "stand alone" territory where the chord become "a completely vertical sonority" if we like, no longer dependent on its origins as a linear chord.

So it kind of is like, Linear (not a chord) - &gt; Hybrid (chord, but still showing it's linear origins) - &gt; Vertical (chord, but no longer dependent on linear origins).

That would be, C+ moving to Am then G+ moving to C, then C+ moving wherever the hell it wants :-)

This "evolutionary emancipation" is actually true of MOST chords - especially those with dissonances - 9th chords in Bach appear almost exclusively as the result of linear motion, and the 9th itself in most cases really isn't even a chord tone. It takes until Beethoven for the 9th to start being used more in a "stand alone" capacity - same deal - unprepared, but still resolves. Then we see it in the Debussy capacity - as a stand alone <b><u>harmony</u></b> with no need of resolution that can be planed for example.

One of the wonderful things about music seems to be that as these things evolve, the older things don't necessarily go away or lose their importance. So we can STILL use an Augmented Triad as a linear thing (and a modern interpretation of that is its use in the Line Cliché), AND we can use them as Functional Chords in their Dominant role (which still happens a lot in Jazz and even pop tunes) and we can use them as "free" sonorities (without all that "directionality" baggage;-)

What I think is important for us as composers/performers etc. is to be as aware as we can of the various contexts and take advantage of the properties the context imbues on the chord (or note, etc.) and know the "sound" and "typical use" of each so when we want to use them for those purposes, we can.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No, the 4th degree of the major scale is not dissonant.

There is Harmonic Dissonance, Melodic Dissonance, and Contextual Dissonance in music.

**Harmonic Dissonance** is when an **Interval** is formed either as a Harmonic Interval (two notes sounding at the same time) or a Melodic Interval (two notes one after another). In this context, we take Melodic Intervals and "figure them as" Harmonic Intervals - so the interval of E over C is the same as a C note being followed by an E note. We take the two notes in succession of a Melodic Interval and "stack them up" into a Harmonic Interval to figure out what they are and classify them.

In this context, Major and Minor 2nds and 7ths are dissonant, as well as the Tritone.

C to D (or Db) is dissonant, as is C to B (or Bb).

C to E (or Eb), G, A (or Ab) are all consonant.

**Melodic Dissonance** is not what we usually talk about instead of being "true" consonance and dissonance refers to notes in a melody. In essence, "consonance" here means "singable".

Melodies are FULL of 2nds - but they are not "dissonant" because they're not really being used in a Harmonic fashion (and even though we stack up Melodic Intervals to class them, we don't think of actual Melodies this way).

Historically, Major and Minor 2nds and 3rds, the Perfect 4th and 5th, and the Minor 6th were all considered "consonant" - or "good" Melodic Intervals for Melodies. Basically, the larger the interval, the hard it is to sing. The *Major* 6th is often quoted as being too hard to sing and is often not included as a "consonance" in this context. But these are historical rules from early counterpoint. James Tenney's book "History of Consonance and Dissonance" does a great job of telling how these terms were used before the advent of <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

**Contextual Dissonance** has to do with - as you would guess - context. Readers may have noticed I avoided using the terms "augmented and diminished" above.

That is because in a absolute sense, C# to Ab is a Dissonance because it can not be created diatonically. BUT, enharmonically (ignoring tuning gradients here) it is a **Consonance** - A Perfect 5th.

So what we usually say is, "all 2nds and 7ths, and any Augmented or Diminished interval is Dissonant".

That's **in practice**. But, we can see some intervals used harmonically and melodically that are actually Consonances. The +2 formed between b6 and raised 7 in minor keys (Like Ab to B natural) is considered a Dissonance in Melodic terms - it's "hard to sing", but again, it's enharmonically a Minor 3rd, so from a Harmonic point of view, it's fine, but it's this **context** - it being spelled as +/o (or otherwise being non-diatonic) that creates a problem - where none really exists so to speak :-)

The Perfect 4th is a special case.

Melodically, it's fine. C followed by F (in the key of C) is not a "dissonance". It's a perfectly acceptable melodic interval - from any scale degree to any other scale degree, so long as it's a Perfect 4th.

That's why it's listed as "OK" under the melodic bit, but not the harmonic bit.

So yo are confusing these two uses (or rather, aren't aware of the distinction).

Harmonically speaking, the Perfect 4th has been more impacted than any other interval **contextually**.

It started as a Consonance (early Parallel Organum). In the Common Practice Period however, the P4 became a **dissonance** in relation the the **Bass** note, but not in relation to other notes. So the chord C-F-A was considered "dissonant" (or unstable) because the P4 is formed between the Bass note and some other voice. But, A-C-F was considered consonant (or stable, not in need of resolution) because the P4 does not involve the Bass.

After the CPP, the P4 was considered Consonant again.

So you can't ask "is the P4 consonant" because the answer is "it depends on the context".

And maybe another way to say this is that, it doesn't really matter if the P4 is truly dissonant or consonant in any absolute sense, because consonance and dissonance **IN MUSIC** is about **musical practice**. So what we can say is, in many cases, even if an interval is consonant, it may be **treated** as if it were dissonance, and vice versa. The P4 between the bass and an upper part might be consonant, but composers of the CPP *treated as if it were a dissonance*. The interval of an +2 might be an absolute consonance as an enharmonic m3 out of context, but composers *treated it as if it were a dissonance*.

_____

For your example, we don't treat a melody that goes up from scale degree 1 to scale degree 4 as a dissonance. And it's not even considered one because it's "melodically acceptable" and can be found commonly in practice. Likewise, a melody that goes up a 2nd is found REALLY COMMONLY in practice. We don't go around calling 2nds in a melody "dissonances" even though *harmonically* we class them that way.

And that difference is because of **how they are used in music**  harmonically versus melodically, and in various context (and that means some intervals are always dissonant, some always consonant, and some variable depending on the context in CPP music at least).

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are only 7 letter names. Any more notes than that, you have to use one twice. Also, just 3 notes in a row chromatically can cause issues.

Sometimes, if you have two chords, you can "compile" a scale from their notes.

C7 - D7 gives you C-D-E-F#-G-A-Bb-(C) which produces the Overtone Scale, or "#4 b7" scale, or various other names (Lydian Dominant, Mixolydian #4, etc.)

When you play the chord progression it's possible the notes that aren't in the chord will work OK over it - in this case since they're 2nds between the notes, they may work better than some other combinations.

But some pairs of chords are going to produce more duplicate notes:

C7 and E7 would give you C-D-E-(E)-G-G#-Bb-B

So even though there's a duplicate E that "frees up a note", there are still 7 different letter names, but 3 are in chromatic succession.

It gets kind of silly to do C-D-E-Fx-G#-A#-B just to solve those problems.

In an actual playing situation many of us might approach that as an E Blues - I7 to bVI7, so E-G-G#-Bb-B all work as chord tones and blue notes (G and Bb being blue notes in E) and the D is the b7 (also a blue note). So sort of the only odd one from that perspective is the C note.

So I'd rather see that all spelled  like I did the first time - C D E G G# Bb B makes much more sense to me as a player and in that context - which is really what it should be about

There is something called The Composite Blues scale which is a but like u/johnofsteel describes - it's not really a scale per se, but a collection of notes derived from the chords that can be used or altered depending on the musical needs.

A great example is traditional Harmonic and Melodic Minor - HM and MM aren't "really" scales but instead show you which notes can be varied for harmonic or melodic purposes, and how they're varied.

If you were to look at a piece of minor key music you'd see something like

C D Eb F G Ab A Bb B as the scale.

But that's not REALLY what's happening in the music - all of the chords aren't being drawn from that set - it's more limited than that.

Same thing with the composite blues scale - you would typically play b3 and 3 on the I chord, but on the IV chord you'd typically avoid the 3 and only play b3.

So the scale changes based on the <b><u>harmony</u></b> of the moment. They are scale degrees with multiple states.

So sometimes it's not really worth thinking about "deriving all the chords from a scale" or "building a scale out of the chord tones". It can work, and can provide internal logic and connections, but there's a lot of music that's not really made that way and notes are used for other reasons than just "being in the scale".

Think of it - we use chromatic notes all the time in music - but they're not in the scale right?

So we don't just tabulate them and call them the scale. Otherwise most pieces would always be the full chromatic scale right?

It's not really modulation in this case, but just a case by case variation - and this happens all the time in music as well. You're in C Major, and have an E7 chord that resolves to Am, which moves to G7 and back to C. You haven't really modulated - it's "Mostly in C" and your melody notes would come from C major. The one out of key chord has one out of key note - the G#. So on that chord you use G# instead of G. That's all.

It becomes a little trickier when you do as you've done - which is put two out of key chords in alternation (or 3 even). That can often take a little more trial and error because it depends on the relationship between the two chords - and don't forget, any one chord appears in multiple keys, so we wouldn't know if a Cmaj7 was coming from C or G (or Em or Am) so if it's in alternation with an Ebmaj7 - which could be 4 others, we have to decide which of the "filler notes" (if any - the non chord tones) are the notes that are chromatic alterations, or "inserted" notes - and that is all based on the sound you want!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Professors want you to buy specific editions because when we're in class and say "turn to page 47 and look at example 2" and someone goes, "my book doesn't have any examples on page 47" you waste 10 minutes of your - and the other students' - class time!

Sometimes there are significant upgrades, other times not. What often changes is the layout and appearance, as well as size of examples (some newly engraved for example) rather than the specific content.

Once we reached the digital era, there were more "add ons" - workbook assignments, recordings, website supplementary materials and things like that. The textbook companies kind of try to force people to buy the latest editions so they can keep all that stuff on the same "upgrade schedule" if you like. So if you buy an older book and try to look at something from another edition's materials, they might not match up or you won't be able to access them, etc.

In some cases, it might be cool to find an old edition of the Piston - before DeVoto started updating it, just to have Piston's own words so to speak. But DeVoto has been updating it for a while and that's what anyone who uses it would likely use, but it's kind of behind the others in terms of being "current".

I agree that they all do repeat similar information but from different perspectives (which I see as a good thing).

I found the Piston very "readable" in an old-school textbook kind of way, which was refreshing because many of the newer books have so many side-bars that they're distracting. Kids today. :-)
Anyhoo...Robert Gauldin's book is a great perspective IMHO. I know Vornska doesn't care for Kostka and Payne but I actually really like that - as a *classroom* book. It's more designed for the instructor than the students in a way - but as a teacher that's useful. So that's kind of a more different approach than the others mentioned. I never really liked the A/S - I guess because I read the K/P and Gauldin first, the A/S just didn't seem to really offer anything special. I did like the C/M primarily because of the look and organization - when I got it the first time, it was the first time I could ever describe a Theory text as "Sexy" - and that's something you don't really think about in theory texts! I don't mean of course that it was all looks and no substance, but it was just "more modern" and "hip" and "21st century" compared to a lot of the others that have just been updated since the 60s or so. I think though it spurred a lot of the others to step into (or be dragged into) the 21st century as well so they're probably all more on a level playing field again.

So they're kind of worth having largely for the way information is presented and the differing approaches and perspectives of the authors, but I wouldn't go dropping $100+ on any of them TBH. The Gauldin maybe, but the others, not really.

You might find some other similar material interesting, like Rameau's Treatise on <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - it's from 1722 (or 1725 I always get it mixed up with Gradus ad Paranassum) and kind of a cool look into the thinking of that time.

Obviously you can also move out of tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> and into post tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> and there are some "must have" books for that as well.

Depends on where you want to explore.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Maybe even better, would be the "musician" method of finding a key ;-)

Key takes two things:

"Center" - a note or <b><u>harmony</u></b> that sounds like "home" or that everything "comes to rest on" or "gravitates toward" and so on.

"Note Set" - a set of notes or chords specific to that key.

There is also "circumstantial evidence" and that's where you should begin.

1. Often, in modern popular music, the first chord is the tonic chord. If the first chord is G, then it's very likely the piece (or at least that section of the piece) is in G.

2. Also often, still in modern popular music but definitely in classical music, the final chord is the tonic chord (it's extremely rare for a classical piece to not end on the tonic chord!). If a piece (or section) ends on a D chord, in classical music, there's a 99.9% chance it's in D Major, and in popular music, there's still a good chance it's D.

3. If a piece both starts AND ends on the same chord, then there's a really good chance that it's the Tonic!

4. If a chord appears more frequently than other chords, then it is likely the Tonic chord. If that coincides with a starting and/or ending chord, that's even more evidence that it's probably the Tonic. However, in general, starting and ending chords are generally more important because of:

5. Musical Emphasis - all of the above are forms of emphasis - starting, ending, or both, or frequency all make that chord "more important" than other chords. All 3 combined is almost a certainty. However there are other forms of emphasis as well, such as the sound of resolution and so on.

What you do is look at the evidence in front of you and then see if you can find facts to substantiate that.

If a piece has a chord progression like G - D - Em - C, you could figure it was either in G or C. Assuming this is a pop piece, G is the more likely candidate, so you then see if G sounds like "home" and sounds "resolved" - could the piece end on that - IOW, if you play through to C, then just play another C after that, does that sound any more or less "final" than if you end with a G chord.

Likewise, and maybe more importantly, the note and chord content: If the Key is G Major, then the vast majority (if not exclusively, so you start there) of the notes and chords will be from the key of G Major.

G Major has the notes G A B C D E F# and the chords G Am Bm C D Em F#^o

Chords are made of "every other letter" so even though we don't have some chords, we have G-B-D, D-F#-A, E-G-B, and C-E-G - that is exclusively the notes from G Major and nothing else.

But even if you didn't know that, knowing that all 4 chords are from G, and G is the starting chord, and if it sounds like G is also the "home" chord, then it's a pretty safe bet to say yes, this is the key of G.

Of course what this means is, you have to know what chords are in each key.

________

Also, there is a bit of a caveat here: There is one minor key for each Major key that shares the exact same notes.

A song that goes Em - C - G - D - that's the same 4 chords as above but the emphasis is now on the Em as the starting chord. Sometimes, if you use the "resolve" method, the last D at the end will sound just as good going to a G chord - better even than maybe an Em chord.

But that "starting chord" emphasis is more important in pop music.

Popular music also uses Modes, and these work a similar way - they will have the same note content as some major key, but the emphasis will be on a different note.

Also, it's super super common in pop music to use chords from outside the key. Something like "Hey Joe" goes through a number of chords that could be found in either E Major **or** E Minor, but not really both.

But, because this idea of "musical emphasis" is so important, we say the song is "in E" and just uses chords from both E keys

Now, these last two points get into areas that most musicians (those without formal education (and even some with!), self-taught people, and "ear players") just don't know.

And the problem is, people will want to learn those songs and can't explain them.

Take an easy song like "G-L-O-R-I-A" by Them. It's E E D A throughout.

From a "note exclusivity" standpoint, it looks like the key of A Major - and many people who've learned "the IV and V chords are both major, so if you find two major chords a letter apart so they have to be IV and V, which tells you what I is" will come up with A (D would be IV, and E would be V, so that would make A I, and therefore the Tonic).

But that song just beats you over the head with E. And that's because it's not in a "key" in the traditional sense, but more accurately described as mode - E Mixolydian.

____

So what I'd do if I were you is when things line up and agree - starting chord, sounds like it, correct note/chord content - then go with the key you think.

But if there's a question, come on a forum like this and ask, because it may not always be in a Key in a traditional sense. And there is music that's not even really in a single key, so that throws another wrench in the works.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It does, but if that's the sound you want, that's how you get it :-)

Don't forget that Modal Composers and Tonal Composers both used Counterpoint and the results are very different. Furthermore, even the way Baroque Counterpoint and Classical Counterpoint are used produce different sounds - as I was saying in the other response, there are certain characteristics they maintain (identity of melodic lines within a harmonic texture they're all part of) but stylistically, they're different.

Let's take a band like Queen for example. Yes, much of what they do definitely has a "classical" (for lack of a better term) quality to it because they do use counterpoint in a similar kind of way (and IMHO, intentionally so because that's the sound they really wanted).

But if you listen to something like the middle section of "Prophet Song" or the way Brian May interweaves guitar lines in otherwise thick "orchestral like" textures (he plays a lot of single line stuff, or combined <b><u>harmony</u></b> lines on guitar) you'll get a sense of how those principles can still work in a rock style.

Just for example, if you're a guitarist, you can record a chord progression by playing 4 note chords on a single track. Or you can play 4 tracks of single note melodies that produce the same chords. They're going to sound very different in the result.

While that's the same part writing and counterpoint, the methodology produces a different result - and that same analogy can be extended to bass lines that simply follow the lowest note of the guitar part along, or that produce a true counterpoint - different result in the sound.

Right tool for the job. Helps if you buy the right tools, or else you either can't do the job or do a shoddy job of it!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you want to compose, you might be interested in books like Orchestration, and Counterpoint as well (in addition to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> books). Also, books on specific things, like "Fugue" by Alfred Mann can be interesting.

But I'd say definitely put the Vincent Persichetti high priority if composing is an interest for you.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>They "work" (sound right) because you've heard them millions of times before.

Historically, the 7th of a 7th chord needed to resolve down a step.

The G note in the Am7 would have to resolve down to the F# in the D chord.

You could just get to the D chord and be fine, but it's also super common to "maintain the tension" across two chords, by making the chord of a resolution a chord that, itself, needs to resolve. And you do so by adding a 7th to it.

It may sound a bit "quirky" to you but the chances are it's only because you are less familiar with that sound.

The V7 "should" resolve to I - not I7 (or Imaj7, or i7).

And that's because of what's happening above - if you keep moving to new "unstable" chords (by adding a 7th to each), then each is going to push to resolve to the next chord. Basically you're taking a "dissonant" (unstable) chord that needs to resolve, and rather than resolving it to a "consonant" (stable) chord, you make the chord it would have resolved to an unstable variant, which then repeats this vicious cycle :-)

Now, in Jazz, things are slightly different because in many contexts 7th chords are considered **stable** and you are able to have them be a "chord of resolution" without the tension that demand further resolution. So a I7 or Imaj7 or i7 or even I6 or I6/9 could all be chords without any tendency to move on.

Something that might be happening for you is that your ear may either be more used to hearing those 7th chords as stable, or more used to hearing them as unstable, which may be confusing your ear (and your brain) as to whether they should resolve or not, and thus whether they "sound right" or not.

______

So yes, the concept of "resolution" is that you move from a chord with "more tension" to one with "less tension" (or no tension).

Since historically, Major or Minor Triads (fifth chords) were more stable than any 7th chord - which back then was always unstable, that is considered the "strongest" resolution - moving from unstable to stable.

However, even then it was still possible to take the chord of resolution and make it an unstable <b><u>harmony</u></b> to continue to push the cycle forward.

In more modern styles of music where the 7th chords are not necessarily considered "unstable" we still often talk about "resolution" (which is really not the correct word) for when chords progress functionally, or the voice-leading works like it used to, but it's not really a "release of tension" because there isn't really any tension to begin with.

_______

In the olden days, a 7th had to resolve down by step. To use your example, the C in a D7 chord would have to resolve down to B in the key of G.

That means that it could move to a Bm chord, a G chord, or an Em chord. D7 to Em is a deceptive resolution, and D7 to G is the typical "authentic" resolution. D7 to B wasn't common in Common Practice music but happened prior in Modal music.

The D7 to G is "circle of 5ths" but the Circle of 5ths is about KEYS not chord progressions. It just happens to be in 5ths, so any chord progression in 5ths will also map on to it. But as you see from the D7 to Em, it doesn't have to move that way - or we could say, it could move from the "outer rim to the inner rim" of the circle (major to relative minors). But it's really best not to make that association.

Also, historically, while you might make a chord of resolution a dissonant chord itself, you wouldn't resolve a dissonant note to another dissonant note - so D7 wouldn't got to Cmaj7 - because the dissonant C in the D7 chord would be "resolving" (or really, not resolving) to a note that was dissonant (the 7th of the Cmaj7 chord, B). This was a no-no.

So given those restrictions, really the "only" way a 7th chord could resolve "properly" was to a chord a step above (G7 - Am) or a chord a 4th above (G7 to C).

_____

But when we get out of Common Practice Period music, things start to get used way more freely and 7th chords are treated as stable chords with no need to resolve at all in a lot of cases.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;People always talk about how modal music, like modal jazz is written based on modes, not chords.

What people?

I think you're taking something too literally.

The mode can dictate which chords are used.

For example, you could have a "Modal Vamp" in a "Modal Jazz" piece that goes from i7 - IV9 - what we'd call a "Dorian Vamp" and the reason that it's not I and IV, or i and iv like it would be with a Major or Minor scale is that you're "generating" your chords from Dorian, giving you a minor i and major IV.

But, yes, when you're writing melodies and improvising, you're essentially going to be using the Dorian Mode on your i to "generate" melodies.

But the context all this is happening in is still a "Melody With Accompaniment" kind of texture - Homophony - where the "harmonic importance" as the accompaniment element - especially in a Jazz context where you "play over the chords" - is going to make the <b><u>harmony</u></b> seem like the "glue" that holds it all together.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So let's say you're doing 2 against 1 counterpoint.

You have half notes in the lower part.

C - D

And you're going to have quarter notes over that, so the notes on the half note beats need to be consonant with the C and the D, beats 1 and 3. Beat 2 can either be consonant or dissonant, assuming of course it's an allowed dissonance.

A - G - F

C -  - D

is two consonant notes over the C.

C - B - A

C -  - D

would be consonances over the C and D, but the B as a Passing Tone (ignore the fact we probably wouldn't want an octave in many cases).

A chordal skip would be when you have a consonant note of the chord on beat 1 then leap (skip) to another note of the chord. Originally these would have both been consonances but when we get into counterpoint where <b><u>harmony</u></b> is a bigger factor (by that I mean, approaching things in chordal terms rather than just raw consonance terms) it's going to jump to a chord tone.

E - G - F

C - - - D

So the G here is a chordal skip (we're assuming the <b><u>harmony</u></b> on the C chord is a C Major chord for example).

sometimes in this context, the "real" or "underlying" motion is seen as E to F over C to D, with the G acting like a non-chord tone, but it happens to be both consonant and (assuming an implied C chord) a chord tone - hence a "consonant chordal skip".

So the reason for this is, most of the other dissonant motion is by step only, and even some of that might be consonant. This gives you a way to break up the melodic contour at - in our example - the quarter note value in addition to the half not level.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No, not really.

And it's not even as black and white as you're making it - I've never heard anyone ever say anything about the mediant in the Tonic chord - the Tonic chord's tonic function is due to the Tonic being present as the Root. I mean, I'd have to say you were just making that up and misunderstood something or someone else just made it up and you read it...

The only thing I can think of like you're describing is "Tendency Tones" - which itself is not black and white and not really a great thing in the actual context of music.

But the deal is, 1-3-5 don't have any strong tendency to resolve anywhere other than 1, as members of the Tonic triad (these are scale degrees, not chords).

2-4-6-7 all have a "tendency" to resolve to one of the tonic chord scale degrees - usually by the shortest past.

7, the Leading Tone, has a tendency to move to the 1, the Tonic

6 tends to want to go to 5

4 tends to want to go to 3

and 2 tends to want to go to 1, but can also go to 3.

When we alter those notes in the direction they would normally go, their tendencies are "heightened" - so in Minor, raised 7 (also the Leading Tone) wants more strongly to go to 1. b6 wants more strongly to go to 5. We don't really change 4 or 2 in Major/Minor keys, but b2 in the Neapolitan wants more strongly to go to 1.

However, this shouldn't not be taken too literally - for example, if you put the "leading tone" as the 7th of a Imaj7 chord, it no longer has a tendency to ascend to the Tonic, but as a dissonant 7th wants to resolve down to 6 (it sort of "transposes" the tendency of 4-3 as in V7-I - so see it's all based on context).

____

Such connections are superfluous and have so many exceptions it's not really worth putting too much faith in them. Yes, sort of "the" note in the Dominant is the Leading Tone, but that's really about as far as I'd take those kinds of connections.

Functionally speaking, when 7ths are added the 7th is a far more "driving force" - as my example with the Tonic - C-E-G is as stable as you can get in the key of C and is the point of resolution, stability, and "home" with no tendency to go anywhere else. It's "tonic-ness" in terms of function really comes from it being the Tonic Triad and the Tonic note being it's root.

But you add that Leading Tone to the chord, suddenly, the Leading Tone is no longer the Leading Tone, and the entire function of the chord changes, making it heavily drive to the IV (or ii) chord and it's not a Tonic, nor stable, and so on.

Common Practice Period <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is actually sort of driven by the resolution of the 7th in sort of an underlying layer kind of way.

When you get to Jazz, things are different because a 7th chord can be a stable Tonic, so there's a different approach there - again meaning all these things are based on context rather than any black and white "system".

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think it's a generational thing (or, and I don't mean this to be mean, but an "uninformed" kind of thing). It could also be language/cultural things where a non-westerner might have a musical culture where many more things are named and expect the same of western-descended music.

With the generational thing, I think it's a result of the whole "tag" generation - the internet - where we have to have "catchwords" (Epic, Meta, Curate, etc.) for everything, and you see it with Genres in pop music - "Is this Chill, Wave, Trap, Chilltrapwave, Ambient-Electro-Disco...?"

The internet has made the world a huge - and confusing - place. That's why we're seeing such a rise in "identity" issues - the NEED to belong to some "defined" group that isn't just the entire world.

Naming things is kind of a comfort blanket - used to be, you'd be part of a small community and you could figure out how you fit in or not. Now, with a world wide community, and the possiblity of fitting in in so many ways, people are just overwhlemed - it's why we NEED people to "curate" things for us - we're just getting too much information thrown at us at one time.

This is why things like "Negative <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" can gain such a fast foothold - because it has a name (and what young person doesn't like the sound of something "negative"!).

It's why people are always asking "how do I make melancholic music" - words that no one would ever even thing to ask in that way in the past. Because they've seen it online, or in Apple's Loop Catagories (tags) in a Garageband or in some other DAW, or I'm beginning to think because they had the subtitles on on a movie - "melancholic music intensifies"...

I don't want to sound like a "these kids today" because I know that happens with every generation.

However, what I'm seeing is this much larger "generation break" where the explosion of the internet in such a relatively short time has just led to mass confusion and everyone trying to find their way.

It's turned into an obsession with naming (tagging, hashtagging, etc.) everything it seems.

It's an interesting - and little bit alarming - thing to watch unfold. But I really do seriously worry about how my kids are going to function in this kind of society (or really, lack of society).
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Well, the problem with this is, it only goes so far - Monophony is used more as a change of or relief in texture as opposed to a primary means of composing outside of certain specific intentions.

What this means is, you're more likely to have <b><u>harmony</u></b> - at least a 2nd voice in a piece of music than not.

And what that means is, it's find to develop a motive like this unaccompanied, but when you add a 2nd voice, these developments may not "work" with the 2nd voice.

Either that, or they would "dictate" the 2nd voice, which you may not want.

I would say, the next exercise you should do is pick some kind of static accompaniment idea that's not too complex or that doesn't draw too much attention to itself, and then do a melody with motivic development over it.

IOW, it's kind of "easy" to develop a motive when there's nothing else going on that might influence/impact it. But if something else is going on, the trick is to be able to work within those restrictions/limitations.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Right, you don't really generate the PROGRESSION from the scale.

You generate the CHORDS from the scale.

Then once you've created the chords, the order you put them in doesn't really have anything to do with the scale, other than usually you would still be using the chords from the scale, so the root notes would be on scale notes.

The reason we generate chords the way we do is because of long-established tradition - tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or "stacking in 3rds".

So why shouldn't chord progressions be generated the same way? Based on long-established traditions?

They're not things that exist in a vacuum.

You learn tons of songs, and you see what progressions are common, and use those when you want the same kind of vibe. "Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" is another long-established tradition. "Stock Progressions" are other types of long-standing traditions, such as forms like "the Doo Wop Progression", "12 Bar Blues", "The Andalusian Cadence" and so on. Not all progressions have names (the vast majority do not) but there are common patterns in every style. If you want to write classical sounding music, you probably won't want to use a Jazz or Metal chord progression and vice versa (unless going for a specific effect - then you'd still have to be familiar with the progressions in those styles to pull that off effectively).

You could just roll a die to generate chord progressions. But most people (everyone really) learns chord progressions from existing music, then toys with variations to come up with things they like when writing a song. Some just go with a "stock" progression and concentrate on making music and not worrying about chord progressions - evidenced by the number of 12 bar blues tunes out there.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"Triads" are 3 note chords.

There are 4, 5, etc note chords, and there are even 2 note chords, but the Triad is the primary "building block" of chords if you like - so much so that when most people say "chord" people assume a 3-note chord - a Triad.

So an F Triad will have an F, an A, and a C in it.

So yes, the F note, then a 3rd above it (every other white key), then a 3rd above that note, which is also a "5th" above the F.

For that reason we say a triad consists of:

1-3-5

or 

Root - 3rd - 5th

in this example, the Root (or 1) is F.

3 (or the 3rd) would be A, and the 5th (or 5) is a C

F-A-C

This makes an F Major Triad.

It's Major because of the distance between the F and the A, which is TWO whole steps.

It so happens that there's also measurable distances between the F and C as well as the A and C, and while we can learn what those are, and those help us to name the whole chord. This gets into intervals between those other notes which IMHO is a bit confusing and you should probably learn the Diatonic ones in a key first to have something to build from.

The reason I mention this though is, if you take "every other white key" on a keyboard, you'll notice there are a couple of places where there's no black key between two white keys - that's that E and F and B and C I was talking about before. 

So you can make a "chord" by playing 3 notes every other key from any starting note, but some of those will be Major, some will be Minor, and one will be diminished, because of where that "no black key between" spot will fall.

F-A-C is a Major chord, G-B-D (just move it all up one white key) is a Major chord, but A-C-E is a minor chord (just move all the notes up one white key again).

________


If you'd like to try to play something "using this", play an Am triad, on A-C-E. Then you can move all 3 notes down one white piano key and you'll have G-B-D, then one more to F-A-C - those 3 chords are all in the key of A Minor.

So if you play those as <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you can then put a melody above it using the notes of Am, which are A B C D E F G - all the white keys on the piano.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Let's say that, for modern pop music, it's "right", but in some University Theory courses if they're trying to teach you part-writing and all that, it would have issues.

However, that aside:

Chord 1: F-C-F - that's an "F chord" without the 3rd (A or Ab).

Chord 2: C-E-G - that's a C Major Chord. The G is the lowest sounding note so we write it C/G, which means "C Major with a G in the Bass".

Chord 3: A-C-E - that's an A Minor Chord. Am/E

Chord 4a: D-G-C - is not a "standard" triad, but a variation of one. It's called a "sus4 chord". Sometimes these chords are hard to figure out, but by going to the next chord it will make more sense:

Chord 4b: G-B-D - this is a G Major chord. G/D. You can see in this order, the B is the 3rd of the chord. If I raise it a note, it's a 4 in relation to the Root, G. So G-C-D would be 1-4-5 instead of 1-3-5 and that's what we call the "Sus4" chord. So Chord 4a above is a Gsus4/D, and chord 4b is a G/B.

You should hear that the suspended note, C, kind of "resolves into the chord" when it moves to the B note. This is a really common pattern and your ear correctly told you it "sounds right".

Chord 5: F-A-C - that's an F Major - this time it has the 3rd. Also F/C.

So you may be wondering why I "re-ordered" the notes of your chord, and why they're called "F/C" instead of just F.

The reason is, we name chords from the Root, and we need to figure out what that note is, so we can also determine the distance between 1 and 3, as well as either 1 and 5 or 3 and 5 so we can figure out what type it is. 

So whenever you get a set of 3 notes, your first step is to assume it's a Triad, and then see if you can arrange the letters to every other letter.

Your first chord we really can't.

The 2nd chord - from low to high is G-C-E - but G to C is not "every other letter". E-G-C is also not every other letter. The only order that works is C-E-G.

So that means C is the Root.

With that, we can then look at how far it is from C to E (and E to G or C to G) to figure out what kind of chord it is. C to E is TWO whole steps (C to D, then D to E) so it's a MAJOR 3rd.

We'd need to figure out the C to G or E to G too, but for the sake of simplicity right now you can play that and see it doesn't sound "diminished" (play B-D-F and see what it sounds like!) so with a Major 3rd and not sounding diminished, it's probably Major, and it is.

So it's a C Major Triad, with the notes C-E-G, but ordered so that the G is the lowest sounding note.

When that happens, we say the chord is "inverted", which simply means, one of the notes other than the Root is the lowest sounding note.

C-E-G from low to high would just be called "C" and we say it's "root position".

E-G-C from low to high would be called "C/E" and we'd say it's "First Inversion".

G-C-E from low to high is C/G and that's "Second Inversion"

So actually, all of your chords have the 5 as the lowest sounding note, so that means they're all (except the first one) in 2nd inversion.

_____

Back to the 1st chord - since there's no 3rd, we're not truly sure if it's F-A-C or F-Ab-C or even something like F-Bb-C, which would be an Fsus4.

But, usually we make assumptions based on the other notes in the piece. Since there's an A note in the 3rd chord, we can kind of safely assume that if the 1st chord had a 3rd, it would be an A instead of an Ab, so it would be F-A-C.

The duplicate F on top makes no difference - we don't count that as anything. So a Triad can have 3 DIFFERENT notes, but duplicates of any of those don't change what the chord is.

So right now the chord is 1-5-8 or 1-5-1 (8 is the octave of the lower F, but since it's the same note, we can just call it 1 if we want).

Or put another way, with the missing 3rd:

1-[3]-5-1

Most people would not call this an "F Major Chord" or more specifically, it's not an F Major *Triad*. However, it **implies** and F Major <b><u>harmony</u></b>. We do have a name for a chord that's just the 1 and 5, called a "Power Chord" (comes from rock guitar where it's used all the time) but there was never an "official" name for that. Years ago most people would call it "F(no3rd)" but now they call it "F5".

So your first chord is "F5". It's an "incomplete" triad - and F Major chord with no 3rd.

So you can see, if you try to stack F-C (and duplicate F) to get "every other letter" you really can't without inserting the "imaginary number" that represents the A in there.

Likewise, looking at chord 4a - D-G-C - you can't make that one every other letter either.

It could be lots of things, but luckily for us the answer is in the next chord - it's a "variation" of the chord that follows it - so really, the C note is a "substitute for" the B note.

So if we use the next chord, or replace the C with B, we get D-G-B from low to high, and again we have to order that so it's every other letter - which G-B-D is the only option.

So then what we do is figure out what that is, then put the C back in for the B and get G-C-D and see how that changes the chord.

Now we know (or I'm telling you in this case :-) that it's Gsus4, and then when we put it back in the order it appears in the music - with the D or 5 as the lowest sounding note, it's Gsus4/D - another 2nd inversion chord.

As for the Key, what you try to do is see if the notes you use are exclusive to any one key.

You have, from chord to chord, ignoring duplicates:

F - C - G - E - A -B - D - and that's it. You have to put them in "Alphabetical Order". Since there's an A, I can start there:

A B C D E F G - yep, there's 7 different letters, so that happens to be a Major or Minor scale.

Which one?

Well if you look at the circle of 5ths, there's only 2 keys with NO sharps or flats (there are no sharps or flats in those letters, are there?). That would be C Major or A Minor.

But which is it?

Well, Key is a little tougher to determine based on raw note data - since there will always be two "related" (called Relative) keys that share the same key signature (I mentioned that before).

You have to decide if A sounds like the "Home" note, or if C does. If it's A, then the key is A minor. If it's C, it's C Major.

Now, one catch here: not all music is Major or Minor - it can be in modes as you kind of touched on before.

Since this song only has one Am chord, and one C Major chord, it kind of could be either from that standpoint. The only chord it has more of than any other chord is the F chord (or F5 and F/C - that's more "F-ness"!).

Also, the F chords both begin and end the pattern, which could make them sound "more important" or "more musically emphasized" which can over-ride the raw note content for Major or Minor and make it a mode instead.

So it's possible that this is actually in the mode of F Lydian.

That opens a whole big can of worms.

But what I'd like to see you try is to change the B note to Bb.

If you look at the key signature for the Key of F Major on the circle of 5ths, you'll see it has 1 flat - B-flat. So this means any B note will be Bb, but all the other notes will still be the plain letters. So the only thing that's going to change here is that one note in chord 4b.

That would make it more definitively in the key of F Major, rather than making this F Lydian sounding - which Lydian can be kind of ambiguous.

To see the difference, follow your chord 4a and 4b with a C chord and I bet it's going to really sound strongly like C Major.

This may be confusing, but it's to our advantage as composers because we can screw with people's expectations and have fun with our listeners!

But like I said, for a beginner, it's probably best to get your Major and Minor keys down first, before messing with modes because they can be very confusing (and unfortunately there's a lot of confusing information out there on the web about them too).

Try an experiment - do kind of the same thing you did here, start and end with F, but if you use any chord with a B note in it, make it Bb, and that will put you more solidly in F Major.

And that would be an example of using theory - knowing what the notes in F Major are - in a practical way - to write a progression in F Major  - intentionally!

Because you may not have intended to write in Lydian (or C Major or A Minor for that matter since you didn't start or end with either of those chords) and just "eared it out". Nothing ever wrong with that - your ear should always be the final decider! But, if you start off trying to write in F Major, and start and end on an F chord, and use only the notes of an F Major scale you got from the circle of 5ths, usuing chords you build from every other note of the F scale, and putting them in Root Position, 1st Inversion, or 2nd Inversion (1, 3, or 5 as the lowest note respectively), you can suddenly have a lot of control over how the progression sounds and make the "F-ness" really come to the fore - if you want.

I'd say he's not really "using a scale" per se

Instead, he's playing the arpeggio notes of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and embellishing it with chromatic tones.

Or, at least, that's how it would have been analyzed (and still is) before the advent of "altered scale" kind of thinking.

I'd hesitate to say Chopin used a diminished scale either - it's more likely chromatic embellishing tones to a o7 chord that happen to create a set of notes we now see within diminished scales, but that's not really how composers of this era were conceptualizing the music.

There was a shift in thinking at some point to a "scale based" approach rather than a "<b><u>harmony</u></b> based" approach and the two get mixed up in weird ways.

It drives me crazy when someone says "the Whole Tone scale is derived from two Augmented Triads a step apart".

Um, no, it's a scale formed by major 2nds and that's it. That you can derive two augmented triads is just happenstance.

So I think the same applies here - maybe if it were Scriabin, who started "using scales" more like you're talking about, I could see it, but Chopin - well, maybe he's on the verge of it, but I still think it's largely harmonically based and it's about embellishments to chord tones, not a "scale" per se.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; But very unusual embellishments on a very unusual <b><u>harmony</u></b>! 

That is true.

Chopin is very interesting. In some ways, I think Chopin was "unschooled" or "primitive" - he was sort of "outside" of the core of European composition - in Poland, and he also never really seemed to forget those Polish influences like in the Mazurkas, which I'm sure also included his influences from Folk music.

So I think he did a lot of things that other composers at the same time didn't, and of course that did influence later composers.

For example, when he uses a Neapolitan, it's in Root Position, and it's almost like no one told him, "you can't use that in Root Position, it should be in First Inversion" - and it's not like many other composers who did things "wrong" to spite tradition - I think he just didn't know tradition as well as others - almost like a pop guy trying to write what he thought was classical music (and maybe why so many pop guys gravitate towards his style even today). That's an exaggeration of course, but I do think Chopin was sort of pushing the boundaries - by in some ways not knowing what all the boundaries were.

I'm reminded of some of the places where he has a quartal stack and someone shouts out "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" and I'm like, I don't think so, but, what Chopin was doing was preparing us sonically for these less traditional sounds so that when other composers came along and did kind of take a more "technical" approach to it, the groundword (or soundwork as it were) had been laid.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In Classical music, or music of the Common Practice Period (which includes the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods) EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF MUSIC MODULATES!!!!

OK, 99.9% of all pieces modulate. It's extremely extremely rare for a CPP not to modulate. Those that don't tend not to do so for rather specific reasons, like they might be just an Exercise, or something that's a smaller form that has other musical purposes, like an Etude, or Prelude.

Other exceptions are some types of pieces that may "touch on" other key areas which are more than just a simple tonicization, but maybe not quite a full-fledged modulation.

Most pieces will AT LEAST start in one home key, and then modulate to another, and then back to the home key again.

Many will go through multiple keys.

_____

Pre CPP music is not tonal, and the concept of "key" is not really appropriate, but pieces of the Renaissance will change mode, and there's sort of a parallel concept to "modulating" - focusing on different modes or Finals of different modes etc.

_____

Long before that, we have just monophonic modal pieces and these tend to stay in one "pitch area" the whole time - one single mode. They might focus on different scale degrees, which could be seen as a precursor to modulation, but not really the same idea (though, when these chants were later harmonized in the CPP, they did often treat these as modulations).

That goes along with Folk melodies, which remained Modal and often, unaccompanied, for a very long time.

When those kinds of melodies were harmonized in the CPP, they too would be "tonalized" and contain modulations, but the original Folk Song would not have originally modulated - and early settings with <b><u>harmony</u></b> may not.

There are numbers of "drone" pieces where drone notes imply (to later ears) a certain <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but as those are the only notes available in the tuning, it always stays in that "key".

You can see this in the number of Folk Instruments that are Diatonic - Fife, Recorder, Applachian (Mountain) Dulcimer, Diatonic Harp, and so on. Those earlier versions of instruments were designed to play in a single key only (though various modes) outside of instruments that allowed some half-hole accidentals and so on. Even a modern pedal harp is tuned to a single key, and to change keys in the piece, pedals have to be used to re-tune it on the fly. So that comes from that heritage.

So does the original concept of French Horns - horns originally had no valves and were limited in notes they could play - which was OK before the CPP when changing keys weren't required. During the CPP, before Valves, you had to change crooks, and before that, they just used two horns - one in C and one in G for example, to get the notes from each key (it's more involved than that but that's an overview).

_____

In modern popular music, it's actually **comparatively** rare to modulate. Many songs never do anything but stay in the same key or mode.

Also, many people (trained) use the word "modulate" slightly differently than "key change".

When a modern pop tune just moves up a step in the repeating chorus at the end, we call that a "key change" usually - most of the time because it involves an actual key signature change in the music, and it's abrupt.

While officially it's still a modulation, we tend to use modulation for "smoother" changes in key, and those that aren't necessarily just "the same music transposed".

____

Some people also don't know about Tonicization and don't understand that many of the things they call Modulations are not really modulations. But in Jazz, because an improviser will be looking at the key a pair of chord might imply so they have a note set for improvising, they'll say "these two chords are in this key" when really, they're not a "true" modulation, but a Tonicization. Happens in pop music too when just a single chord is out of key.

In formal academic theory, a Modulation is "hinted at, then confirmed, then continues in the new key" in its most typical form. That is, you get some chords from another key. But if there's no cadence, then it's not confirmed. If it cadences in the new key, then that's confirmation, but typically, the music will also continue in the new key (ignoring repeats).

______

IMHO, some kind of terminology needs to exist for pop songs that move from Major to the Relative Minor or vice versa.

So many songs in G will "move to" Em for a verse or chorus. Sometimes, these seem like modulations, but they're often more like pre-CPP modality, where it's just a "focus" on the relative key. Traditionally, modulating to a relative key is truly modulating, but in the modern pop sense there's more often a "duality" between the two keys, often to the point where we're not really sure which of the two keys is the "primary" one - they alternate in quick succession, neither is more prominent than the other, and so on.

_____

As a general rule, you can simply say that, more modulations are less common.

There are probably more songs out there now with 0 modulations, and then probably 80% that number with 1 modulation, then maybe, because of CPP music, if we count modulation as strictly one key to another, including back to a previous one (so 2) then there may be a really high percentage that do 2 modulations (but only 2 total keys). 3 modulations would be rarer, 4 rarer than that, and so on.

Same with keys since I brought that up - a piece in 1 key pretty common, in 2 keys nowhere near. In 3 different keys, rarer still.

So, if a song is going to modulate, it's probably going to be only once at most.

However, it is possible that a song could have a modulation built into a section, and that section repeat a number of times, so in a pop tune there could be 1 modulation, but it repeated a number of times, and thus raise the number if you want to count the totals.

but as a general rule, moving to more than 3 different keys in a piece would be fairly rare comparatively speaking.

FWIW, some types of pieces - those that are more experimental, or Romantic Period music which became more modulatory by nature, or forms like Opera or Ballet, where multiple scenes might be considered one "piece" will of course modulate more.

A simple Minuet might modulate twice (original to other key, then back) but a Fantasia by nature might go through a number of keys.

And the development sections of Classical and especially Romantic pieces could "touch on" a number of keys, but not all of those are necessarily full-fledged modulations. Those sections alone, if counted, would drastically increase the number of modulations and number of different keys modulated to in the Classical Period alone.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes, you need to understand <b><u>harmony</u></b> first.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Kansas: Carry on Wayward Son

The Organ, Piano, and Guitar parts are all largely playable, though the Organ solo is pretty difficult for non-keyboard specialists, but worthy of study nonetheless.

The guitar solos aren't horrible, but won't tell you too much about the compositional merits nor do they really affect the analysis all that much.

However, the song is an excellent example of how various sections can be knit together. There are minor and major 7th chords in addition to the standard triads, there are modulations, there are tempo changes, there are "pure rock" lines alongside "faux classical" piano and "blues organ" licks, in addition to standard Minor scales and pentatonic/blues scales and riffs. There's pure Minor, there's Dorian. There are a couple of meter changes, and interesting uses of triplets versus quarters and then quarter note triplets (or at least what sounds like those because of the meter shift).

The fairly correct Piano and Organ parts as well as guitar tabs can be found online pretty easily, and I know there's a published Piano Book that has the piano and organ (not 100% accurate but pretty darn close) ans probably video lessons on both (in fact, I know there are video lessons on the organ solo because I had to look them up when I learned the song).

This is a great song because it's FULL of all kinds of stuff you won't necessarily find in any single other song that is as "iconic" (outside of something like Bohemian Rhapsody, which I'd recommend too, but can be a little more challenging to play) and pretty playable even for an intermediate player. I learned the main rhythm guitar stuff when I was pretty much a beginner - so did my son when I taught it to him.  I'm not a great keyboard player but am able to handle all the keyboard parts in the song save for the organ solo, which I have to fake some portions of. I've never learned all the solos on guitar, but they're not too terribly difficult if you're already familiar with basic pentatonic playing. If not, they'd make good jumping off points. The middle section one is tricky rhythmically, but the real neat part is what's going on in the background there anyway.

Another interesting point is the <b><u>harmony</u></b> vocals, which you wouldn't play on your instrument playing the song in a cover band for example, but, they're worth analysis too because there's something a little funky going on with them as compared to the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

I can't think of any other song that packs so much in that still is fairly well known and still played regularly on rock radio - that's also technically accomplishable on both keys and guitar.

The Beatles examples are always good, but often the Guitar is not at the fore, or the piano isn't (or other keys) and while harmonically and structurally (and melodically) interesting (and even sublime), they can be harder to play in that there's nothing to play, or what you play isn't really a significant enough part on it's own that will really "gel" with the theoretical aspects. Beach Boys vocal harmonies are always fascinating, but for playing, the guitar and piano parts are often more "parts of the whole" then significant things again (sort of the same issue with Queen a lot of times).

Carry on Wayward Sons has those really obvious parts that makes it easy for your ear to grab on to and playing any of them sounds "like you're playing the song".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>First of all, you need a MODEL - an existing piece, or number of pieces that you can model your piece after.

I would say, you could to a Piano piece, or a Piano and Violin duet as the easiest things.

I agree about FORM - however, I might suggest a simple 3 part form that goes A - B - A - some music, some varied music, then a repeat of the original music.

It's a pretty basic formula (Ternary Form) without getting into all the intricacies of Rounded Binary and other, more complex forms.

A Simple Binary (A B) form could be good too, but most of us like that feeling of "coming back" to the A section material, so all you do is tack on the opening A section at the end after the B.

You might try a simple Waltz, in "melody with accompaniment" style.

Here is an EXCELLENT type of piece to try to write:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aspcdJ8Nz0c

The melody doesn't have to have all the chromatic notes, nor the fancy triplets or quintuplets and all the little trills and other ornaments, but notice how the Left Hand simply does the same basic pattern throughout, with only a change at the end of a phrase.

One of the big problems a lot of new composers run into is they try to throw everything they can think of into a single piece, and that's not really how music is written.

Here we have a simple A Minor melody in the RH (it never even plays and chords really) and a simple very repetitive accompaniment in the LH (always the same basic pattern that just goes through the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - and that's because the real interest is in the melody).

The form here is pretty obvious - 8 measure phrase (could be 4 measure sub-phrases as there is a "mid point" in the melody). It's repeated (on page 2). This would be your A section.

Then there's a new section - your B section - another 8 bars repeated (this time with repeat bars) where the melody is a little "busier" (though the LH still pretty much remains the same). Then the A section returns.

You could just end there, or with a repeated A, and have a nice "little piece" in A B A form.

That's all it really takes, and all you should really try to accomplish.

If you'd like to make it for Piano and Violin, you could just break up the Piano into Bass Note LH, and chords RH - which would be appropriate for Children to play, and then give the Violin the Melody.

For a little more advanced piece, you could maybe have the Violin do Pizzicato notes on the down beat, or as the beat 2 and 3 chords (and it could even play double stops if you wanted to get slightly more advanced) while the RH piano does the melody.

You could have the Violin play the melody and the piano go accompaniment as before, or you could trade them off section by section. That adds a little more interest without the music getting any more difficult to play.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not sure what you mean "improvise over the track".

Ordinarily, something you'd improvise over, you don't use chords. You use single notes.

The chords, or implied <b><u>harmony</u></b> is usually present in the track.

If it was just a drum beat, yeah, sure you can put in whatever chords you want.

But if you've got a backing track that has it's own chord progression, you really shouldn't be "improvising chords" over that track.

It is possible to play chordal stuff, or harmonized lines, or chords that create extensions of the chords that are already there, but that's not what we usually do when we "improvise" except in certain specific situations - and even in those it involves knowing what the existing chord progression is.

If the chords are already there, you shouldn't be "adding a major or minor chord" to it.

It is possible, if a D Minor chord were playing, and you "improvised" an F chord over it, it might sound like not much has changed - because it hasn't  - all you did was add a C note, which makes it Dm7 - not a huge difference in sound.

But if you add an Eb chord over a D chord, it's probably going to sound like crap.

So not sure what you're actually doing, but if you have a loop with chords that go Dm7 - G7 - Am7 - Dm7, then you should be playing single note lines over that - melodies (ideally) that conform to the notes (scale, key, mode) given by those chords (it would be D Dorian in that example).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you play a chord progression like Am - G - F - G and repeat, that's in A minor.

You would play A Minor Pentatonic over it.

If the progression were C - Em - F - C, that's C Major, you'd play C Major Pentatonic over it.

If you try to play A Minor Pentatonic over the C chord progression it's just going to sound like C Major Pentatonic because the <b><u>harmony</u></b> kind of "wins out".

And this is because of what you already know - they're the same scale basically.

But what makes the two different - besides how the chord progression will make them seem, is musical emphasis.

While you shouldn't really just run up and down the scale, you should focus on the notes that make the scale what it is by playing, say, C on the down beat, as opposed to A on the downbeat. Melodic lines should resolve to C in C, and A in Am.

So it's not really what you play (the "pattern" that is either scale) but HOW you play it - which notes you play when, and how you emphasize them.

Another way to look at this is, if you were going to solo over Brown-Eyed Girl (or rather, if you had the unfortunate luck to have to :-) the song is in G Major, so you'd use G Major Pentatonic - and even though it's the same shape as Em, you'd want to be *thinking* G - and focusing on the elements of the scale that give it more "G-ness".

But if you were playing over Blood and Roses by The Smithereens, which is in E minor (it's tuned down a half step though) you'd want to use Em pentatonic - same scale again, but it's about the emphasis.

For example, that typical Chuck Berry lick where you bend the 3rd string up and then hit the B and E strings on the same fret (say 12th) is going to be very "E" sounding, and playing that over the G Major progression isn't going to sound quite right. 

So it's about how you focus the notes - and you learn this from learning solos of others.

As A-5-Star-Man mentions, you can also use them in other ways but probably the most common thin in pop/rock is to use the in a bluesy fashion, which is actually kind of counter-intuitive - you'd use A Minor Pentatonic over a Blue in A - which is A "major". So you play a minor pentatonic over an otherwise major progression. And this is what gives you your "blue notes".

The absolute best thing you can do is start learning solos and start identifying what scale they use, and if they're pentatonic, see how they use them.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>As soon as you say IIIm is a resting chord, you're not talking about Classical Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> anymore, and as Vornska says, Function really only has meaning in a specific style.

In Classical music, a minor v would not function as a dominant.

However, in other styles of music it could "behave like" a dominant, or "assume the role of" the dominant.

The Classical functions are:

I Tonic.

ii Subdominant (or I prefer, pre-Dominant)

iii Mediant/variable

IV Subdominant

V Dominant

vi Mediant/Variable

viio Dominant

and in minor

i Tonic

iio Subdominant

III (bIII) Mediant/variable

iv Subdominant

v no traditional function

V Dominant

VI (bVI) Mediant/Variable

bVII no traditional function

viio Dominant

Some of these functions are carried over into other styles, some of them are expanded in other styles, and some are modified.

Also, it needs to be understood that not every I chord has a Tonic function at a given time nor is every V chord a dominant function.

Functions are more like roles that some chords are commonly called on to play, at certain times.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>ONe thing that can help is, to try to do things you do well.

For example, WRT to who sings which <b><u>harmony</u></b>, well, you need to find out each person's range and who's comfortable on which part or if you've got someone who's not a strong harmonizer, you need to let them sing the part they can find really easily.

Last night, at one of the few rehearsals we have (new bass player) the other guitarist was singing 3 part with the other vocalists and I mentioned the note and he was like "I really HEAR that part and gravitate towards it, so it's easy for me to do" which was great, because the two ladies heard the higher and lower parts really easily - so everyone is on their best part on that song.

We did another song though where they were fumbling around and we had to switch who sang the lead - bam, problem solved. So sometimes it takes a little effort, but the results can be worth the effort.

Which songs to do is more tricky - you want material first and foremost that you can do well and that's fun for you to do -because then you'll be more into it.

Don't try to play extremely difficult songs you just can't do unless there's really some over-riding reason to do them. Instead, concentrate on "accomplishable" music - and that too goes along with experience - I meet people in bands all the time who work on songs for months before someone finally says, "I don't think this is a good song for us".

I coulda told them that on the first day ;-)

Luckily there a bazillions of songs out there, so you have plenty from which to choose - just don't burn too much time trying to learn something you can't get. If everyone is doing their homework, but the song is not coming together after 2 rehearsals, it's time to really investigate why it's not coming together, and if you can fix it, fix it, if not, axe it. There are more fish in the sea!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Before you do anything else, you need to get people to actually sing it so you can hear it and get feedback from them.

For that purpose, you may need an instrument that gives the notes/<b><u>harmony</u></b> so they can find their parts. Many choral scores that are a capella have a piano part included "for rehearsal only".

But you really need to hear this with singers who can do justice to it.
Then you can decide if you want to add additional instruments.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>All of the above! Maybe the most "versatile" chord in the lexicon.

Fully diminished 7th chords (o7 hereafter) can in fact be functional. They are a Dominant Function chord. They naturally appear in Minor Keys when using harmonic minor on scale degree raised 7 - a Bo7 in the key of C Minor for example.

They can also be borrowed into the parallel major for the same purpose (the diatonic chord is a half-diminished 7, but borrowing the o7 from the parallel minor is common in its place).

Because of this, it can also be used as a Secondary Leading Tone chord - like F#o7 as vii^o7 /V  in the key of C Major.

However, o7 chords are also found in other roles such as a "Common Tone o7 Chord" or other linear and embellishing type chords, especially in other styles where they can be used just for their sound.

_______

Since o7 chords are symmetrical, they take part in a special kind of modulation called an Enharmonic Modulation. C#o7 is "the same chord" as Eo7. If they were both to resolve functionally to their own Tonic, C# would move to D, and E would move to F. However, they're spelled differently - C#-E-G-Bb versus E-G-Bb-Db. In a o7, the 7th would resolve down and the root (being the leading tone) would resolve up - so if you're in Dm, and you have C#-E-G-Bb it "should" resolve to something with D-A in it - i or Dm of course.

But, if you "enharmonically refigure" the C# as a Db, it becomes the 7th of E-G-Bb-Db and would resolve down to C, while the root, E, would resolve up to F, leading you to some form of F chord (ignore the fact it's in 2nd inversion for now as your starting chord need not be in root position).

Even if the chord is not re-spelled with the Db, if it resolves that way, we consider it to have behaved as if it were an Enharmonic Equivalent.

Now, C#-E-G-Bb can be E-G-Bb-Db, or G-Bb-Db-Fb, or Bb-Db-Fb-Abb even. So each one can resolve differently.

Therefore, any o7 chord can resolve as a viio7/? FOUR ways - basically to a chord whose root is a half step above one of the notes of the chord.

____

I think you made a typo, but yes, moving from G7 to Bo7/Ab happens. Very often the Root of a V7 moves up a half step, or, the 7th of the o7 moves down a half step to form the V7 chord.

This again could happen within an Enharmonic context - Bo7 has it's D move up to Db, making it Db-F-Ab-B - either a Db7 that could resolve to Gb, or a Db+6 that could resolve to C (as C, or as V of the key of F, etc.).

But it happens in the primary key as well and remains there. Many such moves may just be some neighbor motion within the "Dominant <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" but it helps to point out why these are so closely related and why some authors like Piston consider a o7 as a "Rootless V7b9" - because they behave very similarly.

_____

There are other ways o7 chords can arise - through voice-leading, embellishments and other linear motion, as well as what we might call "apparent" o7 chords that are the result of some happenstance simultaneous sounding of pitches that happen to form a o7 chord, but it doesn't operate functionally or as any kind of o7 chord we really know.

____

Yes, they are just used for sound as well. The old cliche about the silent films with the lady tied to the railroad track - you'll always hear the o7 chord played along with that to create a sense of tension!

Sometimes they'll just stream them up or down in parallel motion for effect.

Half diminished seventh chords (%7 hereafter) work similarly with a couple of exceptions:

The %7 is found natively in only 2 places - on 7 in MAJOR keys, and on ii in Minor.

Traditionally, this means Leading Tone %7 chords can only resolve to Major chords - so, for example, in the key of C Major, you wouldn't have a vii%7/iii because Em doesn't have it's own %7.

This means an F#%7 could only resolve to a G chord, not a Gm chord.

And because it's not symmetrical, it can't resolve 4 ways enharmonically.

However, a D%7 in Cm would usually go to V or G. So, if it were a Secondary Leading Tone %7 chord it would go to Eb - so think of that like a "Deceptive move".

So D%7 can go to Eb or G (which are both in Cm, but it's not a Secondary resolution like the o7, only one is - the other is Pre-Dominant to Dominant)

But this means it can be used as a pivot chord. So if you were in Gm, your ii%7 could just go to D, or it could act like vii%7/III and lead to Bb.

They too can be used just for sound as well as in parallel runs and things like that, and can also arise from voice leading (the ivadd6 being a common variation).

They were a favorite among Romantic/20the Century composers, especially French Impressionists because of their relationship to the Dominant 9th chord - they, like the o7, form a "Rootless" relation with the Dominant Chord. B%7 is the upper notes of G9 - so a "rootless dominant 9th chord".

Also, intervalically speaking, it is an inversion of the Dominant 7th chord (see, Negative <b><u>Harmony</u></b> existed way before Jacob Collier) and there was interest in that.

_____

In Jazz, things get a little trickier - the m7b5 chord (%7) is often used as much for its sound as a "connector" in voice-leading moves.

Any minor 6 chord - like Cm6 - is also an inverted %7. That common ivadd6 (like Fm6 in C) is a common variation of the Plagal Cadence (sometimes called the Hollywood Cadence) which arises through voice-leading and isn't a "true" %7 chord, but it exhibits some of the properties of it. It's like part IV, and part V, all rolled into one.

That's a lot to digest, so I would recommend if you're totally unfamiliar with them to begin with, starting with your basic Secondary Dominant (Secondary Leading Tone) versions of viio7 and work with them until you have them solid.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Traditionally, in CPP music, when you add a dissonance to a chord, it sort of "puts it in a position of forcing it to resolve".

In that style of music, chordal 7ths basically must resolve down by step.

If your target is a Tonic chord, then you need a note that's going to lead to C, E, or G as a 7th.

That would be D, F, or A.

Additionally, it's nice to have the Leading Tone in the chord as well (B).

And of those choices, F not only would be a 7th above G, but it ALSO forms a dissonant interval with the Leading Tone, which itself wants to resolve up to the tonic, so not only does it want to resolve down to the 3rd of the Tonic chord just because it's a 7th, but it's given even more "need to resolve" by being part of a dissonant interval that, contrapuntally speaking, needs to "collapse".

(side note: there's a history of how the V7-I cadence evolved and in earlier counterpoint it was the motion within a vii^o6 chord - which if you add the G below, becomes the V7, so it's not "all" about the 7th but as the <b><u>harmony</u></b> evolved that became an important aspect).

So adding the 7th, F, to the V chord, G, gives the G a lot more "need to resolve" or "forward push" than just having the Leading Tone alone.

Notice that B-D-F-A takes that a step further, and some would say is an even more dissonant chord and demands resolution even more strongly, and B-D-F-Ab even more so, but composers also wanted this Root movement of a 4th up and maybe a little more stable <b><u>harmony</u></b> in many places - which is why E-G-B-D didn't really become "the" Dominant or another chord with dominant function like V(7) and viio(7) did.

I would agree with your "often" rather than "always". There are certainly plenty of instances of V chord without the 7th. But I suppose we could say in a real general way, when a composer wanted a little extra added "oomph" adding the 7th to the V would get that for them, and because it's the only one of its kind in a Key (the other 7th chords are M7 and m7 aside from the other dominant, the %7 or o7 and excluding the bVII7 in minor which has a different function) it sort of becomes the "most important" if not most common one.

Obviously, as we moved forward in time, into the 20th century and into Jazz, 7ths no longer necessarily had this need to resolve down - they were still used that way in some contexts but they were also used just for sound. So we can say that now, they're often added to any chord either just for sound or for the added tension and thus need to resolve, but in older music it was sort of all about adding that dissonance that needed to resolve.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Maybe I'm misunderstanding your original post or goals here.

This is, a "melody", or a "line", or we might also call it a "lick" or potentially a "riff".

However, that's all it is.

How did you come up with this idea - I mean, how did you conceive of it - did you have a <b><u>harmony</u></b> in mind when you made it, what scale or key is it in, why does it sound the way it sounds (other than, betcha can't play it as a possible goal)?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, the first example, you say you wanted to add <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but didn't know how.

That's kind of the issue I'm trying to get at (if that is the issue).

Usually a line like this is conceived after the <b><u>harmony</u></b> or at least with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> in mind if it's supposed to ultimately "go with" a <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Do you know the chord progression for Mr. Crowley?

If you know the Solo, do you know how it fits with the chords?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Just FWIW, there's a difference between Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and Quartal Voicing.

Most of what you're going to find online is about Quartal *Voicing* because Jazz.

But what it is is a voicing of a chord in 4ths (or primarily 4ths) rather than 3rds, but still coming out of Tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> as a foundation for building harmonies. So in that context, naming them with familiar tertian names makes sense. C-F-Bb-Eb *is* in fact a Cm11 that just happens to be voiced in 4ths instead of 3rds, or 6ths or any other possible interval.

True Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is a different beast and we don't have names for those chords.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not really because there are infinite ways.

What you need to learn are TYPES of modulations.

1. Direct Modulation. You just go to the new key, bam. Sounds unceremonious, but it's used all the time.

2. Common Chord Modulation. You use a chord that's common to both keys as a "pivot" between them. The problem here is that Db Major and C Major don't have any chords in common between them so you have to use something like a Borrowed chord in C Major, such as bVI, and that chord (Ab) happens to be in Db as well.

3. Enharmonic Modulation. This is a special type of common chord modulation where a chord in one key is "reinterpreted enharmonically" in the new key. An example here would be a very typical way to get between these two keys actually, which is Ger+6 in the key of C (Ab-C-Eb-F#) that instead of resolving to V as it usually does, would resolve as Ab7 (V7/bII) and go to Db instead.

4. Sequential Modulation. This is a special type of direct modulation where you have a pattern and then just move it up a number of steps "sequentially". Sometimes in sequential progressions the sequences overlap making what could be considered common chords, but other times, taken on their own, they are more like direct modulations. C - F - Bb - Eb - Ab - Db could get you to Db. C-F is a pattern (up a 4th) that is treated sequentially and repeated down a step each time (Bb to Eb, then Ab to Db).

5. Common Tone Modulation. This is common with remote keys that don't share many or any chords, but might share some notes. For example, C and Db both have the note C, and the note F in them. Most Common Tone Modulations will have a chord, then single out the note - say F - and then do something with that note like maybe repeat a couple of times - and then it becomes part of a new chord in the new key.

6. Melodic Modulation. This is where the <b><u>harmony</u></b> drops out and a single melody line introduces new notes over time to imply the new key. This could be done sequentially with just the melody, or with notes that might imply a direct or common chord modulation had chords been present, but it just does it on its own.


So there are so many ways to modulate and then with each one it's a TECHNIQUE you have to learn to do. That's probably why Direct Modulations are so common in popular music because they're the easiest and not much technique is involved.

But something a lot of people don't understand is that a modulation is not going from Chord X to Chord Y but KEY X to KEY Y.

This means to get from C to Db, you don't have to go from a C Chord to a Db chord. You can use other chords - for example, if you were using a common tone modulation with the note F, it could be between an F chord, and then a Bbm chord (which would have a V-i relationship in Bbm). This could also work as a secondary common chord modulation where F acts as IV in C, and then V/vi in Db - so again, there's another way to modulate using the same chords, neither of which are the Tonic chord in either key.

What you really should do is what's best for the piece.

But if you really want to learn modulations, you have to learn to play music that modulates and tear it apart and see how it works.

Another caveat - a lot of times people don't really need to modulate in the first place so that's something to consider as a possibility as well.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The "rules" in music could be presented as "things that are always done; things that are commonly done; things that are rarely done; and things that are never done".

And that varies from style to style. The "rules" for Classical Music are different than the rules for Jazz, or Popular music.  

I'd consider what you're calling "deconstructing" basically "analysis", though Music Theory analysis usually goes deeper than just "naming chords" and also focuses more on stylistic peculiarities. For example, in Jazz, one of the main things is improvising over a chord progression. That's not something we really worry too much about in Classical music (comparatively speaking). Likewise, in Classical music, Part-Writing is very important, but in Pop music, it's virtually a non-issue (again, comparatively speaking).

So on one level, it's kind of useless to learn "Classical Theory" to see how Pop Music breaks those rules. It's kind of different styles. It's like French Cuisine versus Asian Cuisine. They share similarities of course but if you're cooking cuisine that uses very little - say, dairy - you don't really have to worry about the rules that go into making a Bechamel Sauce. It's jut not really applicable.

So the "rules" you see online all the time are mostly derived from (or are) Common Practice Period music rules (that's music of roughly 1650 to 1850) and Pop by its very nature deviates from them. It does have some similarities (it uses notes, chords, some functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, etc.) but it also has a lot of differences - which we could say are all rules that have been broken.

But with Rock (and Roll) especially, there's a "rebellious" aspect to that style that means people intentionally broke the rules - so a lot of that music doesn't even really have all that much to do with CPP Theory.

So honestly, I think unless you truly want to learn about CPP style, learning it would be kind of a waste of time.

Instead, deconstructing popular music (or the music you like) and learning **ITS** rules is more important.

Granted, learning CPP theory will give you more terminology you can use with what you analyze in popular music.

But really, just sitting down and learning tons of songs and analyzing them, you will begin to sense what is common, or not common, and those my friend, are "the rules".

And when writing, you can choose either or both paths. Some songs are best served by just "doing what is expected" and others by not. I think obviously some people want to be rebellious and "break the rules" (which granted, isn't as effective if you don't know what the rules are in the first place ;-) but there's a lot of people out there who think they're really doing something by using a minor iv in a piece in Major because it "breaks the rules" of CPP music - but it's so common in pop now that it's actually not anything new or even "edgy". So in that respect that knowledge is useful, but you don't really "need" it to learn the rules of a different style.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>From Aristoxenus (335 BC ish):

&gt;Whatever be the genus, from whatever note one starts, if
the melody moves in continuous progression either upwards
or downwards, the fourth note in order from any note must
form with it the concord [symphonon] of the fourth, or the
fifth note in order from it the concord of the Fifth. Any note
that answers neither of these tests must be regarded as out
of tune [&amp;ynphonoi] in relation to those notes with which
it fails to form the above-mentioned concords.

What people need to understand is, the concept of consonance and dissonance **pre-date** <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. The words (and the concepts) were applied first to MELODY, not <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It's in the name of the interval - "Tritone" - Tritonus - 3 tones (in a row).

u/Scatcycle noticed it too: 

&gt;He also never touched on the fact that this was always about a melodic tritone, not harmonic.

Now, "banned" is a little too colloquial of course. It wasn't "banned" so to speak  - it was considered a dissonance. And dissonances were avoided or corrected - this can be seen in the "Dasian Scale" that shows note alterations added to avoid the tritone.

Composers didn't use Dissonances. So in that sense they were "banned" (which is obviously a word that has been chosen for impact more than meaning - it's basically click bait pre-click bait).

And while a tritone might be encountered, they were always handled in specific ways. It wasn't really about "not using them", but "only using them if they were handled carefully" and that actually continues when we get into polyphony. Once dissonances are allowed they can be used as dissonances just like any other.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, if you're interested in Classical music theory and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, Seth Monahan's you tube series is the best out there.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The "five" chord in a Key resolves to the "one" chord in the Key because of centuries of evolution.

A is the "five", or "V" chord in the Key of D Major, and D Minor. D or Dm would be the I or i chord respectively in those keys.

It started because composers wanted to end pieces in D on D.

When they started writing <b><u>harmony</u></b> around the year 1,000 AD, they liked approaching the D with one note above, and one note below, so C and E would "collapse" to D, or E and C would "expand" to octave D notes.

When composers added more voices, they added the note G and at some point started altering the C to C#.

This makes what basically looks like a C#^o /E resolving to either Dm or D Major (in the olden days it wasn't always a triad, that evolves over time too).

Ultimately, they started adding the note A in the bass (it actually started in a middle voice) and had it leap to the D note.

This makes what we call an A7 chord moving to a D or Dm chord.

This became "the" common resolution for the ending of all pieces (and sections, and phrases within pieces to large extent)  and you've now heard it billions of times and have come to expect it.

When you hear A move to Dm, your brain is going to orient it as the familiar V - i pattern and accept is as "sounding resolved" because that's what it's used to. Also works (even more so) with V7 - i as well as V-I and V7-I, and even other forms of V like V9 or V7b9.

So it had originally to do with stepwise motion leading to the D from above and below. As time went on, it also came to include stepwise motion to the F (or F#) and A notes in the Dm (D) chord as well. The extra D is then approached by jump from the A when the chords are in root position.

Composers also felt that using not only stepwise motion was the best, but also that making those Semitones or Half Steps was even more effective.

So actually, in Dm, using the C that would be in the key was a step, but making it a C# turns it into the "leading tone" which is a half step to the D. This happens naturally in major keys but the note had to be altered to do so in Minor Keys (which comes from what I said up above).

One thing that's happened over time is more notes have been added that resolve to the D chord's notes by step, and then later, half step. If a V7b9 resolves to I in the key of D Major, the C# goes to D, the Bb goes to A, and the G goes to F# - that's all Half Steps! - then the E goes to D (whole step) and we still get the roots going up a 4th (or down a 5th) from A to D.

Also, while A resolves nicely to D or Dm, it's also common to add a 7th to the V chord to make A7 - because not only does that add another note that can resolve to a tone in the D chord, but it adds a DISSONANCE that want's to resolve, and it produces a dissonance within the chord that wants to resolve as well.

And these sounds have been used so much you just come to expect them to the point if they don't happen it sounds odd or surprising.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's because in traditional music (not Jazz) "Melodic Minor" is NOT a "scale". It's a **CONCEPT**.

Both Harmonic and Melodic Minor are not "true scales" that composers used "as scales" but instead they are teaching tools or mnemonic devices to show how and WHY scale degrees 6 and 7 were varied in Minor **Keys**.

In a traditional Minor Key, scale degrees 6 and 7 are variable. They are changed depending on the need. 7 is raised for a "harmonic purpose". And 6 and 7 are raised for a "melodic purpose".

7 is raised in DOMINANT FUNCTION **harmonies** so they have a Leading Tone instead of the Subtonic. In the key of C Minor this would make the "natural form" Bb into B-natural.

If you raise 7, but try to lead to it from 6 in a **melody**, there will the the awkward leap of an +2 from b6 to raised 7. So their solution was to raise 6 also whenever it was passing on to raised 7. But, when 7 is not raised (which it needn't be if there's no harmonic reason to do so) then 6 doesn't' need to be raised either. This usually happens in DESCENDING melodic movement.


In ACTUAL MUSIC, you can see this happen all the time.

here is very simple and clear example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdySQD7xFNc

You can see that the melody, when it arrives at the first D#, is over a B note to produce a dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

In the 2nd measure, a D# is also desired over the F# as both lead outward to the tonic E in dominant function fashion. Therefore the C must be raised to C# as well.

However, when going DOWN in the very same measure, you get D NATURAL and C Natural (ok, admittedly these could be acting like a D7/F# leading to the G in the next measure and be a secondary dominant but there are other situations like this where that's not even a likelihood).

Bach did not write in "E Melodic Minor" or "E Harmonic Minor".

This piece is in "E Minor" Period. Music like this doesn't "use scales". Instead it uses a **KEY**. And Minor keys have two variable scale degrees, 6, and 7, which are changed for Melodic or Harmonic reasons, though they can appear unchanged as well.

So to the uninitiated, this looks like it's "Harmonic Minor in measure 1" and "Melodic Minor in measure 2". But that's an oversimplification. It's just E Minor, and the C and D are changed as necessary for harmonic or melodic purposes.

So you can think of the Melodic Minor and Harmonic Minor scales as "variations" of the Natural Minor scale which are used for specific purposes in specific contexts, but are not truly independent scales in and of themselves.

Melodic Minor is shown as it is because most commonly, the notes are raised in ascending lines, and in their natural position for descending lines.

However, there are certainly exceptions to that. But it's just this what most commonly happens.

What happened is, someone underinformed at some point must have taken them as "true scales" and used them that way - a "scale based" method of thinking rather than "key based" manner of thinking. And that led to their use in this way so commonly that they did become - in other styles - scales in their own right, and can be treated modally, and so on.

But that's why some people make a distinction between "Melodic Minor" and "Jazz Minor" - because they're not quite the same thing.

_____

Students - I myself having been one - and now teaching them - have a tendency to "miss the point" a lot. In their defense, a lot of information is being thrown at them and it's much easier to grasp a "scale on paper" than it is to grasp a "concept that exists 'in the air' " so to speak.

So it is "simplified" in that regard.

For a TL/DR wyntonsucks's response is right on.

My response is to you "how does that make sense though" - they're different styles. In the earlier style there was no desire to treat this "scale" modally, so it's not even an issue.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, he's no longer playing Cmaj7.

C-G-D-A for example would be C6/9, or C-G-D-A-E-B would make it Cmaj13, or Cmaj9(13) in some circles.

(BTW, you said "non-diatonic to the chord" but that's not how it works - it's non-diatonic to the KEY - A and D are both in the key of C Major, so they're not "non-diatonic". It just makes it a C6/9 chord).

Adding the F# makes it CMaj13(#11).

Basically - here let me put it this way: We arrive at extensions/tensions in Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b> like so:

C-E-G-**B-D-F-A** and that's all 7 notes giving you a Triad, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th chord.

Usually though, that 11 is #11 on a Major chord or Major7th chord because of the m9 interval the regular 11 (F) would form with the 3rd of the chord (and "avoid note"). So people change it. Yes it's no longer "diatonic" so to speak, but people consider it a "C Lydian flavor".

If you stack 5ths a al Quintal voicings, you get the same results:

C G D A E B F# - all 7 notes again, in C Lydian again.

This is not really "Quintal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>", but tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> presented in 5ths (just like we might make a tertian chord in 3rds, OR, 6ths, like G-E-C etc.).

Quartal Voicings are kind of the 5ths "upside down".

However, like Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b> where we don't just play every chord in 3rds (or 6ths) - but CAN - there are a variety of voicings for 4th-based and 5th-based voicing, where they *might be* in 4ths or even 5ths, but often they're some combination of intervals but **predominantly** 4ths or 5ths.  C-G-A-E- would be a good example - C6 but that voicing is more "5th oriented" than C-E-G-A, which we'd consider more "3rd oriented" most likely. Likewise, G-C-E-A would likely be called a "quartal voicing" by many, even though it's a mix of 4ths and 3rds, but because the predominant interval is the 4th, it's more "4th oriented" (and more so when intentional on the part of the player).

Usually with Quartal or Quintal voicings, most people stay with PERFECT 4ths or 5ths.

That's why the F would be F# in a C chord - as that last 5th from B up to F# would be a perfect 5th, not B to F which would be a diminished 5th.

Basically, think of it this way:

C-E-G is "close voicing", and C-G-E is "open voicing". And they both have different sounds.

C-E-G-B and C-G-E-B as well as G-C-E-B all have different sounds.

It's kind of "neat" to voice chords in 4ths - especially because chords with more notes (9th through 13th chords) present more opportunities for including those intervals within the chord and increases the ability to voice them as 4ths/5ths.

Also, if you're building in 3rds, well then higher extensions can only "fit between" those 3rds as 2nds (not counting higher octaves). If you're building in 4ths or 5ths, there's more space in between notes to fit in other notes. So if we add a 9th to C-E we get a cluster, C-D-E.

But do it with C-G and we get C-D-G  - a more "open" and less "clustery" sounding chord.

Finally, some of these voicings can be ambiguous (at least, on their own, out of context) and that can open up the door for a little fun with the listener's expectations, or, to make other improvisational choices available.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You can't play "Fur Elise" on Ukulele, unless you play an arrangement of it designed for Ukulele.

You could play the MELODY to FE, or you play the CHORDS to FE to accompany someone else playing the melody.

Most music consists of "Melody With Accompaniment" On some instruments, you can play only the melody because they can only play one note at a time. You can also play one part of the Accompaniment if more than one note is played at a time in the Accompaniment (though some accompaniments can be simple one-line or one-note-at-a-time things).

But usually the accompaniment is played on a CHORDAL instrument, such as Piano, Guitar, etc. - or a group of instruments capable of playing notes together to make chords like a Guitar might.

Ukulele can play chords, but with only 4 strings, and the tuning, it's not really designed to play melody with accompaniment. Again, there certainly can be arrangements that do so, but it's going to typically be more practical to play EITHER the melody or the chord, not both. Especially for a piece that is as complex as FE in its original context. Again, it would have to be modified (heavily) in order to play it.

You would be best to find a Tab that has only the melody, or only the chords.

If you can find an arrangement with both melody and some parts of chords included, that can make it sound a little more full and like a solo piece (i.e. people would recognize it more as a "complete" arrangement of the piece).

By nature, there's going to be no one definitive version. Each of these - Melody alone, Chords alone, Melody with simple <b><u>harmony</u></b> alone - will all be an arrangement and sometimes those arrangements will work better in one key than another - so there may be 10 or 12 different versions out there (and the number could be infinite).

Choose the one that sounds best to you for what you want to do. If you're playing the melody then drop out to play a chord on a note or two, it won't necessarily sound like the piece in all likelihood.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> uses KEYS not scales.

The only place you would most often encounter an Augmented 2nd is in a Minor Key, when the 7th scale degree is raised, which would produce an Augmented 2nd between b6 and 7.

This interval is melodically dissonant, however, it's also wrong to assume dissonant intervals are "against the rules". They are just treated with a lot more restrictions (rules) than consonant intervals are.

That skip is found commonly when the <b><u>harmony</u></b> being outlined is a o7 chord. It's also found as a o7 interval which is also "dissonant" in melodic situations. Bach's "Invention in D Minor" has one right at the beginning as does the main Subject from the "Art of the Fugue".

And none of this has anything to do with any temperament.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No, progression are not the "identity" of the song.

That's why they're not copyrightable!

You may have just shoved random chord *under* it, but you just happened in this case to happen on a set of chords that worked! Maybe it's an omen you should buy a lottery ticket today!!!

But it could be that you subconsciously were reminded of the Pachelbel thing when you heard the melody and that may even in part be what triggered you to try it.

At any rate, there are two broad approaches to making music:

The "Classical" way is to have a Melody first, which you then Harmonize by putting chords that match the melody (or, the melody and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> are conceived of roughly together).

The "Pop" way is to have a Chord Progression first, which you then "Melodize" by putting a melody on top of.

Some styles, like Jazz, still do the Classical way in that you will often take a Melody from say, a standard, but Reharmonize it.

It's actually very sad to me that so many people on forums like this know nothing other than 4 chord loops and that's what they think all music is made of, or aren't interested in anything besides that. I think because it's "easy" and they're looking for a shortcut to be an "artist" rather than a musician.

That said, it's so prevalent now though it is a valid technique. And good melodies can still be written to existing harmonies (and in a sense, every 12 Bar Blues song in standard form is kind of an example of this).

But music isn't (or maybe shouldn't be) "about" chords. Melody is your main character. The chords are just the setting the action takes place in. Yes, sometimes they can be a more important part, but usually, the chord progression is just not that important - it's only 1 of MANY elements in music, many of which take more precedence or at least are on equal footing.

You could get other theory texts that approach the material from other perspectives and that can help give you more insight into what you already learned.

You can look at historical Treatises. Rameau's "Traite" is a good one as it kind of shows the thinking at the time (early 1720s) moving from a more Contrapuntal/Linear way of thinking to a more Chordal/Vertical way of thinking.

Also as a point of interest from the same time, Fux's "Gradus ad Parnassum".

There's a lot of Public Domain books on IMSLP you can find for free - like most of the Ebenezer Prout stuff.

An interesting book is Tenney's "History of Consonance and Dissonance" which can be found online in PDF form (though it's not in Public Domain, so...)

Vincent Persichetti's "20th Century <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" is definitely worth owning.

If you're interested in other compositional aspects, Adler's "Orchestration" is a must have. Walter Piston wrote "Counterpoint", "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>", and "Orchestration" texts, all worth a read. Rimsky-Korsakov's "Principles of Orchestration" is in the Public Domain and can be found free online.

If you're interested in Notation, Gardner Read's book is good, but the new standard seems to be Elaine Gould's "Behind the Bars" or similar title. I'd prefer Kurt Stone's "Music Notation in the 20th Century" but it's unfortunately out of print (he also wrote a Counterpoint text which I believe is still in print).

Robert Gualdin's book on <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is really good, but if you're into counterpoint, his two books on 16th and 18th century counterpoint "A Practical Approach to.." are both worth having. Knud Jeppesen's "Counterpoint" is considered the bible on 16th century style.

As a super nerd, I actually enjoyed Anthologies of musical examples to analyze/study. Any of the Norton stuff is good in this respect.

Alfred Mann's book on "Fugue" is nice if you're into that.

Some texts specifically on Form would be wise.

Then you've got Schenkerian Analysis, and Post-Tonal Theory (Straus, etc.)

Other books in translation - Hindemith, Schoenberg - and not to forget Schoenberg's on <b><u>Harmony</u></b> text (which is quite good, though a little wordy and didactic as well as "old school" in terms of tone and approach - but it's standard tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> which he knew as well as anyone).

Then there are all kinds of composer biographies and so on.

Definitely some books you should own are things like the Harvard Dictionary of Music or the Encylopedia of Music (Norton maybe...) - but a good Music Dictionary/Encyclopedia are nice to have unless you're dead set on using Wikipedia for all your musical knowledge :-)

Obviously, as a student, you should still have access to the Music Library if you have one, and you could just go through the MT section and find what interests you. That's what I did. Take advantage of that Tuition!!!

Finally, this is a great place for Academic type info outside of the academic world (i.e. open to everyone):

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I kind of get why you're asking that.

If you think about old style newsprint in color, the colors you see are not "Purple" but it's a bunch of little red dots interspersed with blue dots (and why Color printers only need Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black to make all colors).

So our eye kind of "averages" the red and blue dots to "see" just one new thing - Purple.

However, if you ever look closely at it, you can still kind of see the "red-ness" and "blue-ness" in Purple printed this way.

That's how <b><u>harmony</u></b> works. We do kind of "average" the notes to make a "new color", but in sound they don't blend as well - the dots are not fine enough of a resolution so they still kind of stand out as individual components as well.

So we hear this 1 thing - "a chord", but we can still discern the individual components as well - which is just the way our brain (and hearing mechanism) deals with sound.

Some have argued that it is a survival trait so that we could hear say, the difference in the wind rustling through the grass and the tiger approaching in the same grass!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You should ask u/Vornska or u/Xenoceratops about Schenkerian Analysis suggestions.

I don't know of anything specifically about Impressionist theory, but most modern texts now include much more about it in chapters about "post tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" as we're getting further and further from that time period and it's more accepted and studied.

A more general book like the Persichetti touches on it in chapters as well.

This is a traditional "Lead Sheet" from "fake books" which have become the standard form of notating Jazz songs like this.

The other, more common in "pop" style is "Piano/Vocal/Guitar Sheet Music" (or P/V/G). 

https://s3.amazonaws.com/halleonard-pagepreviews/HL_DDS_0000000000335041.png

You'll notice here that the Vocal has its own staff (half way down the page) when it comes in and the Piano is on Grand Staff with its notes.

These are typically "arrangements" of the song with the bare-bones info and very often - as is the case here - the upper notes of the piano part play the melody.

This is so the piece can be performed as a solo piano piece, or with vocals, and the vocalist gets the reinforcement from the part being written in the piano part as well (however, sometimes the piano is independent and doesn't have any of the vocal notes in it - just depends on the song and who did the arrangement).

Usually they also include Chord Symbols as well as Guitar Chord Diagrams (pretty much as a general rule nowadays). So it will say "Gm" and have a little chord box that shows a guitarist how to play the Gm (sometimes these will be a generic Gm chord, other times they will be a more specific voicing intended to mimic the original song more faithfully).

However, guitarists and bass players will still just look at the Chord Symbols and "make up" their own part (or will copy what's on the recording in a case like this).

If you want a more specific Piano Part that's not really improvised, but want to provide a bass player (or any other musician such as a guitarist) info on what notes/<b><u>harmony</u></b> to provide, you would use chord symbols (the "N.C." at the beginning means "no chord" and even though a Gm chord is implied, in the real song the guitar plays on its own and just plays a little banjo-like lick so they're not "strumming chords" or anything like that - the bass actually doesn't enter until the 2nd verse (unless it plays on a few hits, I can't remember - even the piano part here is not accurate to what's going on musically - but they needed to make something the player could play to support the vocalist and this is how they arranged it).

Look at some Lead Sheets, and some Piano/Vocal/Guitar Sheet Music.

If you only use a Lead Sheet, any keyboardist will simply look at the chord symbols and make up their own part, just like a bass player would.

Finally, only if you want to specify what the bass player is to play would you add a staff for them. So there's no need to write out anything for them based on what you said, though it could be the same as the lowest note of the piano part - some players will use that as a guide.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>C/G would simply mean a C chord with a G as the lowest sounding note (we often say "in the bass" - which isn't necessarily he instrument, but could be).

C/B is also often called Cmaj7/B because putting the B in with the C chord makes it a Cmaj7 chord.

Again, it is a C (or Cmaj7) <b><u>harmony</u></b> with B as the lowest sounding note.

These symbols have NOTHING to do with how any chord is voiced (how the notes are distributed) or what octave any of the notes are in. It solely tells you the "<b><u>harmony</u></b>/bass note".

If the <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is Dm7, then you need some form of D, F, A, and C present (though 5ths of chords are often omitted) and then if it's Dm7/X - whatever letter X is goes in the bass.

Dm7/F could be:

A

D

C

F

with any of those notes in any octave (as long as the F is still the lowest) or even:

C

A

F

D

F

F

F (three octaves of F below the D).

It doesn't matter.

If you see the notes C, E, G, and B, and B is the lowest sounding note, then the Chord Symbol is C/B (or Cmaj7/B but some people opt for the shorter one as a matter of convenience).

It's imperative to understand that Chord Symbols in NO way tell you WHERE to play the notes or how many of them to play, simply only WHAT notes are to be played and which one of those will be the lowest sounding note. That's it.

Many people try to use Chord Symbols to specify voicings but that's not what they are intended for and many would say, shouldn't be used for.

They are, "suggestions" in that sense - "please play a C <b><u>harmony</u></b> with a B in the bass" "How do you want me to voice it" "Any way you want, as long as the B is the lowest note".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Let's just say, I think you'd find it much easier to write songs if you had learned 3,000 songs rather than just a dozen or so. IOW, 1 year of Jazz Band, or even 4 years for most people, isn't enough playing experience to write well.

And Trumpet of course can only play one note at a time so it either plays the melody, or plays "lines" that are part of a <b><u>harmony</u></b>, rather than the full <b><u>harmony</u></b> itself.

So it can be a little better for being able to write melodies - because that's a lot of what you might play, but, it's harder for chords becasue it's not at chordal instrument.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>One thing I think a lot of people miss is, there are a lot of cultures out there. So another question becomes, do ALL cultures have "happy" and "sad" music, and is it universally accepted that anything within a certain level of "minor-3rd-ness" is considered by all of them to be "sad" (I say minor-3rd-ness because not all cultures use the same types of scales or tuning systems).

I've brought up "Taps" many times to show that something "in major" can be "sad" due to cultural use; that "Taps" is played at funerals and most people are familiar with it from that unfortunate situation, so they naturally associate it with sadness despite it being major.

So one of two things is happening there: either there is no inherent "happiness" or "sadness" in the Scale/Key/<b><u>Harmony</u></b> of Minor and it's all cultural, or - and this is actually the **more important thing to a musician** - that even if there is any inherent "mood" associated with Maj/Min, **it can be overcome by other factors**.

This is something that the "overtone chasers" don't get. Because - [dons flame suit] - many (maybe even most) don't actually play or make music. Or if they do, it's all experimental (which is fine) or just not very good.  People who are so worried if some interval is consonant or not are wasting a lot of their time because it doesn't actually matter in **music**.

Everyone's all up in arms about the Perfect 4th - whether it is objectively consonant or dissonant. **It doesn't matter** because the way it **is used in actual music** over-rides that - it is **treated** as a consonance in some contexts, and a dissonance in others.

So, extending that, how can an interval be **both** consonant and dissonant and "variable" in that regard? Because **in music** use does not actually have anything to do with any inherent properties.

So how can Major be both happy (in most contexts we think of) **and** sad (as in "Taps"). Because even if there is any inherent property of the Key/Scale/<b><u>Harmony</u></b>/Interval, music is an **Art** and we can do other things to over-ride it, or it can find itself in circumstances that over-ride expectations and so on.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You learn to make music by learning to make music! Sorry that sounded nebulous but what it means is that you listen to tons of music, learn to play tons of music, tear apart, figure out, or otherwise "analyze" tons of music to see what's going on and what does what, and then put those elements back together into your own piece - which may take tons to get something good.

Some tips:

"Composition" and "Songwriting" are different things. "Producing" is on the Songwriting side. Schoenberg was a Composer. If you want "pro tips" from a Songwriter you need to look at great Songwriters - Lennon and McCartney, Prince, and so on.

Keys have nothing to do with "mood" beyond Major and Minor (and maybe modes which are different "flavors" if you like, and there are other scales beyond those that have other flavors as well). Picking C Major, or D Major, or F  Major won't change the "mood" because they're all Major. So there's no need to worry about it from that standpoint. Just pick a Key and work with it (though it will help much more if you understand them thoroughly from all the music you learn).

Melody and <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - learn it from the music of others. Find people whose music you like and figure out what they did. Then copy and steal - that's what they did.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes, I have used them. Dorian and Mixolydian especially.

However, there's a bit of a misunderstanding about how people think about these scales.

In almost all cases, what they're actually doing is using a Major or Minor KEY (or Mode) and simply, while improvising, leaving two notes out.

So it's not like you're playing "the Mixolydian Pentatonic Scale", but you're playing "in Mixolydian, leaving out two notes".

Because again in almost all cases the <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is still full Mixolydian, etc.

This is true even of the basic M/m pents - people say "I'm using the Major Pent" - well, I suppose, yes that's true - YOU might be using what you identify as a Major Pent scale - but everyone else is just playing Major! The V chord isn't going to leave out scale degree 7 just because you're noodling away on pentatonic :-)

Now, that's super common, so it's not "wrong", but my point is that conceptually speaking, most people using pent scales (or hexatonic scales as well) are doing so because they're "justifying" them because they have - names. Because X scale is "Hirajoshi", they say "I'm playing Hirojoshi over this progression".

But the funny thing is - and is very kind of myopic to me - this is actually a **limitation** because people will only experiment with subsets of the whole scale that "have names".

But there's no reason not to use 4 note scales, or 6 note scales, or to even use other 5 note scales that aren't "named". It was a very popular trend among French composers in the early part of the 20th century to write "5 fingers" music - where the notes for the melody were a - as we'd call it today - "pentatonic scale" - C-D-E-F-G.

But that's something no one (especially guitarists) today would think about doing - because it's not a "named" Pentatonic.

And that still boils down to **restricting your note set** for melody, or improv, etc., from a larger note set (such as Major) to create a particular sound.

So IOW, most Pents are treated like **subsets** of Major or Minor (or as with the ones you post here, Modes) rather than being used as true "stand alone" scales that make up the entire melodic and harmonic content of the piece.

That's not to invalidate them or anything (or validate them) but my point is, don't get caught up in the names or any "justification", other than sound.

Yes there are others. Use them all, named or not!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Assuming you're a total beginner at analysis, your best bet is to start with Common Practice Period music for a couple of reasons.

Firstly, there so much material out there about you shouldn't have any trouble finding resources.

Secondly, because everything was "common practice" and relatively consistent, it's easier to learn and understand, and makes for a perfect "core" of information to work outward (and earlier and later) from.

Thirdly, it is in many cases still somewhat relevant to very relevant in music written past that time period, continuing through right now. And it is also somewhat adaptable to styles descended from it.

I would suggest you watch all of Seth Monahan's You Tube series on Classical <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvtB3DH7K94

Some of it begins very basic, but it covers a lot of topics that start to already dive much deeper than just the surface elements so not only does it make a great site to get the core concepts from, but one that gives you ideas for digging deeper.

Traditionally, Universities still teach in this way because of these reasons. I've often said it would probably make more sense to study things chronologically, but really, even Machaut is very different from Bach, so it's not really as helpful to what is still in use today than Bach is.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I would say by definition, if it's non-functional, it can't have "non-functional functionality" :-)

I think maybe what you're looking for is, "in the absence of Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, which usually ties things together in a logical progression, is there something else going on instead?"

And I'd say in many many cases yes! So I suppose on some level you could call it a different kind of functionality.

I've seen a West Coast Blues/Jump Blues/Western Swing Guitarist call it "inner logic" in his lessons and I actually like that. So I'm going to borrow that term.

Composers seem to want, or need, or like to have some kind of Inner Logic to what they write, whether it's obvious to the listener or not. One of the most common ones in music is Sequence.

You can have Harmonic Sequences or Melodic Sequences - they are ideas that are repeated at different pitch levels.

A good example is the Pachelbel Canon progression:

C - G - Am - Em - F - C - F - G

It's functional at the end, but otherwise it's kind of going the wrong way - away from C instead of towards C (C-G-Am is not bad, but the Em is definitely unusual).

But if you look closely, it's Down a 4th Up a 2nd. So the pairs of chords C-G, then Am-Em, then F-C are Sequential.

That Sequence makes for an "inner logic" that satisfies us and maybe "hides" the fact that there is some funkiness happening with the Functional Progression.

The line here is on Saxophone, which is a Transposing instrument - notice it's key is only 1 Flat - not 4.

This kind of line is not functional, nor is it meant to be. But it does have some Inner Logic.

The first three notes, A-G-Bb represent an "enclosure" in Jazz terms, but also historically a "Cambiata Figure" or double-neighbor tone figure. Usually it would go A-G-Bb-A (or A-Bb-G-A) but here the Bb begins a Sequence.

There's Bb - F- E (down a P4 then down a m2) followed by Ab-Eb-D which is the same interval pattern just down a step, and then that D-C#-E is another  partial enclosure.

The C# is used because it's leading up to the E and in this key, which is like Dm, the C# would be common as the leading tone.

The implication of the last notes are C7, Dm, A for a sort of "half cadence".

Now because the Sax is transposing - it looks like Dm but is actually Fm - so it's written a "third down" if you like so it sounds a 3rd up. It starts on A, so that's actually a C - so it's actually the same exact lick the Piano plays, except the piano's end is a bit different.

The last chord in the piano could be a Db as far as I can tell. I think they may have chosen C# because it mirrors the Sax lines better. It's basically an Eb7 chord, with an F Harmonic Minor over it when the Sax starts. That in itself is "non-functional" - it's kind of like a "half cadence" but Czardas is not a "classical" piece and arrangements of it often keep the folk/modal elements which is what's going on here (there's also an Eb when not necessary because the note was just there two notes ago!).

This line might imply some kind of <b><u>harmony</u></b> but IMHO it's more about the Inner Logic - it's a line bookended by two enclosures, with the middle being Sequential.

The <b><u>harmony</u></b> of C from the previous measure (Half Cadence, or Dominant chord) could be seen as being implied - the notes would just form alterations/tensions to the Dominant <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. Whether all of them are chord tones, or some are non-chord tones, etc. is anyone's guess. I don't really think that's the important thing though.

So we could say there is Function here - that of the C chord in the measure before, which is essentially "holding" or "being prolonged" by these two runs, and then the F Harmonic Minor Run essentially continues - so we could say this is all a Dominant Prolongation - just an embellished C <b><u>Harmony</u></b> until the Fm comes back on the next page.

In a sense though, it's more "filler" and a chance to get some showy licks in - whether they "mean anything" from a functional standpoint or not. It's the "Inner Logic" that ties them together and makes them "make sense" in the context of this holding C <b><u>harmony</u></b>, waiting for the  Fm chord to return. As long as they don't sound too much like an early arrival of the Fm chord, they'll serve their purpose.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Because it shifts by whole step the accidentals get kind of funky.

I would make the 2nd measure Eb-D-Bb and the 3rd measure Db-C-Ab to avoid any double sharps.

The last measure could be Cb-Bb-Gb but you may prefer B-A#-F# as it is - it would have to switch at some point to avoid double flats.

You're right, you're basically implying Major 7th chords - Fmaj7 - Ebmaj7 - Dbmaj7 - Cbmaj7 (Bmaj7).

However, you could imply other chords with a Bass line or other <b><u>harmony</u></b> part. For example, if you put a D note under the first measure you'd have a Dm9 sound.

So it could be kind of cool to have a Bass line that goes D-Eb-Bb-B so it's Dm9 - Ebmaj7 - Bbm9 - Bmaj7.

So there are other options - it might be really cool to have a Bass line that ascends in Major 2nds against the upper part descending in Major 2nds. That movement is by "whole tone scale" if you like, which is often used in films for spooky or dream sequences. Not exactly the same, but check out the Theme for Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" composed by Bernard Hermann. It has that uneasy, queasy, out-of-balance feeling which relies on some whole tone elements.

If that's what you want, using the bass line that follows it down (F-Eb-Db-B or even D-C-Bb-Ab) might sound kind of cool as would having it ascend (F-G-A-B might produce interesting chords, but try some others).

None of this is going to be in a Key and you just have to take each chord on a case by case basis.

But it produces a "Sequence" which has it's own form of "Inner Logic" I was just talking about in another thread - which makes up for the fact that it doesn't stay in any one key.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;When I try to use other diatonic chords from the key it just ends up sounding like the relative major or minor.

Yeah, that's kind of the problem.

We are SO ingrained in Major/Minor that it's impossible for us to "unhear" it.

As a result, to stay modal, we have to avoid anything too major or minor like the plague.

That's why a lot of modal music is vamps - in some ways it negates the whole Pre-Dominant - Dominant - Tonic aspects of tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> and allows you to orient to the mode.

However, I would say that far too many people put far too much emphasis on chord progression. Music should be first and foremost about Melody (at least in most cases). Then there's Rhythm - everyone forgets about rhythm - rather than a 1 chord per measure 4 chord loop, it would be nice to see people not only add some rhythmic interest beyond strumming patterns and maybe even, oh, I don't know, hold 1 chord for 3 beats and play another for just 1!!!

There are tons of 12 Bar blues out there and obviously many of them have the exact same or very similar progressions. But it's all about the melody - that's where the interest is.

I think it's a fallacy to think more chords = more interest or even "taller" chords = more interest or more complex chords = more interest and so on.

That said, probably the best way to "expand" basic modal vamps is to shift key centers or change modes. So you're in A Dorian and you change to A Mixolydian. Or you're in A Dorian and you move to C Phrygian or something.

That opens up a lot more possibilities than just staying in one mode and trying to use more chords of that mode.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes - it's implied.

The assumption is that it would still be an Am if the E were present, so we call it what it would be if the chord were complete. And really, we hear it that way - the root and 3rd are enough to imply the chord (plus, having already heard the E, we still kind of comprehend that as the likely note that would be there).

I should mention though, with any guitar part (or other chordal instrument part) there's likely something else going on - Vocals, Bass, Keys, etc. So it's very likely someone else could be playing the E note to "complete" the chord. Chord Symbols are typically (and should be) based on the <b><u>harmony</u></b> created by all the instruments.

So this is an "incomplete" chord. On Guitar, Power Chords are super common and "incomplete" in the sense that they're missing the 3rd of the chord. And it is possible to arpeggiate them as well.

Usually, unless the bass is playing another note or it's implied, you need at least the Root and 3rd, or Root and 5th, or maybe, the Root and 7th.

IOW, arpeggiating just the 3rd and 5th is going to sound like a different chord (again unless some other instrument has the root or it's otherwise strongly implied - and it can be in some common patterns).

It's kind of common on guitar to keep the two strings that are the upper notes of the arpeggio on the same strings while the bass note moves to notes on both the 6th and 5th string - doing that with Em to Am would cause exactly that if you used the 2nd and 3rd strings for the upper notes.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not to sound mean or dismissive, but that's not how Music Theory works.

There's no "theory behind it" - it nor any other song. All Music Theory does is describe elements within the song, not what explain why people think what they think about them (that's psychology).

There are probably millions of people out there who hate that song and don't think it's catchy at all.

There are probably plenty who also think a lot of other songs are far more catchy, and actually have more involved musical aspects (that can be described with Music Theory) and that this song, by comparison, is "less catchy" because it doesn't have those elements (which is a falsehood, but that's they're thinking).

IOW, you find it catchy because something about your musical experiences throughout your life and even extra-musical aspects have made it seem catchy to you (things like the Video, the pronunciation, the production, the lyric content, where you were when you first heard it, or someone else said, "that's kind of catchy" and you just subconsciously picked up on that - any number of reasons that have nothing to do with "it's in G", or "it uses I-IV-V with a brief excursion to ii").

One thing it does have is a very "melodious" melody - and that could make it stand out to you as being more catchy than whatever else you might listen to. But even if it is the melody, we don't have many theoretical terms for what happens in melodies - in fact, it's very under-represented in music as most things focus on <b><u>harmony</u></b>. ALl you can to is describe it in general terms - direction, range, activity, phrasing, and how it relates to the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, especially at phrase endings and beginnings. However, melodies with very similar elements might not be as catchy (to you, or to others) and melodies without those elements might be just as catch (to you, or to others). IOW, catchiness has to do with far more other factors than anything able to be described my Music Theory.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It could, but often the the Bass will just double the lowest note of the Guitar (an octave lower). So if the guitar plays low E, then G-B-E on the upper three strings, the Bass might play its low E, which is an octave below the guitar's note.

But it is possible that the Bass play a note like E, and the guitarist arpeggiate G-B-E above that or even after it, as if the Bass player had taken the Guitarist's lowest note for them.

But more typically, the Guitar often acts as its own accompaniment - its lowest note serving as the bass note, and filling out the <b><u>harmony</u></b> with its upper notes, with the Bass either doubling the lowest note, or playing something completely independent.

Just depends on the effect they want.

Learn enough songs and this starts to become clearer.

Cheers
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Right - usually Pentatonic is used as a subset as u/ChuckEye said.

The chords still come from the scale of which the Pentatonic is a subset.

So if you have D Major Pentatonic, the chords will be from D Major as well - the Pent is essentially a subset of D Major.

There are other uses of Pentatonic Scales though - for example, in blues the Minor Pentatonic is used in an otherwise Major (or Mixolydian) context to produce "blue notes".

And you can use other pentatonics that create other subsets of a scale to produce different flavors - for example, in D Major, you could use an A Major Pentatonic scale (which still has notes from D Major in it) to give it a kind of "Major 7" type feel (because it has C# where D Major Pent doesn't).

____

You can - and many people have - use solely the notes from your Pentatonic (or any scale you choose for that matter) as the pitch content for both melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

How you make chords then is up to you - some follow a traditional "every other note" thing which in Dm Pentatonic would make:

D-G-C

F-A-D

G-C-F

A-D-G

C-F-A

So some are triads and some are quartal chords - which gives you a little bit of tradition with 2 chords and something less common with the other 3.

However you could make chords out of every note in a row if you wanted, or use some other methodology. Depends on what kind of sound you want.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not typically, and not always.

Certainly the progression C - Dm7 - G7 - C is not going to support C Lydian very well.

C Lydian is often used over a Tonic Major 7 chord as the #11 would be a typical extension of that <b><u>harmony</u></b>. But you wouldn't typically wail C Lydian over that progression I just put!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; Edit: I also fail to see how the F# in that case wouldn't work. Like obviously your going to change the <b><u>harmony</u></b> or clash with the middle chords if your choosing that note on a harmonic piller. But, if you pass with the note it only adds a little tension, which sounds amazing.

That's a different thing though - you're not really "using that scale" so to speak, but "using that note" which is subtly different.

For example, "Fur Elise" by Beethoven begins famously on the 5th degree of the scale and drops to the #4 and goes back and forth a couple of times, and is in "A" (A Minor really - but for example's sake). We don't say he borrowed that from Lydian or is in Lydian.

It's just a lower chromatic neighbor, that's all.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm going to shoot out a couple of things here:

1. Functions are not chords. Functions are "roles" that chords can fulfill. Not every V chord has Dominant Function, and not every Dominant Role is filled by a V chord. Depending on the school you subscribe to, there are only 3 (or 4) roles, and obviously there are 7 chords in the key, so some of the roles have to be taken on by more than 1 chord.

2. Common Practice Period music (CPP) uses a scheme of PD - D - T rather religiously. But modern popular music does not, and even eschews it. So much so that even talking about "Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" outside of CPP music is often useless. Rather than looking for "functional progressions" you just need to forget that stuff and just look at chord progressions. Some patterns may be functional, and that's OK, but many are not, and that's still OK. It's 2019, not 1789.

3. I don't know anyone who cares about function one bit when they're writing. No one I know sits around going "I need a Dominant chord here because I just had a Pre-Dominant". That's not how people compose (or at least, how they should be composing). I'm sure maybe some do but that's because they don't really understand how music works or lack the musical experience to know any better. And that comes with playing tons of music and paying attention to what's going on beneath the surface.

Had the people who wrote "(I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone" for The Monkees been concerned with harmonic function they wouldn't have come up with E - G - A - C as the main progression. In fact, there's never even a Dominant chord in the piece. People just don't write music that way, or again, if they do, they're kind of uninformed (that doesn't include those who *intuit* harmonic function that informs their chord choices).

Learn songs. Lots of them.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Your melody should be written in the key of your <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and your <b><u>harmony</u></b> should be created out of the same key as your melody.

If you modulate from one key to another in the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, then the melody should also modulate to the same keys.

However, when you say "temporarily" it depends on what you mean.

A progression like C - E - Am - G is NOT a modulation. It's just a "Tonicization".

In that case, you can remain in C, except for dealing with any notes that need to change over the E chord (since it's not in the key).

But if it was like this:

C - F - G7 - C - G - Bm - E7 - Am - Dm - E7 - Am - F - G - Am  - Am

Then yes, you'd want to "focus" your melody on C in the first half, and A in the 2nd half.

However, since C Major and A Minor do share the same notes in their keys, and even the two chords share two notes, it's of course possible that phrases in both halves focus on E or C (the shared notes) rather than C and A.

But music doesn't work that specifically either - usually the melody will end on a Chord tone. So it could end on C, E, or G in the key of C, and A, C, or E in the key of Am, assuming those are the chords the melody ends on.

As you can see there's some overlap there.

But you don't want to take "Ode to Joy" which is pretty strongly a Major mode piece - say, in C, and put Am chords under it - you could make it work of course, but you're also not really being true to the Key.

You need to learn to play some major and minor melodies along with their chord progressions, then you'll be able to internalize this much better.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Just some food for thought:

Usually we use "stand-alone-ness" as a condition by which to judge such harmonies.

In a case like "Creep", where the "III" chord is an entire measure, it "stands alone" as its own <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

It is therefore considered a V/vi that resolves deceptively - in fact has a name: Decpetive Resolution of a Secondary Dominant.

It's like V - VI in the key of the vi chord, or V/vi to VI/vi, but we just put the V/vi - IV with the understand that those symbols like that imply DRofaSD.

However, the standard move in Blues to either chromatically walk up or down through #IV or bV is not a secondary in any way - just chromatic linear motion - "connective tissue" so to speak.

Same is true if the III were to approach IV as just a short duration note (which usually limits or removes its "stand-alone-ness") especially where the IV was much more prominent, it would again just sound like a "chromatic approach" as in the VII - I of "Hound Dog".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Like so:

https://musescore.com/user/32723609/scores/5654778

Granted, this is just a very short, and simple example and the sound is cheesy, but it gives you an idea.

But you can't just go against all the pre-concieved notions that all your listeners are going to have - they're all conditioned to hear Major/Minor.

This is why even in other modes without the Diminished "tonic" chord (Center is a better word) you have to be careful - you don't want to use an A7 in D Dorian or else it make just sound too much like D Minor.

So to "un-Tonalize" modal music, people very often avoid any tonal trappings like the plague. The more "tonal baggage" you introduce, the more a danger there is of it drifting towards Major - in fact, we couldn't even use Minor "as is" with Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> because it always sounded like it was drifting towards the Relative Major. We had to "subvert" it by changing some chords.

So you're going to have to "subvert" the tendencies to be heard as Major/Minor/Some other mode.

And to do this you have to basically beat your listener over the head with the Center ("tonic").

Others have suggested other strategies - non-tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>, just avoiding the b5 in the "tonic" chord altogether. So mine is yet another solution that allows you to keep your goal of having the diminished triad as "home" - but at the expense of using more elaborate melodic lines or other chords. But I spent all of the amount of time in took me to input it into Musescore (which I'm not very familiar with) to "compose" it and I'm sure given some more time, something longer, more elaborate, etc. could be devised.

That said, it's kind of a moody little ditty, and I like it. Think I'll keep it :-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>E is the Root.

It would only be the Tonic if it were also the "home" note of the Key.

There is no way to write a Chord Symbol that anyone will play these three notes this way.

You write it "E-G-A". That's the way to guarantee it is played like that. IOW, you need to NOTATE it, not use a Chord Symbol, because Chord Symbols don't tell you how to play a chord, other than which note is the lowest and what the resultant <b><u>harmony</u></b> should be.

When we write "C" it doesn't mean C-E-G specifically. It could be C-G-E, it could be C-C-E-G, it could be C-G-C-E-G-C-E, or C-E-G-C-E, or C-G-C-E-G-C

Likewise if you write any of the suggestions people give you here, it doesn't mean someone seeing the symbol wouldn't play many more notes. 

Eadd11(no5) is probably the easiest, but anyone seeing that symbol might play E-A-E-G or E-A-G, or E-E-A-G or any other thing they see fit.

If you specifically want E-G-A, you need to write out the notes.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is down to listening experience.

Take your last example, and do this:

E - G - C

C - D - E

And you have "Horn 5ths" (though they're usually arranged with the upper line being the lower). It's a super familiar sound (The melody part to the theme from "Peanuts" (you know, Snoopy) uses this idea!).

So, let's clear up a few things.

A Passing Tone, "officially" is on a weak beat (or weak part of the beat).

So it would be:

E - F - G

C -(C) -E

(to be clear, q q h in the upper part, and h h in the lower)

The analog in the other part would be:

E-(E)-G

C-D-E

Now, neither of those sound "great". They're close together, and the independence of the lines is confused. They also both create something called "voice-overlap". Usually voice-overlap is when a note of the lower voice jumps up and takes a note *higher* than the upper voice just had, like so:

E - A

C - F

The F "crosses above" or "overlaps" the E and it makes it sound to our ears like the E moved to F, rather than A. So this again confuses the ear, and obscures the melody and the movement of the parts, as well as their independence (which is part of the point of counterpoint!)

So while these don't cross above (or below - same issue can happen descending), having them end up on the same note will make it sound like the melody might be E-F-E rather than E-F-G.

Compare this with a more typically contrapuntal move:

E - F - G

C -(C) - B

There's *no doubt* that the E moves up to G, and the C moves down to B.

That's why, in Counterpoint, contrary motion is preferred because it helps the voices maintain their individual "flow" and continuity, thus remaining distinct/independent from each other and not getting "confused" with the others. This is why basic rules of Counterpoint at first forbid voice-crossing and parallel 5ths and 8ves, and frown on parallel motion in general, to be used sparingly (relatively speaking)

_____

In your examples assuming the rhythm is as you put, you have an "Accented Passing Tone" or "Appoggiatura" if it was like so:

E | F - G

C | E -(E)

Where the movement up top is q q ? and the movement below is q h, BUT the F happens on a strong beat or strong part of the beat - hence the barline to show that the C-E pair are on say the last quarter note of a measure.

But:

E - F | G

C - E | (E) 

would be kind of weird because it messes with the strong/weak parts of the beat.

So it could sound "funny" because:

1. Voice-Overlap (which is still present in any metric position)

2. Metric Position - PT, vs. Acc.PT/App. vs. "wrong" :-)

3. Problem with "open" intervals.

So this last one gets into why a Perfect 4th isn't used like this.

In 2 parts, the Perfect 4th is a dissonance (it is a dissonance in combination with the bass part in any texture in CPP music).

It could be created by a Passing Tone like one of the examples I already gave:

E - F - G

C -(C) - B

But, if you "accent" it, things get a little more problematic. Dissonances in counterpoint (and styles descended from that) resolve in rather typical ways and even if you really haven't studied a lot of it, unless things resolve "as we expect" they're going to sound funny.

Furthermore, the "open interval" of a P4 kind of "sticks out like a sore thumb" - and that's why they are *treated like* dissonances in music once people come to prefer the  "harmoniousness" of 3rds and 6ths. Even P5 intervals are cautiously dealt with. I'm sure you're familiar with all the hoopla about Parallel 5ths and that plays into part of that - that the parallelism reduces independence of the lines, AND it does it with an interval that's so freaking obvious to the listener - think of it with Parallel 8ves - if your counterpoint is all 3rds and 6ths with nice passing tones and what not, and then suddenly you have  parallel 8ves, it's going to sound like "the <b><u>harmony</u></b> dropped out" for a second. Not only that, the interval itself calls attention to itself and says, "hey every one look at me, I'm perfect, pay attention to me, me , me forget that old <b><u>harmony</u></b> stuff"!

Perfect 5ths - and Perfect 4ths do the same thing - they call attention to themselves in a way that undermines the harmoniousness of the texture, and when they're parallel, it's even worse.

But with a P5, there's at least a "stability" there and of course two 3rds "stacked" add up to a 5th. a P4 on the other hand sounds "unstable" and wants to invert on itself in a way - or at least "move towards something more stable" - which is why in CPP music whenever there is a P4 between the bass and an upper voice, that interval is considered a dissonance and needs to resolve. And the way it resolves comes from the long standing tradition of counterpoint that pre-dates it.

So this P4 may sound "funny" to you because it's an "open" interval, and by playing it in this metric pattern, it "calls even more attention to itself" and it doesn't resolve in a traditional manner, including the voice-overlap issue, so it just sounds "even way more funky" to you than the first one.

However, as I said, to me, my listening experience "hears that as" Horn 5ths (though inverted) because it's a familiar pattern and it actually bothers me less than your first pattern! That's why I say it also has to do with your listening experiences and thus, expectations.

Finally, yes, "leaping to a dissonance" is also something that "calls attention" to a dissonant interval so it too is very carefully "controlled" in the way it is used. That alone could be what's bugging you but I think it's more a combination of all the factors I've mentioned.

HTH.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The idea of the Acoustic Root goes back to (and at least as far back as) Rameau's treatise on <b><u>harmony</u></b> of the 1720s.

In hit he even mentions the "duality" of what today we'd call an Am7 versus a C6 - because while the C6 is the same notes as the Am7, it has a "rootedness" of C because of the C-G pair (not to mention the C-E-G triad) in the chord. While chords like that weren't called "C6" back then, he does note the fact that when inverted, what we call an Am7 has this "dual" or "ambiguous" nature where the 3rd of the chord could be heard as the root.

There's also  the psychological issue of the "missing fundamental" which says basically that if we hear the overtone structure without the fundamental, or ears (or brain) kind of "fills in" the fundamental so we hear the note as being of that pitch.

Since the notes of the Augmented triad belie that harmonic series in that way, hearing the lowest note as root becomes problematic.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental

So in a sense, our ears (brains) are trying to make sense of C-E with a fundamental of C, then E-G# with a fundamental of E, then Ab-C with a fundamental of Ab all at the same time.

While these are not of course overtones specifically, they do create that impression for the listener.
</p></li><li><p><b>howto</b><br>Since you said you're more polite and educated on the subject, let's take that a step further:

Music from roughly 1650 - 1850 was called the "Common Practice Period" and that's because there was in fact a "common practice" - all composers basically used the same underlying methodology to create music.

In the 20th century however (and even in the later 1800s) the compositional world "fractured" if you like into multiple different methodologies.

Now, one thing I want to point out is that much music was and still is written using either CPP principles or those evolved/descended/expanded etc. from them.

So it would be wrong to say of course that ALL music is, for example, "random notes".

What I would suggest is that you seek out music that expands on what you already know rather than music that makes a complete break from traditional practices, at least to begin your exploration into these uncharted waters - and alien landscapes.

Here's a piece from 1936:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTXxxkVLx2I

At the opening it kind of reminds us of what you might think of as a "Western" movie soundtrack.

And one from 1953:

__________________

One thing that may help you with this is that music does not exist in a vacuum. Three important events happened in the transition from CPP music into the 20th century.

1. Turn of the century coupled with Industrial Revolution. Remember that the late 1800s saw the rise of industry, and technology - Telegraph, Telephone, Radio, Recording and Playback. Already in the late 1800s there were a group of people calling themselves "Futurists" that consisted of people in the art world who were saying, "we need to move forward". They were exploring new theoretical ideas, new art forms, and so on , and encouraging others to to the same. In some ways, it just didn't make sense to keep composing these cute little Viennese Waltzes when we were at the dawn of a new century where (hopefully) society would become equal (boy were they wrong on that one). But this feeling of "why are we still making art like that we did under the royalty/patronage system" comes to a head with:

2. The "Great War" - the first world war. This was DEVASTATING to Europe especially. Many European composers fled to America. Many were wiped out. But as a general rule, people who survived the horrors of WWI were like, "this whole polite society BS is what got us into this, and we need to uncover the harsh reality and not wish it away". The tensions leading up to the war, and after the war, meant people were just angry. They composed "angrily" in a way. The political and emotional turmoil in Europe manifested itself in Art. And I don't mean that art was all "turmoil" but just that "the old ways" didn't really seem all that relevant anymore. This was also true of WWII, and to some degree with Vietnam here in the US, but that more affected popular culture and popular music (not to mention the Cold War, and threat of Nuclear Destruction, which spawned tons of movies and books!!!).

3. Popular Music. Influences from Folk music, and later other popular forms (Jazz) also influenced the way "classical" composers wrote music and they were interested in incorporating and experimenting with those things.


Obviously the popular music influence was maybe less "shocking" to the musical culture because pop music ultimately was the more "tame" continuation of art music and it just kind of broke off, did it's own thing for a bit, injected some some new - but "traditional" - ideas, and circled back around and rejoined.

But those first two - societal upheaval. And it was reflected in art as they say.

So we really shouldn't "blame" composers for doing what they did - they felt it was their destiny so to speak.

_________

Furthermore, a way to understand what Schoenberg did was to look at it this way: Music at the end of the 1800s was already "ultra-chromatic" (this is in part what led the Futurists to believe there was a change coming) and Wagner, and Strauss, and Schoenberg - especially the latter two, were already composing music that had so much chromaticism and modulated so much, and rarely stayed in a single key for longer than a couple of chords, it got to a point with Schoenberg where he was like, "what's the point of putting in a Key Signature; what's the point of saying this is "in Db Major" ?" At some point, he figured, "I'm already writing music that completely lacks any kind of single Central Tone/<b><u>Harmony</u></b>/Key Center, so why not just find a systematic way to do that?" Ultimately he wrote "Atonality" (though he preferred the term Pantonality, which he saw as an more egalitarian system, which is apropos today...) and then developed a systematic way of guaranteeing Atonality in his music, which was to use all 12 notes in an "ordered" way, which is where we get "12 Tone Serialism". Other composers were influenced by these ideas and adopted them in their own way.

_______

With the advent of Technology, in a sense, "mainstream Romantic music" that wasn't quite as adventurous as Atonality and that path, made it's way into Film music. There are a HUGE amount of great film scores and composers who worked in Hollywood and wrote really wonderful music that not only supported the film, but could stand alone as concert works as well. And many of them actual wrote Concert Music as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAGSdAxZlw0

The opening fits the concept of the film - and sensation - Vertigo - perfectly. The "love theme" is at 5:00 (as some of the other stuff kind of needs the film scenes to make it more "in context" but still is interesting on its own). And when you see the movie, and this love theme, it's one of the major moments in Cinema (same could be said about the final gunfight in "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly").

So you can see there's plenty of great music out there. I think what happens (or happened) is that the ones with the "shock value" so to speak tend to get all the press. And as soon as there are ardent detractors from something, up will spring the fervent admirers who support it not necessarily because they themselves like it (though some do) but because they just want to argue with people who blindly dismiss something because it's different (also culturally relevant today).

_______

Now, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to in anyway say that this experimentation was "bad". It may have been "played up" some, and even intentionally used as incite-ful by some people (including the composers themselves), but is was partially a reaction to outside forces and natural evolution, and actually did influence more "mainstream" music.

And think about it - the "rebels" are always going to be more ardent supporters of "Punk" or "Indie" or "Metal" music - because the whole "stick it to the man" and "anti-establishment" stuff is always there. A lot of these composers were 20 year old rebels and no different in their society than kids today are. So there's always that thing to think about - we don't tend to think about them that way, but many of them were - Young men who were out to take on the world.

So there are a lot of factors that led the composers to do what they did. And moreover - like today as a matter of fact - they were living in a world where they felt a desperate need to "find their own voice" - and for many the best way to do that was to make a break with tradition.

______


Looking back, I like to see it as evolutionary branches that really, ultimately, came back into the fold. 12 Tone music didn't become the new way to compose that some thought it would be. However, it did sort of "come home" to "mainstream" concert music and have impact and influence.

But, the one thing that comes of all this is there is no "common practice", and each practice has to be taken on its own - which makes it really hard to study and define, because in many cases it wasn't any kind of "group" but it was down to a single individual composer's working method.

Thus larger trends are hard to find - or, if we can find a larger trend, such as "Experimentalism", each composer within that trend was experimenting in their own way.

But I think it becomes important to understand WHY they were doing this rather than HOW they were doing it. And I'm not saying that any one of these things or even all of them together would be the exact driving force behind the decisions any one composer made or makes, but that all of these things are factors that are either direct or indirect influences on what a composer decides to do and how they decide to work.

That can at least make you appreciate why composers were taking the paths they were, even if you don't care for the results.

_______

You could play random notes on a piano and call it a Sonata. You have that right. You may find ardent supporters in your right to do that, as well as in the music itself. Some will be doing it just to cause controversy - they like the fight - maybe even you might do it just to cause controversy, or to "prove a point".

I always find that to be disingenuous though. But my morals aren't everyone else's morals.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>A Waltz is usually just a Waltz. Not 2 movements. You'd have a movement that was a Waltz, and then another movement that was another movement.

I mean, the title could be "Two Waltzes for a Piano" and that would make far more sense.

This is a pet peeve of mine, so forgive me if I seem brusque, but don't put Opus numbers on your work. If this is in fact your 20th Published work, then you don't need our opinion. In fact, if you got a piece published, and it was Op. 1, you don't need our opinion. 

Publishers assign Opus numbers. Not the composer. Any who do are either naive, or disingenuous.

As for the music, there are some parts I find a little lacking.

There are a couple of passages like at the beginning and m.33 onwards where there's "nothing going on" - it goes on too long without any melody happening.

And, on top of that, when something does happen, it's not really clear if it's melody or accompaniment.

Now, this might partly be Musescore playback, but is your melody:

E-F-E - G-F-D- E -  - D - G - C -  - 

and if so, then why aren't those notes in the RH where they can be more easily played at a different dynamic. Even if they're not meant to be melodic (which also means it goes on too long with nothing happening), they should still be in the RH just to make performance more logical.

When what does appear to be a melody finally appears at m. 17, it's confused.

Is it C - B - E - F - G - G, or is it the upbeat chords in 17 and 18, like G - G-F - E - F - G - G

The 2nd one makes the G-F move far more naturally to E than the the B would if it were the other way around.

One thing to consider is, is that C and B that doubles the bass note even really truly necessary - it's just confusing things.

At 33 we get another long passage of "just accompaniment" preceded by 4 measures of basically, just accompaniment, that had something before that that was very cool (the chromatic descent) but otherwise is still basically just accompaniment.

You have this other places, but at 70 you've got this G/Bb chord with a C on top. Right before it is this Fmaj9 with a Bb then D. They're both a little funky - a m9 interval between the A and Bb in the first of the two, and then the Bb against C.

But here's the kicker - m. 71 has no 3rd on the downbeat.

You have these very "dense" harmonies, then all of the sudden, for no apparent reason, you have this "empty" <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

I would say as a general rule, your harmonies are "too dense", or, rather, there's no consistency or logic to their density. It makes the texture seem very plodding and "banging on the piano" in many ways, and it's also especially muddy when you've got dyads on the beat that are low to begin with, then add this stacked chord on top - and almost all of them are pretty much close voicing, making them all the more "dense". When the RH is playing chords too, it just becomes this really dense texture.

Then you can't hear the nuances of what any inner parts are doing, or again, it confuses the melody.

You don't have to "stack 3rds" all the time - it's almost like if you want a 9th chord you feel like you have to use R-3-5-7-9.

If you just scan through, everything on beat 2 and/or 3 in the LH is eitehr a close triad, traid with its bottom note doubled on top, a 7th chord, and sometimes a 1st or 2nd inversion like structure and rarely an inverted 7th like structure (which adds a 2nd in there no less!).

I think that's fine for a certain effect, but it just becomes plodding throughout an entire piece (or movement). And again, combining this with what are essentially full RH triads only makes it that much more dense.

Fine for effect, but really, a change in texture would be most welcome - about all you have is not having the RH play or once in a while, not having the LH play.

It's going to take a superhuman or person with 6 fingers on the RH to play the last chord.

Many of the RH parts in the 2nd movement are just unplayable.

m13. is a great example of what I was talking before - there it makes perfect sense when these accented "crushes" are on beat 2 - great effect.

The quadruplet though just seems so out of place (it's also notated wrong but that may be a Musescore issue - same thing with the nonuplet later, it should just be 3 triplets - and I know musescore can do that).

Honestly, what it looks (and sounds) like is, you don't know how to make transitions, and you kind of patchworked ideas together, and then connected them with these random things like quadruplets or nonuplets.

Both show a little obvious inspiration from Satie's Gymnopedies, especially the opening of the 2nd one.

There are IMHO some nicer moments in the 2nd movement, and overall there's a clearer delineation of melody and accompaniment, and a little more textural .

You've got tons of notational issues throughout, many of which are obscuring your musical intentions. Some of these may be something musecore can't do but I know some of them are things it can and you didn't do them right. Also, there are tons of wrong accidentals. These again can obscure your musical intent.

I just saw the passage from 85 - 108 - holy cow, nothing going on for a long time.

Those little melodic bits - again, if they're supposed to be "points of interest" they need to be singled out from the accompaniment in some way, and putting them in the RH would be highly informative to the player that they were a separate thing, and a different dynamic would also help if that's the case. If that's not the case, then again, this is an awful long stretch of nothing really happening.

Sorry to be so negative. I mean, there are certainly nice moments and nice ideas in here but the problem is, it's kind of so dense and in a way "a jumbled up mess" (harmonically, notationally, formally, texturally, etc.) that those nice moments are getting covered up by what really seems like superfluous notes.

Go through and ask yourself, "does this note really need to be here?"

Could this chord C-E - E-G-B-D be "pruned" to just C on beat 1, then E-B-D on beat 2.

Or better, would C on beat 1, then B-D-E give you more the effect you wanted.

And given those unplayable chords in the RH in the 2nd movement, that really goes to show that some pruning is necessary - I mean, can you play this? More importantly, do you want other people to play it? If so, it's always wiser to make it playable to as much of the population as possible, not just those with monster hands.

Again sorry to point out everything like there's just all mistakes - but there are a lot of things that are in fact mistakes, and other things that you could probably change to express your musical ideas more efficiently.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Function is a "role" that chords can play.

There are "typical" chords that usually take on typical roles though.

V and vii^ both have a Dominant Function, in both Major and Minor keys.

The Subdominant Function (or, Pre-Dominant Function, or Dominant-Prep Function) is taken by IV and ii typically (iv and ii^o in minor keys).

The Tonic function is the I chord (or i in minor).

Some places teach that iii and vi (and I believe, III and VI in minor) also have Tonic function and this is also generally accepted in Jazz circles as well, but for different reasons. iii acts like an extension of I turning it into a Imaj7 chord, which in Jazz is considered a stable Tonic chord as the 7th chord is sort of the "base harmonic unit". vi works similarly, creating a sort of I6 sound - also a stable tonic in jazz.

However, in classical <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and much of what most people learn, iii and vi (and III and VI in minor) usually have "variable" function, or are described as "Mediant" function, which has no real meaning.

Most of the time in traditional classical <b><u>harmony</u></b>, iii and vi function as "pre-pre-dominants" if you like.

I - iii - IV - V is a common progression. Some see iii as a "prolongation" of I, while others see it as "preparing the IV". Likewise, I - iv - IV - V, a very common progression, vi is often considered a prolongation of I, but it to takes on the "pre-pre-dominant" role (that's not a real function, I'm just using that to describe how it typically is used). It's also commonly used to move to ii, as in I - vi - ii - V.

Also, iii can appear like I - iii - vi - ii - V which is essentially a "cycle of 4ths progression". Again iii and vi can be seen (and I believe are by some) as prolongations of the I <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but a lot of people see it as sort of this grey area where you're moving both away from I but starting a movement towards it via a pre-pre-pre-dominant to pre-pre-dominant to pre-dominant to dominant to tonic :-)

One of the reasons people call it "variable" is because there is this grey area where it acts as a transition away from the Tonic but also creating a cycle that moves back towards it. Also though, in a Deceptive Cadence, which is V - vi (or V - VI in minor) the 6 chord is "taking on the role of the Tonic" but it's not "the" Tonic if you like.

It's a "substitute" for the Tonic.

Let's say iii and vi are like Tom Hanks. He can pretty much play any role. But if you've ever seen that meme about the guy who plays "Hector" in tons of movies - he's like always cast as the stereotype mexican gang member - that's more like V where it's most often a Dominant function chord.

_______

Now the substitution thing brings up an interesting issue that is not really discussed a lot TMK.

Let's say a piece consists of nothing but I and iii.

Well, is the iii then a "Dominant" chord? Has it "taken on the role" of Dominant - which is what would naturally alternate with the Tonic?

Or what about a piece in Mixolydian that only used I and v (minor v). Is that minor v a Dominant function chord? Or, is it allowed to assume that role?

Or what about a modal vamp in Dorian that goes i - IV the whole tune. Is that really Tonic and Subdominant (Pre-Dominant)? Is the IV taking on the role of Dominant, or is having a "functional progression" of just Pre-Dominant to Tonic "OK"?

Or, is there a limit to Functional progressions where we have to allow the Roles to exist and be filled by whoever's available for the part - bad casting or not - or do we need any more movies with the Hollywood stereotypes?

IOW, don't get too hung up on Functional progressions and which chords function as which. It's fine for talking about classical music where it was a big deal, but for modern popular music, it's just not functional in the same way, nor does it matter, or at best it's exhibiting a new type of functionality that traditional terms and concepts either don't apply to or need to be modified in order to be of any real value.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Start with Sabbath. Priest and Iron Maiden are great too. Learn as much as you can of all of their songs. You need to learn hundreds of songs (or at least significant parts of songs) to be able to effectively create your own in the same style. 

Pink Floyd is great for learning how to solo because Dave Gilmour is the tastiest player on the planet but also plays relatively simple stuff that's not too technical and easy to get into your ear and also to understand from a melody/<b><u>harmony</u></b> standpoint. Dime is a little tougher!

But I would kind of concentrate on that earlier stuff that led up to Pantera and LOG or or other bands like Metallica and Megadeth even. Those guys all learned from playing Sabbath riffs.

Heading out to the Highway is a good one as is You've Got Another Thing Coming.

What's funny is a lot of those early guys learned from Hank Marvin of The Shadows (and a lot of guitarists in the US did the same thing with The Ventures). Gilmour credits his "melodicity" in playing partially to Hank Marvin being an influence.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Sure.

Plenty of pieces are in only one key - a lot of pop songs are.

Now, in Common Practice Period music, it's pretty much assumed that a Piece "in C" is also going to modulate to at least one other key, then back - often G, or Am, then back to C. But we still consider the *piece* to be in C, with just a section in G etc.

This also happens in pop music a lot - the verses will be in Em, while the choruses are in G.

But much music also has chromatic notes as well.

Usually what happens is, it's difficult to sustain interest for too long just using a single Key and the notes and chords from it for melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

It's not impossible of course but generally speaking, in most music you're going to find either at least chromatic notes, notes from other keys/modes, or chromatic chords and chords from other keys/modes, if not a full fledged modulation to a different key.

But I would say "writing something in an easy key just to transpose it later" is being lazy and doing it for the wrong reason.

If you write good music in C, it's not going to make it any "better" to transpose it to D or F etc. Might as well just leave it in C and compose everything that way. Of course it might be seen as a person who only writes one style of books, like cheesy romance novels - you might do one thing well, but it's the only thing you can do well. Sometimes that's OK and fine for people, but if you want to do other things, it helps to just bite the bullet and learn how to do them.


Just pick another key and try it. It's not that hard. You want to compose in G? Just make all the F notes F# instead. Then do the same basic thing you would have done in C, but now in G.

What would really really really help is learning to play songs in various keys.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It works the same way it does in Major:

Pre-Dominant chords lead to Dominant chords, which lead to Tonic chords.

And in both modes (meaning major and minor in this context) the chords that play those roles are the same, with one exception:

The Dominant Function chords in Minor Keys are altered so they are the same structure as the chords in the Major mode would be.

For example, the Dominant Function chords in C **Major** are G and B^o .

In C **Minor** those chords would "natively" be Gm and Bb, but we alter them to be G Major and B^o .

We do this by raising Scale Degree 7 one half step in Minor Keys on Dominant Function chords.

The reason for this is, if we don't the Minor mode has a tendency to "drift towards major".

That's because if you imagine being in A Minor and have the chord progression of VII to III, it's going to be G - C - which sounds exactly like V-I in C Major!

So that VII (or bVII if you like) leads so strongly to C - which is III (bIII) but that's NOT the Tonic chord - meaning one of the chords that is the position to be Dominant Function doesn't want to go to the Tonic, it wants to go to some non-tonic chord (in this style and this way of thinking, III is not a Tonic chord, despite what they say in Jazz).

So composers altered the VII chord to be vii^o so it would lead to the Minor Tonic just like it did in Major, by taking on a Dominant Function.

So G#^o - Am would be a Dominant to Tonic move. Likewise, Em is changed to E (major) so it too works just like it would in A Major - again taking on Dominant Function.

This chart is pretty much how chord function works in Major Keys in Common Practice Period music:

https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2675ac0a1e1b33acc4738942589d5ed9-c

As you can see here:

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qXBGBKAdgTk/UHq0Q90WrwI/AAAAAAAAABs/SFnRbhH4iZA/s400/ccp.TIF

Minor is pretty much the same. V and vii^o in the last bracket before i are not "native" to minor, but are altered to take on Dominant function.

Notice that v (minor v) doesn't appear anywhere, while VII (bVII) is way out on the left 

The arrows on this chart aren't great - they only show what happens in sequential progressions but if you look at the first chart, the minor version has the chords laid out like the 2nd link, but the arrows for the first link.

So really, minor doesn't differ all that much from major at all - in fact, we changed minor so it would work more like major!

There are a couple of common exceptions in Minor that don't happen in major and these tend to involve "non dominant" V and bVII chords. But we don't consider those "functional" anyway.

If you want to dig deeper, here's an excellent video series:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eF8-8wzCmA

Now one thing that's VERY important here is that Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is really part of Common Practice Period Style - notice Dr. Monahan's videos actually talk even more specifically about the Classical Style (which is within the CPP).

Modern popular music isn't always Functional at all. Nor is music prior to the CPP nor a lot of music after it.

There are pieces of music that are "descended" from the CPP style that do follow **some** of its principles and Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> can be one of those principles.

But even though he's talking about a particular style he says something very important in the video - that you need to LISTEN TO (and learn to play) lots of (in his case, Classical) music to understand what is common and what is not.

If you're interested in writing modern pop music for example, you need to listen to and learn to play modern pop music and forget about Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. Yes, again, some pieces might have chord progressions that do in fact follow functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> - but generally they do so because someone liked the sound of those progressions (because they **heard** them somewhere before) rather than saying, "oh crap, this is a Pre-Dominant chord, so I MUST now go to a Dominant chord".

As Monahan even mentions (and attempts to reinforce) that's not even true of the music where functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> was a big deal!

It's even less of a big deal now. Not even a big deal at all.

But if you're taking a Theory course that focuses on CPP <b><u>harmony</u></b>, this video series would be really helpful in getting a deeper understanding of elements of that style.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Your A# should be Bb.

Your roman numeral position numbers should be over the 2nd note of the measure, not the D, unless the D is marked Open - that D note is the 10th fret of the 6th string so could be played there!

Honestly, at this tempo, it's kind of boring - I like that it's a Rondo but you don't really have a "real" Rondo in that the opening of each section is just the same.

This is very much like those beginner Carcassi and Carulli Preludes/Etudes which basically picks an arpeggio pattern and goes through chord changes.

Nothing wrong with that but usually those are shorter and just more a "study" than anything. Some of them even give alternate arpeggio patterns for practice - they're kind of "utilitarian" and "pedagogic" pieces in that regard.

It's very repetitive. The constant open D against the accented high note gets a little - almost comical. The accent is not really necessary. It's going to stand out by virtue of its register.

Once you get to this length you either need some more obvious variation or at least some change of tonal center with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - and not over a D drone the whole time :-)

Some interest in the bass line would really shake things up.

What if the drone note was the low D in the A section, then a middle string in the B section, then the high string in the C section, and so on?

That would liven things up a little without having to make that much of a drastically different piece - or, what I would suggest is that something like that be your next piece like this - It looks like you have the basic skills to do it, so shouldn't be too much more difficult but the result would probably be a lot more interesting.

I get that it's a "Simple Prelude" and nothing wrong with that - could be made for beginners (though the position shifts make it suddenly get slightly more advanced) but I think that's about all it's going to appeal to. Again, nothing wrong with that, but since you said you were planning 12 pieces in the set, that's a pretty big undertaking. I don't know that I would want to spend the time writing 12 pieces of which this was the first if they were all like this.

IOW, I would just write some stand alone pieces without any concern about putting them in a group or a set, or a specfic number. Just keep writing more and more like this and then maybe thing, "I like very happy with these 6, I'll put them in a set together" or something like that - kind of like how Baroque Dance Suites had variable movements and people would plop in and take out movements at will in live performance.

You could absolutely have "12 Simple Pieces for Guitar" but I wouldn't be too concerned about locking yourself into any kind of amount or order until you have a number of pieces that seem to go together - you don't want a "Simple Suite" and then have 2 or 3 of the pieces be dastardly difficult compared to the others!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Chromatic notes typically arise for 4 basic reasons:

1. They embellish a diatonic note. For example, in moving from F to G a composer might want to "fill in" that interval with an F# just to "link" those notes. In this case they are generally not harmonic tones, but they could be (as in, embellishing chords where part or the whole chord is non-diatonic).

2. They are a "functional" note that's part of a Secondary Function, so that F# above could be part of a V7/V chord in the key of C, a chord that would typically resolve to G, so this F# becomes like the Leading Tone in the key of G. These are typically harmonic tones (but could be embellished themselves with other non-harmonic chromatic notes, or an instance could arise where a single chromatic note could imply a <b><u>harmony</u></b> like a Secondary Dominant).

3. They are examples of Mode Mixture - borrowing from the Parallel mode. In CPP music this would be borrowing between the Major and Minor and minor mode, so in the key of C Major, we might get an Ab that is borrowed from C minor. It could be harmonic or not. In modern music, this principle is extended to other Parallel modes as well, and an F# might be seen as coming from C Lydian rather than any of the other above types. The b2 is a special case because it appeared in CPP music in conjunction with the Neapolitan Chord, so today we consider it "borrowed" from Phrygian, but in some ways it's more or less used for its sound.

4. They can be just used for their sound. Most of this would apply more to Jazz with altered tensions that don't fit any of the above types, that are done because they imply a voice-leading approach to another note or chord, or just make an interesting "color chord". We could say in many cases that these are "justified" by being part of some "named scale" when they appear as single notes, so they could be non harmonic notes, but are usually subsumed into the <b><u>harmony</u></b> at hand and considered a harmonic tone.

________

A composer might write a line that is essentially this:

D - F# - A - D

and may decide they want to embellish each note with a lower note.

So the first is:

D-C#-D - a half step down. It's diatonic of course.

But when you get to the F#, does it go F#-E-F#, or F#-E#-F#?

Well, the composer may decide they like the sound of the half step in all of them, so it sounds consistent, so it ends up going:

D-C#-D - F#-E#F# - A-G#-A - D

It does ultimately depend on the sound you want but you have to understand that in certain styles there were "common moves" that over time just became more and more common - so they "work" because we've heard them a zillion times.

But in some cases, the first one could have just been a missed finger on a keyboard - a happy accident as our good friend Bob Ross would say. The composer liked it - figured it would make his teachers red in the face, and did it just to spite them!

But after a while, that sounds good, so yes, composers after that would have plenty of music where that move was common and "sounded good" and "worked" that they'd use it too.

What that means though is "sounds good" needs to be informed by familiarity with the style.

For example, we today might think a b5 blue note "sounds good" because we've heard it a zillion times. But Mozart &amp; co. would think it was a mistake. 

Learn to play tons of music and pay attention to how chromatic notes are used - you don't have to "define" them or put them in one of those categories I put above but after playing enough of them you'll kind of begin to intuit when it's right to use one fand how to use them for a given style.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It is Csus4.

Not "Csus" or just "sus".

Csus4.

That is, assuming it's in a context where C is the Root. However that is what is typically implied when it's written in this order.

If the root were F, it would be Fsus2.

And that's why you can't just call a "sus" chord "Csus" because "sus" could be either Sus2 or Sus4:

C-D-G  = Csus2

C-F-G = Csus4

then:

C-F-G = Csus4 (assuming C is the root).

F-G-C = Fsus2 (assuming F is the root).

G-C-F would be G7sus4 (assuming G is the root).

*In Jazz* "sus" by itself is used to imply "sus4" but you don't know who's going to be reading your music so you need to specify sus2 or sus4 - not all musicians play jazz. Also in jazz it's assumed that the 7th chord is the "base unit" of <b><u>harmony</u></b> so "Csus" typically is used as "shorthand" for C7sus4, which is the more correct symbol.

But C-F-G, yes, Csus4 is the correct name.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Umm. We've pretty much already done everything in here already.

I particularly like the "you can't play it backwards".

Yes, that's because functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> *progresses* towards a goal.

And most of this stuff is not going to be unique to Beethoven.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's called "**Twentieth** Century <b><u>Harmony</u></b>".

Not "Eighteenth Century <b><u>Harmony</u></b>".

Persichetti could be said to be encouraging budding composers to write music that sounds "modern" (at the time of writing) rather than 200 years old and the information and exercises are geared towards that.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The notes are NOT what you listed for A Major Pentatonic.


The notes are, in presented in an order that orients the Key Note or "Tonic" to the name of the scale, A, is:

A - B - C# - E - F# - (A)

We don't list an "A" scale starting on any other note than A. That's because the listing starting on the Key Note is meant to show that this is the Key Note or Tonic and that that note should in some way be musically emphasized (or rather, is musically emphasized in practice which is why we list it this way).

You can't just play scales without any context.

There are 7 modes which all have the same notes. Aside from musically emphasizing one by starting and maybe ending on it, or making it the highest and lowest note of the scale you play, they are all the same notes. So the only way to tell the difference between each of these 7 modes is to add <b><u>HARMONY</u></b> to it so the <b><u>harmony</u></b> will "orient" our ears or "focus" our brains on a single Tonic Chord.

Play A - Bm - D - A in repetition and play A Major Pentatonic over it.

Here's an example:

https://musescore.com/user/32723609/scores/5664960

In the first half I have those chords, with notes from A Major Pentatonic over it. Notice hour the A note at the beginning of each measure as well as at the end of the phrase.

In the second half I have those same chords with notes from the scale you listed. Starting on B, De-emphasizing the A by not playing it, or putting it not on the beat, and after or surrounded by A#.

Some people may like it, but most are going to find it "sounds wrong" - and not in a good way or intentionally so!

Now if the chords were Bm - F# - Bm - F# - F# - C#m - F# - Bm it would sound OK.

But you would not be playing A Pentatonic Major then.

And your A# takes it out of A Major Pentatonic.

The reason it sounds like B is, the A# acts like a leading tone to B, a familiar sound from the key of B Minor, and you've listed it as starting on B, and may be even playing it that way - emphasing the B by starting and stopping on it, and you don't seem to have any chords you're playing it over that would otherwise orient your ear away from B, but towards A, and not to mention that you can't just add a note to the scale as it makes it a different scale.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, the best thing you will ever do for yourself is stop "using scales".

Music is made of melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

The notes for the melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> generally come from the KEY.

A scale is just a "listing" of notes - traditionally from the Key, but again they're sort of "cheats" or "hacks" to give you a certain note set.

Instead, it's better to look at melodic notes as whether they're chord tones or not first, and then if they have any special function second.

Another way you might look at this is "you always play the chromatic scale, and just concentrate on notes you want, and avoid the notes you don't"!

It's of course a rather broad way to look at it but in effect, that's what we actually do.

C7 - chord tones - C-E-G-Bb

C7 - diatonic non chord tones - D-F-A

C7 - blue notes - Bb (already a chord tone), Eb, and Gb.

C7 - Chromatic non chord tones, C#, G# and to a large degree, the B, though diatonic to the Key, is not a chord tone because we are really in what is essentially "C Mixolydian" so it tends to get used more like a chromatic non chord tone.

You can also see the D and the A as common "extensions" to the C7 chord, making C6, C9, or C13 which are all common "blues" chords - the 13 being "a little more jazzy".

Now, there are two strategies when you change chords. One is simply to "Transpose" everything I just said up to F for the F7 chord.

But some people take a "key" approach, staying in the key (C Mixolydian) and making adjustments as necessary. While you could take this and say it is a "different scale" again that's not necessarily the best way to think of it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcdQk7JBPzQ

While not specifically a 12 bar, this song takes the main melody (no <b><u>harmony</u></b> at first, but implies the I7 chord) and just transposes it up to IV7.

Super common.

But a lot of players will also just "stay in the main scale" and simply avoid notes they don't want on a given chord - again, this may produce another "nameable scale" but it's kind of an oversimplified way of looking at it.

Except:

I'd say certainly some people have used the "scale" method and it's worth understanding so you can more easily mimic what they do.

So one strategy is to pick a scale, like Mixolydian, and just transpose it.

But another strategy is to play C Mixolydian over the I7 chord, and C Dorian over the IV7 chord (C Dorian is, BTW, F Mixolydian, so in a sens you do "transpose", but the way people conceptualize it is by remaining "on C").

And yet another strategy is to do something like eliminate enough notes that whatever single scale you pick "works" over all the chords. Which is usually minor pentatonic (or minor blues, which is minor pentatonic with the added b5 usually)

So, for a Blues in C, you could:

1. Play C Pentatonic Minor (Blues) over the whole thing. Rarely will someone play C Pentatonic MAJOR over a blues progression, but one song called "Hideaway" by Freddie King uses the Major Pentatonic over most of the progression before finally getting to the b7 blues note and basically.

2. Play C Pentatonic Major over the I7 chord, and C Pentatonic Minor over the IV7 chord, or the reverse (the reverse happens in "One Way Out" by The Almann Brothers). You could also play Pent Major over the V chord (assuming if you're playing minor over the rest of the progression you're doing #1 above).

3. Pentatonic scales are just "subsets" of Major and Minor, or more appropriately, Mixolydian and Dorian, or "The Composite Blues Scale" if you like. They can be intermixed on a single chord. For example, you may often hear a Pentatonic-like form that gives you 5-6-1-2-b3 or similar. So it's "dorian" if we like, but one might also say it's combining the 6 from Major pent with the b3 of minor pent. Same thing with the classic Mixolydian "boogie bass" figure 1-3-5-6-b7 which sort of has 3 from Major pent, and b7 from minor pent (and this is almost a rotation and thus a transposition of the "dorian" one - see how they keep coming together).

4. You can use other "subsets" including "hexatonic scales" and other pentatonic scales that give you note conent you may want, but are not the typical choices. For example, F Major Penatonic will give you "good" notes in C - it's got 4-5-6-1-2 - so you're just using 4 instead of 3 in this scale. But players will sometimes do this to "restrict" their note choices to a particular set.

5. You can "mix and match" between all these methods.

Most players kind of look down on the first method - it's something guitarists learn to do, and have done a lot, but we might call it the "British White Boy Blues Scale" because a lot of the people in the "Blues revival" in the 1960s (on the heels of the British Invasion) were trying to play "bluesy rock" and didn't really "get" the whole idea of intermixing the b3 and 3, and using 6 from major - so they "simplified" it and just went off on Pentatonic Minor.

A lot of players would see this as an "uninformed" way to play "pure" Blues and especially Jazz Blues (the more informed way understanding how b3 and 3 work within the note set, and the use of 6 and b7).

A lot or Rock players made up for this by figuring out how to intermix the scales - like #2 above - they used minor to get those blue notes, but used major over the I7 chord for example. By choosing major, they could have what equates to a 6/9 chord without the b7. By using minor, they get the b3 and b7, all of which can be transposeable. So doing that go them closer to the more traditional "informed" sound.

But, if you want to "think scales" and use that approach, it's kind of an easier thing to grasp at first than trying to remember which notes function as what where.

The drawback is, you run the danger of just "running scales" or always thinking "this scale over this chord" - which has precedents so can be useful, but is not "really" the way most people actually approached it.

So it really really helps to work out MELODY rather than just "improv-ing with scales" - your playing will be much better in the long run.

Good Luck.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Phew. So many comments and no ones talking about the chords.

When you play music, don't play "scales". Play NOTES, and make melodies and harmonies from those notes.

In doing so, you may even make a "Tonality" by playing *certain* notes and focusing on them.

When you make a <b><u>Harmony</u></b> from a given set of notes, say, an Am chord, any notes you improvise can be in agreement with that <b><u>harmony</u></b> or not.

When you play a chord progression, or a riff that uses notes from a "Key" (a single tonality) you put a focus on the notes to make it some notes "fit" with the chord even though they're not part of the chord, and other notes are more remote.

Now, when we talk about a "Key" - the notes in a key are what we call a "Scale" - they're a "listing" if you like of the notes in a Key in ascending order (like climbing a wall, or "scaling" a wall!) and we list the "Key Note" as the first note.

This is why C Major and A minor can have the same notes, but they represent two different KEYS. (and yes, we could also say and most of the time do that they're two different scales).

When the bass player plays "in A Minor" they're using notes from the key of Am, and probably focusing on notes that create either a really strong sense of "Key Note" or notes that imply a chord progression that also creates a strong sense of "Key Note" - so we know what the key is.

I mean, think of it this way - if you want to play in Am, and all you do is play D notes, it's probably not going to sound very much like Am!!!!!

So you FOCUS on notes from Am, and more specifically, an Am chord or even just the A in some cases.

The person improvising then plays notes "from the key of Am" (or we could say, from the Am scale, which is what most people say).

But, they can also focus on notes of any given chord at any given time. So if the other bassist plays something that implies an Am chord, then something that implies a G chord, and alternates between the two, the improvising bass player (or other musician) can then focus exclusively or primarily on the notes of each chord, or, since those two chords give you 6 notes out of the whole scale (Key) they can play the scale, or a six note segment of the scale, and probably none of the notes will sound too bad.

Now just because the notes they're playing are also in C doesn't mean our ears get oriented to C - they would if the accompanying bass player starting playing riffs that focus exclusively or primarily on the KEY of C - doing that sets up a "tonality" of C - and no matter what the improvser plays, it's going to sound like C.

Because the "person with the power" if you like is the person who is most strongly implying <b><u>HARMONY</u></b> and by extension a particular TONALITY - and usually we design one part to do just that - it's typically the accompaniment, and we use things like well-known chord progressions and lower bass notes to really make the <b><u>harmony</u></b> obvious and if the person improvising tries to play the "wrong" scale, we're going to hear it from the reference point of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (or key), not from the "scale the improviser is playing" standpoint.

Yes, but that grasp comes not from "studying grammar" in any formal sense, but having intuited it from simply learning the language and having encountered poetry often enough to cull from it what separates it from "prose" - and we can even say - this is a great example - poetry often IGNORES "grammatical rules" doesn't it?

Words, in prose, are just gibberish when grammar is thrown too far to the wind.

But in poetry, there's probably a little more "artistic freedom" to be more gibberishy!

I think the toolset you need is not publications, but pieces of music that exploit the very things you're talking about. Of course, ideally if there was something that explained them as well that would be great.

I suppose the issue is, there isn't really any consistent precedent for "timbral" music - in fact I always mention to my class that timbre is sort of the last great unexplored territory in music composition (of the sort of "basic elements of sound" - we indicate pitch, we indicate volume, we indicate duration, but we don't indicate timbre outside of a few things like mutes, etc.)

There are people experimenting with it more since the dawn of the 20th century (and we could argue that all the filter sweeps in modern EDM are sort of a focus on a timbral element) but there aren't any "relationships" between timbres - yet. They're still being written if you like.

You said in your other post you had done a little bit of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Are you asking about pitch in relationship to established hierarchical relationships within a Key?



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, I'm going to be mean to you in an attempt to help you "see the light" and hopefully remember it forever :-) !!!!! Read through please:

Why is it important for you to know the Key?

"So it's easier for me to write mel...HOLD IT RIGHT THERE YOU (name calling starts here for emphasis) YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.

WHY THE (expletives shouted here) WOULD YOU **NOT USE A KEY** TO MAKE YOUR **CHORDS** BUT THEN TRY TO USE ONE FOR YOUR MELODY??????????

**IT'S JUST COMPLETELY AS (insert words here with lots of powerful impact that mean "stupid as stupid can be") AS IT CAN POSSIBLY BE!!!!!!!!

OK, dude, friend, fellow music maker, look, if you don't draw your chords from a single key, then your melody can't come from a single key.

If you want your MELODY to come from a single key then you have to draw your chords from that key as well. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE STARTING WITH CHORDS.

___________

Now, I said you're doing it wrong, but you're not really, you're just missing something very basic that a lot of people seem to be missing (which is quickly becoming one of my biggest pet peeves and I don't understand why people don't learn this). I saw a post from someone a couple days back that was like "I've been playing 2 years and just learned the importance of using BOTH your chords and melody noes from the SAME key  - I'm like No S Sherlock, that's what you should have learned on day 1 - you've wasted 2 years of your life!

I don't want you to waste any more of your time!!!!

Music doesn't have to be all from the same key.

But, Melody and <b><u>Harmony</u></b> are not two different things that come from two different places.

So, let's start with music "In a Key".

When music is "In a Key" that means EVERYTHING - comes from the Key - BOTH the Melody AND the chords come from the key.

If you are going to write a Song in D Major, you don't just grab some random chords. You grab chords from the key of D Major.

Now you don't have to use ONLY chords from D Major, you can go out of key, but when you do, it means it's out of key, and any other notes that go with with may have to be out of key as well.

Dmaj9 - nice - it's in D. Asus2 - in D, good.

But you "can't make a CMaj9" from D Major because it doesn't have those notes in the KEY.

You can use that chord if you want (because it sounds good) but it's not in D. So you can no longer "Know the Key so I can make melodies".


So simply put, when you make chords, you need to draw them all from the same Key you're planning to draw your melody from as well. They both work together.

If you want to use "out of key" melody notes, you can, but if you do, the chord that goes with them may have to be out of key also. If your use "out of key" chords, you can, but if you do, the melody note that goes with it may have to be out of key also.

So what you need to get out of your head right now is this idea of "what key is this progression in so I can make melody notes".

That's not question 1.

Question 1 is: "is this progression in key to begin with?"

If not, Question 2 is: "are a majority, or number of chords from any particular key or keys and if so, what are they?"

So you need to learn to determine if a chord progression is in a key or not.

To do that, you have to know your keys.

D Major has C# in it - so the C chord can't be in D.

Bb is not in the key of D, so it can't be Bb.

C doesn't have the F# and C# that's part of the DMaj9 chord or the Bb so it can't be in the key of C.

You have to use process of elimination.

And then, when you figure out a chord is not in the Key, you take that on its own.

And then the easiest way to make a melody is to PLAY THE NOTES OF THE CHORD.

If you don't know what notes are in Dmaj9, then that's a problem. You need to learn that.

D-F#-A-C#-E or, in a somewhat scalar order, C#-D-E-F#-A. So all of those notes will work over the DMaj9 chord.

Will G or B work (the two that are missing). Dunno. Try them and see.

Cmaj9:

B-C-D-E-G - hey, that has the D and the E from the previous chord. Maybe the G and B won't sound so bad with the Dmaj9 chord since they're in this chord. But the C# from DMaj9 has to change to C. I'll try the F# and see if it still works.

And that's how you do it - on a case-by-case basis.

The chord tones will always work as melodic tones, but any that you don't have in the chord will depend on if they're in any over-riding key even if the chord is not part of it, or if they're in the previous or next chord, etc. It's all trial and error after that.

So basically, your chords and melodies should come from the key. When either goes out, the other may have to go out as well to accommodate.

If you don't know how to figure out whether something (like a chord progression) is in a given key, you need to learn to figure out how to do that because it's super important as all this demonstrates!

OK, hope that helps.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The name for what it is is a Dyad.

The name for what it produces is <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

Whether it's a "chord" or not depends on who you ask.

Most of the time, a Dyad is simply an incomplete chord. You may have heard that people commonly omit the 5th of the chord in Jazz on 7th chords and larger. C-E-Bb is an "incomplete" chord. It's missing the 5th. But the context is usually pretty clear that it implies C7 enough to the point it **is** a C7 <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

A Dyad of C up to E, at the end of a piece in the key of C Major, is most likely implying a C Major chord, rather than an Fmaj7 or something!

So we can say, it produces **<b><u>harmony</u></b>** that may also be an incomplete chord that implies that chord, by virtue of context.


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Hello, very nice.

Playable, though there are a few things that I would be mad at you about fingering-wise for such an otherwise simple piece :-)

Reminds me a lot of the early pieces in the Carcassi method.

I noticed in the 2nd measure, you did what would be a "no-no" in CPP music, which is parallel octaves between the B and A in the lowest voice in the last 8th note B to A in the upper voice.

And here's a funny thing - when I played it back, the bass note A seemed to totally disappear at that point!

That may be computer speakers, but the point is that that's one of the reasons just plain 8ves were avoided like that, and why parallel 8ves were avoided as well.

The reason they were avoided was because you have what is essentially "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" produced by 2 voices and then all of the sudden, bam, for one (or two) note(s) you get no <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

It sounds like one of the parts dropped out. And on my computer, one of them actually did drop out aurally speaking!!!

So you probably don't want that!

(note, I just glanced at the other response and they said the same thing - and honestly, I came up with it independently so that should tell you something - yes, it sounds like a "hole" in the texture).

You could easily fix that if you want to by using a C# in the melody there (then how you get to the D on the next downbeat will also have to be changed probably).

I'm not crazy about the 5th in the next measure, G and D - the next time you have a B there and maybe it would be better to have C# over the A chord and B over the G.

I realize you run into a string of parallel 10ths on beats 1 and 3 constantly but that was quite common for these types of pieces if you want to try it.

The Tonicization of the A at the end with the E major chord in measure 14 was a little shocking to me. I feel like you just put it in to see if you could do it - it comes of as more as an exercise in "fitting one in" rather than having any musical purpose. But on its own, it works OK.

Nice piece.

Actually, I want to say the harmonic and rhythmic "lack of variety" doesn't bother me too much as to me it sounds like a typical "divisions" kind of approach - you present your main idea one time through, and then do a "division" of it - smaller note values and more activity, without going crazy variety-wise.

I know of tons of little guitar pieces like that and this is essentially a really good emulation of that type of piece - so taking it on that kind of comparison, I would maybe just touch up some spots if I were you rather than trying to extend it or make it more complex or anything like that. Save that for the next piece ;-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The answer to your first sentence is, sometimes.

C - Am - F - G7 - assuming the music is one chord per measure, and it continually loops, and we can assume would probably end on a final C chord, is pretty safe to say is in C Major.

It *could* be something else but it's very doubtful and most people who say such things are just picking nits or being contrary or trying to mess with you and so on.

The second part of your question actually seems to be hitting on some other things, part of which is functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

I think you're thinking of this wrong.

While a "ii - V - I" in Major is a "i - IV - VII" in Dorian, we don't usually play that in Dorian because it will sound too much like Major!

It's the same reason we use ii - V - I in Major instead of ii - iii - vi. Think about it for a minute - what happens if you play Dm - Em - Am - is it going to sound very much like C Major? no, not at all. It's probably going to sound like A Aeolian instead.

So what we typically do is use progressions that "point to I" if you like. II-V progressions are so popular because they point to I. In fact, they're such a powerful tonal progression, using just the II and V can even imply what the I is (or would be if it were present)!

And what makes that progression so "powerful" if you will is because it is UNIQUE to the Key - if you play Dm - G7 it kind of HAS to be C Major (sure, it could be Am, or F Lydian, but bear with me here).

So, if we want a Mode to sound like X mode, we have to "point to X", using chord progressions that do just that. However - here's the catch - we are SO indoctrinated to hear a progression like II - V as pointing to the traditional Minor or Major tonic, that it's almost impossible to "unhear" it.

So when we're dealing with modes, we usually go to great lengths to avoid any progressions that sound like they point to whatever the Major or Minor equivalent would be.

One way to do this is use what would be a II - V - I in that mode - so, Em - Am - Dm in D Dorian.

But you run into problems if you try - F - B^o - Em - because that just sounds like a Sequential progression in C Major. 

So we even have to avoid not only this Dm - G7 type progression, but anything else that sounds "too major" or "too minor" (except if we want like A Aeolian of course).

However, we can "thwart" the tendencies of some of these chord progressions in other ways.

For example, the typical Dorian vamp is i - IV(or i7 - IV9 etc.).

This would be Dm7 - G9 in D Dorian.

"But wait" you say, "that's just C Major again" - true, but again, bearing with me (and recalling that earlier comparison) by never getting to the C, and emphasizing the Dm through repetition, metric position, and so on we can sort of "force" it to be the I chord.

So, back to your initial question, if you put "what key is this" and put:

Dm7 - G7 - many people are going to say "C Major".

And it could be. But it could be D Dorian as well - it really must have the context in this case because these chords are really property of both Tonal and Modal domains.

This is actually a problem a lot of people who don't understand modes have - they see three chords - say, Dm, Cadd9, and G and go "that's C Major" because that's II, I, and V in C. But really, it's D Dorian if it's played like:

Dm - Cadd9 - G/B - Cadd9 and then loops back to the Dm.

But if it were: G - C - Dm - C it could be G Mixolydian.

The way the progression appears often implies a certain "center" - often the first chord - but it's not always like that.

F - Dm - Em - Am - what's that?

One error a lot of people make is they go "oh, that's C Major". No. If it has no C, it's not C Major. (it's not like the II-V that implies C because this progression is not "unique" in the same way).

It could be F Lydian, or E Phrygian, or A Aeolian, or D Dorian.

Also, all the common pop progressions can be hard:

Em - C - G - D

OK, you'd think Em because it's first, but the D sounds like it should resolve to G, and the G is right before it, and all these chords are in G, and so on.

And what makes ones like this worse is that very often, they may repeat this 4 times and then go into a chorus that the D moves on to G from there on out. So it's never really clear if it's G or Em.

So to Tl;DR back atcha:

Some progressions are unique enough, or common enough, to imply a key or really leave no question, aside from naysayers who want to play around.

Other progressions are more heavily reliant on context and in many cases what it "looks like" on paper isn't actually what it is.

Other progressions may have multiple interpretations, on paper and in song. Just ask someone what key Sweet Home Alabama is in.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Sort of - but as b8ck8tt said, there's more.

There's a LOT of confusion about modes out there.

Let's put it this way:

No matter what scale you play, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> can dictate how that scale is thought of.

You play notes from C Major, but the chords are clearly in Am, it's going to sound like the melody notes are Am, not C Major.

So the chords have the ability to "overpower" any scales you play usually (especially if the note content is the same).

But part of the issue here is the way you're thinking about it - you're presenting it like "lists" - the chords in C Major are - no, stop right there.

Sure, those chords are, but that's now how music is made.

Most music - in keys and modes at least - works by setting up a "center". And most of that time that is done through *specific* or *unique* chord progressions. And it's the way those chord progression are put together that, along with the melodic information, dictate the Key or Mode.

Likewise, melodies are not scales. Melodies shouldn't be just "running scales".

I don't know of many songs where the chords were in C Major and someone was just running up and down a C Major scale.

So "playing a C Major Scale over a Dm Chord" kind of makes no sense.

You can play the notes from the KEY of C Major as a melody over chords **from that same Key** and if those chords are "oriented" towards C as the Center (along with the melody as well) you're pretty much in C Major.

This idea of "playing D Dorian over Dm" or even "playing C over Dm because it makes it D Dorian" is very abstracted from actual music. It's not untrue, but it's not really how it works.

If you want Music in D Dorian, you draw your notes for your melody and your chords from the note/chord set in D Dorian! And of course you have to make melodies and progressions that "point to" D as the center rather than some other center those same notes could be in.

So it's kind of a "conceptual" distinction which leads to an aural one.

But I would encourage you to get out of the "C Major is D Dorian" kind of thinking - it is, but musically, we tread D Dorian as different from C Major as we do Am from C Major.

Side note: there are some uses for thinking "scales over chords" but I'm thinking that's not quite what you meant with your question.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>C-E-G

Db-F-Ab

E-G-Bb

F-Ab-C

G-Bb-Db

Ab-C-E

Bb-Db-F

Those are the harmonies drawn from the notes of the Phrygian Dominant scale on C.

You would draw notes for melody (which is "over" the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, usually, not <b><u>harmony</u></b> "over" the scale) from that same set of notes - C Db E F G Ab Bb C

But you can also use this scale over just a single <b><u>harmony</u></b>, rather than music using this scale for all it's note content.

The C7 chord in Fm could carry this scale (which is basically just F harmonic minor).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; Also, the way you phrased "added C on top" makes me suspicious that the C might be non-essential for <b><u>harmony</u></b> in your specific case, so that's worth considering.

That's a great point I forgot to consider! Yeah, check that out.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, if you're hearing it as part of the chord and not a melody note, then it is part of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and my first response would be valid again.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;I can't find a clear and concise answer to this question: If I'm playing over a modal progression (i.e. E Lydian mode), what is the key?

There isn't any Key. It's a Mode. They're two different things, or else we would have named them the same thing.

&gt;It either has to be key of E Lydian (which I've read it not really a key) 

Right, It's "The Mode of E Lydian".

&gt;Is it simply not a key and you'd just say playing in the E Lydian mode?

Yes.

However, let's talk about this:

The *way in which we use modes today* is very much like how we've used keys in the past.

So while E Lydian isn't really a "key" per se, we do treat it like that in the way we make music with it.

So a better concept is a "Center".

It's "in E".

Most people learn "It's in E Major" or "It's in E Minor".

But even for classical music, it's really better to think of it as, "It's in E, Major mode" or "It's in E, minor mode".

Here the word "mode" just means the type of scale.

But conceptualizing music that way is pretty much what we do with modes proper now.

"It's in E, Lydian Mode".

Which means, that the notes you draw BOTH your melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> from are:

E - F# - G# - A# - B - C# - D#  (E)

Those notes do happen to be the same notes as B Major, but it's not "in B" - the Center, is not B (and thus, it's not "in B Major" either). It by the way also happens to be the same notes as G# minor but no one ever suggests or asks about that one - why? Because we are so "major-centric" in our thinking. And even if you're not, most people are "major-minor-centric" at best. But really, E Lydian needs to be taken as its own thing, "Lydian Mode on a Center of E". And it has NOTHING to do with Major or minor - what it does have in common with those things - specifically E major or E minor is the CENTER - but not the "type"! Now, it's also the same notes as C# Dorian, D# Phrygian and so on.

But what makes it "E" is making musical elements that promote E as the Center, while keeping the modal flavor intact - meaning, don't do things that our Major/minor conditioning will make us hear as Major or Minor, and not Lydian. And conceptualizing this as "some sort of thing centered on B" will be counterproductive because it supposed to be "In E"!!!

And we so easily - being conditioned to be the major-centric beasts we are - will hear it as "B Major" rather than E Lydian.

So while modal music works "like a key used to" we can't do everything the same, and actually have to kind of go out of our way to make sure the center of E is maintained with this Lydian note set, do it doesn't "drift back" to what our major-conditioned brains will hear as B Major.

This means a "II-V-I" in E Lydian is possibly not going to be satisfactory in establishing the Center of E like you want. So modal music uses different tactics - and chord progressions - and melodic ideas - to help maintain the proper Center and Mode.

If you were to make a chord progression in E Lydian, say - E - F# - E - F# - and just vamp that over and over (and don't dare play a B chord because it will sound like it "finally" resolves to B) all you have to do is play notes from E Lydian over that set of chords and you've got a simplistic version of E Lydian.

Can you think "oh, will E Lydian is just the same thing as B Major, so I'll just play B Major"?

Sure.

But the problem there is, you're more likely to focus on the B note for your melodic playing and that may make your melodies "not as Lydian sounding" as you'd like.

Lydian BTW is the trickiest mode to deal with because it has more of a tendency to drift towards major (i.e. E Lydian being heard as B Major) than the other modes do. Probably one of the reason's it's less common overall than Mixolydian and Dorian, and to some degree, Phrygian.

So if you're just starting to work with these, you might want to try those others first, or at least try them along with the Lydian stuff.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Two different things;

Quartal Chords

Quartal *voicings* of Tertian Chords.

It's kind of hard to explain the difference without just experiencing them both, but in a piece that uses quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, the vast majority of the intervals will be 4ths and 5ths and there aren't any traditional chords. It' going to be such that calling C-F-Bb "C7sus4" makes no sense.

gravescd is right, Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is actually not really commonly used at all - it's a 20th century (for the most part) experimentalist <b><u>harmony</u></b> that appears in the music of Debussy, Ravel, and other 20th century composers, and people still use it today, as well as Secundal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but most of what people think is Quartal *<b><u>harmony</u></b>* is a mis-use of the term and what they're really seeing is a quartal *voicing* in an otherwise tertian context.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm not trying to talk down to you or anything, but how old are? How much music have you listened to in your life? Or how much music like this have you heard before?

I've heard tons. And this sounds like everything else. It's actually a direct rip-off of a lot of other songs. It's kind of a weird mixture (which I understand is becoming all the rage now) of rap/hip-hop production elements mixed in with what is essentially a "country" singer, with some tinges of gospel - the chord progression (especially that it's a piano-like sound) is very reminiscent of songs like "People Get Ready" which has been covered many a time. Here's just one version - different vibe, but the chord progression is similar:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdKEbnS1eBE

It's a curse as I get older because every time I hear a song now - especially ones that are full of "industry clichés" I'm like "that reminds me of..." or worse, I can actually sing the lyrics of an old song directly to a new song and the chord progression is often identical, the vocal melody very close, and the words have just been changed! No wonder so many artists are starting to get sued - they're blatant copies in some cases - might not have been intentional, but still....

I think for you, it may just sound unique - something you've not heard before, so it's "fresh". Otherwise, it could be something you've heard just once somewhere, but liked, but haven't thought about it or remembered it until you heard this and go "that sounds familiar, but I can't quite put my finger on it". Oh damn, I just said that having forgotten that you said the same thing in your post - see, that's a perfect example of how that stuff happens!

I'm not sure if it's the production or the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - neither or unique, but it could be that you've not heard the two used in this way at the same time, and that's what's catching you're ear. Hard to tell without having your same listening and life experiences.

Enjoy Curtis.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Could I be studying this a life time, and still not understand certain things?

Oh absolutely. But that's actually true with any field.

Music theory is a little like cooking.

You can get the "basics" of putting ingredients together and cooking with various methods and be able to produce meals you can survive on, and even ones that are darn tasty.

Baking is a little trickier because there are additional variables to consider and it's not only an additional skill set but some art to it. Most people could chop up ingredients and put into a salad, but not everyone can make pie crust from scratch.

Then you get into things like making your own salad dressings.

Then you get into peripheral fields and questions like "where did the idea of a pie crust originate, how did it evolve" - so that becomes a historical aspect. You can get into thermal reactions and how things cook, or why some things taste salty or sweet - that gets into science.

Now honestly, I think, at some point, if you get into "Music Psychology" for example, you can be beyond the bounds of what I'd call "Music Theory" but many people still consider those a part of it.

But even just "mainstream" theory - the "practical" and "objective" stuff is pretty vast and most people barely scratch the surface.

In fact, I'd say 90% of the people out there who are talking about "music theory" really just mean "music fundamentals" such as naming pitches, naming chords, knowing scales, and that sort of stuff. That really is "the basics" and IMHO while part of theory, is not the stuff you "study" per se - that's the stuff you should get just when learning an instrument.

Here's an example:

We have 4 semesters of Theory at my university.

Semester 1 begins with what is essentially a "review" of the fundamentals.

We give a placement test to incoming freshmen. It's rare for people who haven't studied elsewhere to pass out of it. At best, you'll get the talented guitarist who knows all of their notes, scales, and chords. Or maybe a pianist.

But where they get stuck is in Part Writing, and Analysis. They can often identify harmonies, but they don't know the analysis system, they don't know figured bass, they don't know part-writing.

So basically, have this brief review of "what you should have learned before you got to college" in the first couple of weeks, you get on to Analysis and Part Writing.

99% of the people online who "know theory" don't know how to Part Write. Very few know Figured Bass (though some have figured it out - pun intended :-D ).

And that's just Semester 1. In fact, that's the thing that keeps you from getting out of semester 1 and into semester 2 - and there's a total of 4 semesters!

Now, there are certainly elements discussed in the upper levels that people are often familiar with, such as Secondary Dominants or Borrowed Chords, but they still don't know how to Part Write, they usually never know how Non Chord Tones work (because they learned stuff online mostly from a Jazz perspective), often don't understand Modulation, and so on.

Then you get into things like Form.

In fact, our university has 4 semesters of Theory - some who don't have the skills will also take a "Theory 0" which is "Fundamentals of Music" before they're cleared to get into Theory 1, and then after Theory 4, you take Form and Analysis, and Counterpoint, which are also generally "theory" based.

Those who go on to study more in grad school typically expand that "base" theory of the Common Practice Period with either Early Music theory, or Post Tonal theory (or both). Post-Tonal theory alone can involve as much time as all of the other stuff.

Then there's the whole "practical application" side of Theory, which is "using it to improvise" or "using it to compose" which isn't necessarily any more information than the core stuff, but implementing it in a way beyond what is done in coursework typically.

Then you can take it in all kinds of directions - like there are those who study the impact of Folk music on a certain composer's output. People spend their lives on Chopin and the Mazurka.

So it's really usually a question of specializing further and further as you go further and further into it.

If you take a look at a standard university level theory text, such as Kosta and Payne's "Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" and look at the table of contents, you'll see the chapter headings.

Most people don't know the difference between Simple and Compound Meter. I think that's chapter 2. They might know some stuff from chapter 3, and maybe something from Chapter 7. But they skipped a lot of stuff along the way...
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>My pet peeve: Please don't assign your own Opus numbers.

Opus numbers are assigned by Publishers, especially in the time period you are emulating here.

One more suggestion: m. 7 beat 2, your Cx and E in the RH melody follow in the accompaniment figure and it sounds like the <b><u>harmony</u></b> drops out or you have parallel octaves - it's not really something you typically hear - those 2 octaves kind of stick out like sore thumbs (compare to how you begin the piece, with that nice D# completing a chord over the B F# figure - if you had a B or F# melody there it wouldn't sound as full a chord).

Usually a composer might reverse something - so you get parallel 3rds or 6ths instead of 8ves, or just intervals of those kinds rather than 8ves parallel or not.



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So I change the chord for every one of these notes?

Yes and no. 

Bach Chorales are written with 4 independent parts, not "chords". They come together to form a chord but really, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is "a result of" the way the 4 voices interact.

Rather than "write chords to your melody", you should be thinking about "writing a line that harmonizes with the melody".

That's why that it "harmonizing a melody" in Chorale style writing, not just generating an accompaniment like you do in Homophonic writing.

&gt;That would be like playing the whole thing as a drop 2 voicing or something of the kind?

Not really. Might be drop 2 for one chord, but it'll be different for other chords, and everything doesn't move in parallel like a lot of jazz harmonization ("Chord-Melody style")

&gt;If I just put the melody on the top and change the bass, tenor and alt whenever the <b><u>harmony</u></b> changes, then it doesnt really feel like a chorale anymore. Then it would be like playing it on the piano very simply (right hand melody and in the left hand changing the chord every bar or twice in a bar). 

Exactly. You're producing Homophony rather than Polyphony (or Homorythmic Polyphony).

Polyphonic writing is based in **counterpoint** and you need to understand counterpoint before you can write it effectively.

&gt;From my understanding it is, that, in a chorale, you can put the melody in anyone of the four voices. In my example the melody has the range of an octave, so I if put the melody in the tenor, the tenor gets a lot higher than the soprano, otherwise the soprano would have to make really big jumps. What would you do about that?

No, in Chorale texture, the melody is the Soprano line.

I agree that one issue is starting with something that seems very "song like" to begin with.

Bach's chorales are written on Hymn Tunes that date back to Gregorian Chant (or are modelled after them) which had no rhythm - just strings of what we'd consider quarter notes.

There are a few Bach chorales in 3/4 but since you said you looked at some, look at ALL the elements in them - very few of them are in anything other than 4/4.

So if you're going to model something after a Bach style Chorale, get the "core" stuff right first, then you can start branching out.

I hate to tell you to look at JJ Fux's Gradus Ad Parnassum, which teaches Counterpoint from the ground up, but the approach - called "Species Approach" is actually a sound pedagogical method. You can find many examples of it online and people video series on it (see Alan Belkin's series). But really, I'd say you need to get the general principles of Counterpoint down, then start analyzing and trying to write a Chorale. Theory texts are full of them - it's the basis of what you study in theory really. Students learn to harmonize a given melody, and then realize a figured bass line. Initially you're even given both the Soprano and Bass parts and just "fill in" the middle parts with a given <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It teaches you how to do this in stages.

Most of us are all far more familiar with Homohphonic writing - melody with accompaniment, that writing in a Polyphonic Contrapuntal style is conceptually very different.

HTH.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Um, a single note is always the Tonic of a (tonal) composition.

The "tonal center" is the note, or the <b><u>harmony</u></b> built on that note (i.e. major or minor chord).

When we say "what's the tonic" we don't go "a C Minor Triad" or "C Minor" we just say "C" - the note.

An excellent way to think of tonal compositions is:

"In the key of F, major mode"

and

"In the key of F, minor mode"

and in both cases, F is the tonic.

Stravinsky wasn't really writing traditional tonal music most of time.  So I'm not sure what the phrase is referring to.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Not like element is on the same pattern if you get what I'm trying to say. 

Make sure to read u/Jongtr 's response a couple of times as he hits it all right on the head.

Yes, it's actually pretty rare for all instruments to play in the exact same rhythm for an entire song - but it is used as a special effect to add emphasis a lot of times.

&gt;Seems like in EDM, specially "house music" the drum pattern dictates the overall rhythm of a song, because no matter how you compose your melody rhythmically, the pattern of the kick and snare are "already given" so every house tracks end up sounding the same.

Yes, but because it's already given, you can consider it a "non-issue".

I sort of want to take what you're asking a little further - really, there is no "rhythm" of the song per se other than what is created by the composite rhythms of all the instruments playing at one time.

IOW, we don't usually say "the drums keep the rhythm" - instead we say "the drums keep the beat" or "keep time".

The "beat" (or pulse) is different from "the rhythm" any one instrument plays. They *might* play on the beats, but they don't have to.

If you've ever heard of "four on the floor" dance music, it means the kick drum plays on every beat. So there, the **rhythm** of the kick drum coincides with **the beat**. But the bass line could do something entirely different.

A lot of EDM styled music is "built from the drums up" and it's not uncommon to start with a drum groove and bass line, and then add <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody from there.

So the drums and/or bass, or the "rhythm section" provides the "backbone" of what is the basic rhythm of the song a lot of times.

But certainly, other parts can be very rhythmic as well and become the more important thing your ear gravitates to.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;I'm just learning about cadence so I thought it would be good to analyse modern music

There's your first mistake.

Most modern music doesn't use traditional cadences - many are "similar" but they lack a lot of the voice-leading characteristics and often only have a basic harmonic underpinning like your example here.

It would be best to study cadences in the type of music the terms originally describe - Common Practice Period music.

&gt;In classical music there's an actual conclusion but in electronic songs it seems to be the same sentence play over and over again until the track fades out at the end without conclusion. So is it possible for a song not to have a cadence at all? 

Right, the "looping" mentality has further obscured the cadence to the point that most are "elided" or the end of one thing becomes the beginning of the next in an "overlapping" kind of way which is less of a true "cadence" in traditional terms (though it's actually more akin to the kind of "avoided" or "evaded" cadences in Early Music).

There's no "final" cadence per se if it fades out, but there can certainly be other cadences within the song.

But that's exactly why this kind of music is not the best thing to study if you're looking for "textbook examples" of cadences.

Finally, you're asking about the melody note. There really isn't a "cadence" here because it's all one <b><u>harmony</u></b> from the C drone note.

There are some implied harmonic gestures, but really, it's just a Cm melody over a Cm <b><u>harmony</u></b>, so there's no real harmonic changes.

We might like to analyze these as some basic "cadence" but we'd really need modified terminology to deal with what would essentially be modified cadences (if they're cadences at all).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>How many blues songs have you learned to play? The answer is right there.

A classic "boogie" bass line is:

C-E-G-A or C-E-G-A-Bb-A-G-E-C.

We tend not to think of those so much as "arppegios" or broken chords, but as a bass line that implies a <b><u>harmony</u></b> (C6 or C7, C13, etc.)

Those patterns appear in MANY blues and blues-inspired songs and if you learn a few it'll be obvious to you.

You need to learn some basic blues type songs with basic accompaniments to start of with.

As someone else said, you're over-complicating it. Learn a couple of tunes and it's pretty obvious, it really is quite simple.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Very good.

The 3rd measure - the problem is, after that Em, we expect to hear an Am, yes, but really, root position. The C in the bass kind of makes it sound like it went back to a C <b><u>Harmony</u></b> with the A above just being some type of NCT.

It's also not uncommon especially in modern stuff to do the "toggle" between two chords - C - Em - C - Em so that C in the bass kind of reinforces that.

This may again go beyond the confines of the restrictions, but consider making the accompaniment a little more rhythmically active - you could do this and still use the same values.

For example, every time it gets to a 1/2 on the downbeat with a 1/2 in the accomp, it sounds like it "stalls".

Likewise, when an idea ends with a half, and you've got that in the accomp, it sounds like the forward motion stalls again.

Maybe a pattern of 1/4 - 1/2 - 1/4 in the accomp, which could either be "bass - chord - - - - chord" or   "bass - chord - - - - - bass"

or something of that nature. You could of course vary it within the piece but what this does is give you some rhythmic activity when the melody comes to a half note.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>1. What is "pleasing" doesn't have anything do to with science. Even in melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, despite what everyone is led to believe, it's about conditioning - expectations - meeting them, and not meeting them - context, etc. Anything you'd find would generally just be "made up" or pseudo-science. We're really talking about Aesthetics.

2. To create/understand/learn/improve you learn to play that music and take from it the ideas you like, and put them together in your own musical endeavors.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>vii^o also resolves to I.

V also resolves to vi.

Let me explain the larger structure here and maybe this will help you.

You're sort of correct about the "dissonance" - we create one, then resolve it.

To take a simple example, adding a 7th to a chord makes it a dissonant chord, and thus needs to resolve.

In Common Practice Period music, the 7th always resolves down. This stems from a long tradition in counterpoint that pre-dates the CPP.

But we can use this as an example to see how chords move "functionally".

If you have a 7th like an F note on a G7 chord, it's going to go down to E in the key of C.

The note of resolution had to traditionally be a consonance, so that means that E could be the Root, 3rd, or 5th of the following chord.

So G7 may resolve to Em, Am, or C.

This gives us some basic "moves" that are sometimes referred to as "ascending" progressions (due to a rudimentary voice-leading rather than how they're actually seen in music).

Any 7th chord will resolve to a chord whose Root is down a 3rd, up a 2nd, or up a 4th. (we could say the 3rd is actually up a 6th which makes the whole thing make more sense and is easier to remember but in music we usually move the root the shorter distance).

This means a Cmaj7 in C "should go" to Am, Dm, or F.

Now, it turns out that "functional" progressions are actually these same "ascending" progressions.

Let's look at the common functional progression:

C - Am - Dm - G - that's down a 3rd, check, up a 4th, check, and up a 4th. check.

Circle of 5ths progressions are all up a 4th. check.

Now, there's one catch here: The Leading Tone is considered to be such a powerful force, especially in conjunction with scale degree 4 which creates an additional dissonance (and the only one of its kind in the key) so chords with a B in them are treated "specially".

As I give these examples, picture a "7th-less 7th chord whose 7th would resolve down by step to a chord tone if present":


G could go to Em, or Am, or C, but because the LT is present in the G chord, only the resolutions to Am and C satisfy that need.

So for the Dominant Chord, in a Dominant function, it omits one of the possible resolutions in favor of the "stronger" ones.

Cmaj7 is interesting because again, it contains the LT, but guess what? It's both the LT and the 7th - and it being the dissonant 7th actually overpowers the LT's tendency. So it resolves as we expect - to Dm, Am, or F.

And our C, which actually is 7th-less (and doesn't contain the LT) still moves to those same chords.

But C has another "superpower" (again assuming the key of C here) in that it is the tonic, so it can really go everywhere.

If you look at a functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> chart like this:

https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2REpHx8UPlQ/V96pbIJ3NuI/AAAAAAAAAcc/_73618VE4Lg3_I3GWsk1Vb9TuQU0IZheQCLcB/s1600/000.%2BKostaChord-FlowChart.jpg

 what you will see is something like the following:

iii - vi - ii - V - I

that's up a 4th motion.

You'll also see another row with IV under ii, and vii^o under V (or otherwise in the same columns for each pair).

IV - vii^o is up a 4th.

vi - IV - down a 3rd.

vii^o - I, up a 2nd.

These all fit.

Even within their columns - IV - ii - down a 3rd. vii^o - V - down a 3rd (not pictured but vii may "turn into" a plain V before resolving). Also, ii - vii^o is down a 3rd and IV to V is up a 2nd!

You will also see arrows a lot of time showing V to vi - up a 2nd. Check.

You will also see iii "skip" vi and go directly to IV, guess what - up a 2nd. Check.

What you don't typically see is:

ii - iii

V - iii

vii^o - iii (except in sequences, which aren't really functional progressions all the time anyway)

Note that all of the "non functional" progressions involve iii.

If you don't know this already, iii is a rarely used chord in CPP functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

It also does little to establish the tonality.

A chart for Minor Key progressions looks similar, with a few differences. But it works a similar way.

____________

Now, about modes: Modes usually don't use functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> because it makes them tend to "drift towards" major. In fact, pre-CPP - pre-Tonal music didn't have functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> like this (well, it evolved over time, with the counterpoint of the dissonant 7th moving down, which began to force more ascending progressions).

We can "treat a mode as if it's a key" and try to apply some sort of functionalism to it, but very often, in order to keep a mode as "non key" sounding - which is often part of the goal, we must also eschew functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

In fact we see a post nearly every day about it. I see one a little further down today!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The usual suspects (I have both):

Samuel Adler: The Study of Orchestration

Walter Piston: Orchestration (get his <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, and Counterpoint books as well)

A little less well known but recommended often (I have none, but need to get them!):

Kent Kennan: The Technique of Orchestration (also has a good Counterpoint text).

Alfred Blatter: Instrumentation and Orchesration

Gordon Jacob: Orchestral Technique

I'd say those cover sort of the "modern" and updated books.

Rimsky-Korsakov: Principles of Orchestration - this book is Public Domain (at least in the US) and is available FREE in PDF on IMSLP.

Hector Berlioz: Treatise on Instrumentation (also available on IMSLP I believe)

Cecil Forsyth: Orchestration

I didn't know about the Prout, but it appears to be FREE as well, so there's another to consider.

These are probably the "biggies".

I believe R. Strauss wrote one too, but it's maybe a re-working of Berlioz or something like that.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's 2018, not 1818.

You're doing what pop musicians have been doing probably since the 1950s - avoiding things that sound "too classical".

Popular music even goes out of its way sometimes to avoid V.

It's actually commonplace.

What you are likely seeing is some old trope about Common Practice Period functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, which really, no longer exists. Oh, it's still around, but we've gone way beyond it.

It's "weak" by 1685 - 1885 standards, but not by 1485 or 1985 standards.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;For example, Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley

Wait, what, are we being Rick Rolled???

&gt;seems to be using the notes B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, and A♭. That tells me it must either be B-flat minor or D-flat major.

Correct.

&gt;But that is where I always get stuck inevitably. How can I tell if it's either B-flat minor or D-flat major if all the notes in those scales are exactly the same?

Is there a Db chord in the piece?

There's not (at least, not that I saw).

So it ain't in Db! 

As others have said, you have to find the "home" chord - and if it's not present, then guess what, you won't hear it, so it ain't it!!!!

In looped progressions like this, it's often the first or last chords that tell you the Key - if they're both the same it's a really good bet.

In this case it keeps resolving to the Bb though, so that's probably it....

but....

u/xiipaoc brings up a good point - a lot of modern pop music is ambiguous. And to confuse things further, a piece could be modal. And it's entirely common for a song to have the verse in Db Major and the chorus in Bb Minor or something like that (or be a different mode - in this case, the verses in NGGYU could be described as Lydian!).

I just had to learn "Shut Up and Dance" for a band and it too uses this note set. It pretty clearly starts on a Db chord. There's a drone note on Db as well in both the Bass and guitar.

And it goes into a similar idea in the verse where it starts on the Gb chord - Gb - Ab - Bbm - Ab, Gb - Ab - Db - Ab/C - Ab

So it may seem ambiguous there again, but since it stared in Db and this is sort of just a "rotation" of the chords, we'd probably still say Db.

The chorus is clearly Db - Gb - Bbm - Ab - now both Db and Bbm are in there, but Db begins the loop, and it ends on an Ab which is the Dominant (which another poster mentions) and that leads more strongly back to Db than the Gb does to Bbm - especially with it in the middle of the phrase. So we're going to hear this "centered in" Db.

The "solo" is interesting because it takes these chords and moves them around - Bbm - Db - Gb - Ab - here we'd probably say it's in Bbm because it begins the loop. Ab is still the dominant at the end but bVII often goes to i in pop music (it's the same idea as V - vi - which is a "deceptive cadence") so even though it's the dominant of Db, it sounds strong resolving to Bbm too.

It's a shame u/timmsea was downvoted because they're not wrong - for improvising, it kind of "doesn't matter" - as long as you're playing the right note set, because they're the same notes! Obviously, if we know it's major instead of minor, or even Lydian, that can help us focus on the notes that go with that scale, but that's one of the reason people use these ambiguous progressions - you get a BOGO - same notes, but two keys! So it's kind of a "hack" where you can just play one note set and let the <b><u>harmony</u></b> determine whether it's major or minor at any given point.

BTW, at the end of Shut Up and Dance it's doing the same or a similar melody over the Chorus chord progression.

Since you've got this Bbm/Db scale on your mind this would actually be a great song to look at because it may be a little less ambiguous than the Rick Astley and since there's this prominent melody line you might be able to figure out parts of it by ear and see how they deal with the melody with a given chord progression (wouldn't hurt to figure out the vocal melody too).

So brief rundown:

1. Chord that sounds like "home".

2. Chord that begins a "looped progression" or phrase/section

3. Chord that ends a looped progression or phrase/section.

4. Chord that appears very often if it's one of the two you're trying to decide between.

5. Chord that appears less often is NOT the one typically, or if it's not present at all, it's definitely not it.

6. Sections can be in different keys, or modes, or the song may have sections that are not in any one key but multiple keys. The song itself may go through different keys (modulations) and it can even not really even be in a key or mode at all. You have to listen for the "home" chord and then use process of elimination to help support you claim!

Really, try Shut Up and Dance and see what you get out of it.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;what was the basis of composition then?

MELODY!

And, multiple simultaneous melodic lines as Counterpoint.

&gt;So what was someone like Perotin thinking when writing music that he wanted to be consonant and enjoyable to listen to? Was he just winging it, putting notes together and hoping that they worked nicely with one another or was he using a theory/"formula" (akin to functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>) to know what notes sound consonant together, to know how to cause tension and how to resolve it etc.? 

Good questions. Yes, music was "consonance based" (but remember, before this it was monophonic for quite some time, so melodic ideas within modes were already well established by Leonin and Perotin).

Try the following site:

http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/

and this wonderful video series:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaCRUdxTRSM




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are two "schools" of Polychords if you like:

"Jazz"

"Classical".

Polychords where experimented with alongside Bi-Tonality (and PolyTonality) in the 20th Century (and maybe somewhat before spuriously).

The "go to" example is the 2nd movement of "Three Score Set" by William Schuman:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQWWlY-4kqE

Sorry I couldn't find a score version of the video but when you look at the music it is essentially triads in the left hand and triads in the right hand moving in opposite motion and so on.

I'm going to throw another technique at you, which is to stop focusing on chords! Music isn't really "about" chords per se and people focus way to much on them.

Seeing/hearing them stacked up like this Schuman example is pretty rare.

Instead, they're more often presented melodically, or in musical figuration, and so on. Yes it's still "<b><u>harmony</u></b>", but it's not as simplistic as "block chords" which is the way people who focus to much on the "stack" tend to think about and use them.

In something like this:

https://youtu.be/2Y9tFVTqPiE?t=3m48s

Stravinsky uses a Dm Chord in the LH with a D Major Chord in the RH. Some might argue this is a "split 3rd" <b><u>harmony</u></b> or "Minor-Major Chord" which is associated with Strav but so is Polytonality and given the division between hands and the clear outlining of the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, this seems to better seen as Bitonal and potentially Polychords based on the implication of a single chord for a couple of measures in both A sections.

This is from a set of pieces that were popular to write at the time where the melody used only 5 pitches, thus it's on the "simpler" side but again it's a good example of sort of the "opposite" way of writing - presenting two different harmonic implications against each other in melodic/accompanimental fashion.

Jazz is a different approach for the most part.

The problem with jazz can be one of semantics - there is a useful notation that developed which probably co-opted an academic term and was just a simpler, more effective way of notating more complex harmonies. One idea is simply that of an alternate Root - F/Bb for example. The other is rather than Chord/Bass Note, a more complex Chord/Chord arrangement.

Bb
_
C

Which give you C-E-G-Bb-D-F or a C11.

The problem with Jazz is, this is really a notational thing - a symbolic thing, to make it easier on players to decipher what to play when a symbol would otherwise be extremely complex.

I know of a cadence in a Benny Goodman tune that is:

G13(b9) - C6 (and the G13 may be more complex I can't remember).

But it's even voiced in the band as E/G or 

E
-
G

Which is actually brilliant because the upper parts go V7 - i in the relative minor, while the bass goes V - I in the relative Major - G to C in the bass, and E7 - Am in the upper parts! Kind of cool.

While it may be more a "compositional tool" in modern jazz writing (with which I'm not super familiar so sorry I can't provide any answers, but hopefully some kind soul will come along) it is more generally in Jazz a "notational shortcut" and not really the "basis" of a piece.

So it depends on what you're looking for in terms of learning how to implement them.

HTH

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;When you stack thirds for a chord, why is the root always at the bottom.

Simply for calculation purposes. We figure the chord from the Root, and then the interval structure above it. Thus any time we encounter a chord where the root is not on the bottom, we arrange it so it is, so we can give the chord a name.

&gt;Could the 3 be the real root and we've all been getting it wrong so far. 

Actually, Greek scales were figured from the top down, so it'd be interesting if they had developed <b><u>harmony</u></b> how they'd figure it!

Even in the Renaissance, they didn't think of chords quite the same way we do now.

They were "bass based" rather than "root based". So E-G-C was not a chord with a "C Root", but an E chord "of the 6th".

there is an acoustic principle called the "missing fundamental" and what happens is, when we hear a certain ordering of notes, if one of them is not the fundamental our brain tries to order it so there's like a "virtual root" and then if we re-order the chord so the note we think is the fundamental is the lowest note, then everything seems right with the world.

But it's kind of like asking why we read left to right. In many ways, it just happened that way.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>My Greek sucks, as does my math.

C up to F is a 4th, C down to G is  4th.

C

G

C


C

F

C

F, and G, are equidistant around C, and they both divide an octave into a resulting 4th and 5th complementary intervals.

I think that's all that's being said.

FWIW, "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" used in ancient contexts like this does not mean "chord" as we know it, but rather the broader sense of the word like "working together well" and they are talking about Scale Degrees, not chord tones.

I think this is also saying that the "center" of an octave - the tritone, is not part of the scale but the scale is symmetrical around that note - D Dorian is symmetrical around Ab, which is not in the scale.

Out of curiosity, why are you reading this?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Avoid Mama Mia and Dancing Queen and you'll be off to a good start! I think those songs are just so overplayed that it's easy to get a negative attitude going in and automatically dislike them before you've given them a chance!

I know people who dislike The Beatles just because everyone else likes them...so you never know where this stuff comes from sometimes.

Also, understand that ABBA is really a product of the times too. Keep that in mind. One thing a lot of people do is fault something for something that's not it's fault!!!

You can't fault Bach for not using Blue Notes! And you can't really fault Willie Dixon for not writing any Fugues.

So it can really help to sit back and view this through a "70s lens" if you know what I mean. Then the goofy/corny stuff becomes a non-issue and you can concentrate on orchestration, or synth textures, or  well-designed vocal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or whatever.

We played "Sugar Sugar" by The Archies in a band. I know it's manufactured. I know it's made for a TV show and mass consumption. It's corn pone as all get out. But you know, it's got some clever stuff in it. So I focus on that stuff.

Guilty Pleasure!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm not sure what you're asking, because it seems like you contradict yourself a number of times.

You said you've studied 7 years, have a "lot" of knowledge in <b><u>harmony</u></b>, all in theory, have won awards for composing, play well, and memorized pieces.

But then you say you have "wrong approaches" that you don't really explain (yet you've won awards in music theory), and you can't compose a simple logical piece (yet you've won composition awards?).

Are these not really real "awards" and just consolation prizes or "participation trophies" or something?

IOW, I don't see how you can win awards for composing, but not be able to compose a simple and logical piece. I don't see how you can win awards for theory but have wrong approaches.

You mention improvising, and that actually is a common thing among formally trained (i.e. "classical") musicians. There's actually very little need for it in most repertoire so it's not something that's focused on. I went through two college degrees and have never ever been taught to improvise in any course I took. It's not part of a formal music education unless you're studying a style - like Jazz - where it is a major factor. Specialists in Baroque music where a lot of embellishment and ornamentation is done, as well as improvising figured bass realizations learn to do it, (though really in practice it's less improvisation and more pre-composing for a performance) as do those who follow a Classical Concerto path to play a Cadenza (but even those are rarely actually improvised on the spot and typically worked out beforehand, so really "composed" instead of improvised).

Improvisation is a very, very, small and specialized thing in classical music.

In Jazz, it's a very very very big and widespread thing.

IOW, in Jazz, you MUST know how to improvise, but in classical music, you can go a long way without being able to do it.

Are you no longer studying music? Taking piano lessons? Composition lessons?

Or did you take Piano Lessons from age 5 to 12 and then haven't taken a lesson since, and you're now in your 20s or something?

What kind of school is this you're transferring to?

Are you going to a university or conservatory and majoring in music composition?

If so, how did you get in? If they have standards so low that a person who can't even write the simplest and logical piece can get in, then it should be at a good level for you.

I mean, any institution should have some admittance standards and if you've been accepted you have met those standards.

And all the stuff you're concerned about you should learn there.

I think we need more specifics in order to help you better.



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>One thing about a lot of Beatles songs, especially Paul's, is that the melodies are very melodic!

By that I mean, a lot of pop melodies are really just monotone, or sing just a few notes of a blues scale, or something like that. Paul's vocal melodies really do a lot of moving around most of the time - not unlike the great songwriters he probably grew up on (and his bass playing is similar - way under-rated bass player and very melodic on the instrument).

So I don't necessarily think it's the particular note choices per se, but the fact that you're hearing something that's less common in general (especially now) making it unique and "special" in a way.

It's also why Beatles songs tend to translate well to instrumental covers because there's a lot of melodic interest even without the lyrics (of course, we can also say they did the same with <b><u>harmony</u></b> - there are always "less common" moves and they aren't just simple 4 chord loops - except Rocky Racoon ;-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'll see if I can help:

&gt;Is there a way of conceptualizing this work without chords that would be both accessible and helpful? Maybe one more in-step with 18th C. musical understanding. Perhaps a good metaphor to explain what can seem a jumble?

Well the first step is to "unlearn" "jazz" chordal thinking and learn how to see the music through an 18th century lens.

So the first step there is this: There are only 9 possible chords. Major, Minor, Diminished, and Augmented triads, and Major 7, 7, Minor 7, Half-Diminished 7 (m7b5) and Fully-Diminished 7.

That's it. There are no "sus" chords. There are no 11th, 13th, 6, 6/9 and so on chords. There *might* be something we could call a 9th chord, but that's something that's kind of evolving throughout the time period so really, it's not until Beethoven that we start to see what we might be able to justify as "stand alone" 9th chords.

Thus, anything that's not part of one of those chords is called a Non Chord Tone. Which answers this:

&gt;When figuring chords for a measure, how to determine which notes can be ignored? In my example of m. 12 being a D7b9, some people consider it a simple D despite the Cs and Ebs in the measure. Then some consider it just a repeat of F#dim7, despite the added D in the bass.

"Some people" would be wrong :-). The C automatically makes it a very common chord - a D7. The Eb is the catch.

This is a very tricky kind of texture to work with, but your process of stacking up the notes into block chords is actually fairly correct and a good way of working.

The way I would explain how we determine what chord this is is one of process of elimination. Given what I've just told you, it can either be a D7 chord with an Eb NCT, or an F#^o7 with a D NCT (that is, let's assume that it's still only 1 chord per measure).

What we have to do is look at those two possibilities and determine which is more logical. There are lots of clues, but you have to learn them.

Firstly, let's look at some:

m. 11 is F#^o7. But, where does that chord usually resolve? The answer is G or G. Does it?

No.

But the chord in m. 12 is very similar - so maybe the chord is 2 measures long - certainly possible. Does it ever resolve to G? Yes actually - in m. 13 - or at least, so it would appear - it's "mostly" a G chord.

If the chord were D7, where does that resolve? G also. It does. So that may seem not to help us.

But, here's what's happning:

The F#^o7 in m. 11 is "turning into" a D7 by the addition of the D note, which is a "stronger" form of the same type of <b><u>harmony</u></b> (a chord with a dominant function, in this case both of which lead to Gm, which from the perspective of Gm would be vii^o7 and V7 - V7 being the "more important" dominant chord).

This Eb note is a Suspension.

Here's how a Suspension works: It has 3 parts, Consonant Preparation, Dissonant Suspension, and Consonant Resolution.

Now, when dealing with chords we often stretch this to Chord Tone - Non Chord Tone - Chord Tone.

If you follow the Eb from m.11, where it is a chord tone, it becomes a non-chord tone (NCT) in m. 12. We call this a "7-6" Suspension becuase it's a 7th above the bass note (F#). It should resolve to a 6th above F# which would be a D note. And it does - it moves to the D in the Gm chord in m. 13.

Now, this is where this is all a bit tricky because really, you don't have 2 voices as you once surmised, but FOUR (or possibly more) with extra doublings.

For this reason, you would be far better off to study Bach's Chorales to understand this principle, because pieces like this are often basically the same moves that would happen in a Chorale, only the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is "broken up" over an entire measure.

______


Now, about that pesky "add 2" in the Gm chord - which I told you it can't be because it's not an acceptable chord form.

It's a NCT again.

It is a 9-8 Suspension - A is a 9th above G and should resolve to a 8 above G (we don't worry about the octave distance, we just use the numerals like that - I'll hit more details when answering your next bullet).

So it should resolve to a Chord Tone, G, in the next chord (or next change of <b><u>harmony</u></b>). Does it?

Well, not directly. So the G the A is supposed to resolve to is in the LH. Again, we're dealing with what could be 3, or 4, or 5 parts here, with additional doublings, and sometimes composers don't always keep the voices exactly in line especially on a keyboard instrument, because we're going to hear the note that NCT is supposed to resolve to somewhere and our ear follows it.

So it looks like the A should resolve to G in the RH part instead of the Bb, but AURALLY we hear the G in the LH part as the resolution and we're cool with it.

I want to point out in both cases I've discussed so far, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> changes when the Suspension resolves. This is standard practice but Suspensions can resolve within the same <b><u>harmony</u></b> and that's where we got the names. So our 9-8 here resolves to the 8 above the original bass note of the Suspension, but we don't call it a 9-3 or something because it's a 3rd of the Eb Maj7 chord when it resolves.

_______

&gt;Are some of these suspended chords in configurations other than what I had assumed was standard (sus2 = 125, sus4 = 145). Is there such a thing as a sus chord where the the third remains? What about sus chords with odd voicings?

So yeah, "jazz" thinking versus classical thinking.

There are 4 types of suspension:

4-3

7-6

9-8

and the so-called "Bass Suspension" 2-3 (this happens in the Bass voice and is the only one that resolves to a larger interval).

There is also something called the "Consonant Suspension" which is 6-5.

9ths, 7ths, and 4ths are all dissonances above the Bass note, so any such note would traditionally have to resolve down into the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, like so:

F - F - E

A - C - C

The F above the A is a consonance, and assuming it's an F/A chord, it's a chord tone as well. It's also the "Preparation" for the suspension.

The F above the C is a dissonance. It was back then. And it's "not really" an F/C chord as we might think today. Instead, it's actually a C chord (or rather, this example would appear in a context where it was clear there would be a C chord if that F weren't present). So the F is our dissonant NCT and the "suspension" or dissonance part of the suspension idea.

The E above C is a consonance, and chord tone. It's the "Resolution" part of the suspension conglomerate.

So pop/jazz has kind of "neutered" the "suspension" idea and subsumed it into a chord tone and done away with the ideas of Preparation and Resolution (though they do happen some times).

In the above example, if other notes were present, the 3rd of the chord would not be present in either the middle or last chord because neither the note that is the Suspension (F) or the note of resolution (E) is traditionally doubled (and that by the way is one of those clues that can help you determine what one of the buggers is or is not when analyzing!).

So a chord that has a 4-3 suspension in it is going to look something like this:

C - C

G - G

F - E

C - C

or

C - B

G - G

F - E

C - E

The first where the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is the same in the chord of resolution, the second where there's a new <b><u>harmony</u></b> on the resolution (in older terms, or counterpoint without the harmonies, we call the second one a "suspension with a change of bass" which just means that when the suspension resolves, it resolves at the same time the bass note changes so you get a new implied <b><u>harmony</u></b>).

A 9-8 suspension looks like:

D - C

G - G

E - E

C - C

or 

D - C

G - A

E - E

C - A

again the 2nd one moving on to a new <b><u>harmony</u></b> when the 9th above the original bass (D over C) resolves to the 8th over the original bass (C over C) but now the bass note has changed.

Every stupid V7 - I or ii7 - V, or progression like that is actually the evolution out of a 7-6 suspension. They are 7-6 with changes of bass.

Bb - A

G - F

E - C

C - F

See the Bb is a 7 above C, and resolve to a 6 above C, but the bass changes.

Now, we have "subsumed" the 7th into the chords unlike we've done with 4 and 9 (though we will do 9 by around the later romantic period and the 4 in jazz!) but very often, even with a basic 7th chord, you will still see the 7th of the chord "prepared" by that same pitch.

Let's look:

In m.5 and 6, the Bm7b5 over a C Pedal tone (a type of NCT) has the 7th as A (LH). That A is very clearly in the previous 2 chords. So the A in the F/C chord is the Preparation, the A in the Bm7b5/C is the Suspension (though again, we just call it a chord tone in 7th chords by this time) and resolves to a G in the next chord - do you see it - it's another "transferred resolution" where the G note our ear wants to hear is in the RH.

Where does the 7th of the F#^o7 chord in m. 11 come from? That's right, the chord before.

Now this doesn't ALWAYS happen, because again we had accepted the 7th as a "chord tone" by this era, even though it was still a dissonance.

And even in counterpoint, not all 7ths arose from 7-6 suspensions.

But the point is, you can still find pure 7-6 suspensions as well as 7th chords that have a "7-6 origin" in a piece of music.

I know that's a lot to take in so I hope I didn't confuse you. As you can see it's pretty in depth and multi-layered but I would highly recommend you study some Chorales so you can start to understand where each part goes, and then it can help to make textures like this more clear as to what's happening.

HTHT
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You're welcome.

Trying to look at this Prelude as "strata" may help:

One "layer" is the Bass note at the beginning of each measure.

Another is the highest note in each measure.

The "middle layers" are a little more flexible and may not be totally independent, with some reliant on the outer layers or other inner layers, but if you can "follow" the strata like you've done in "stacking" the chords, but allow for the middle ones especially to swap places here and there, you can detect more horizonatal motion.

In fact, what we should say about a piece like this is there's a lot more horizontal lines - more like a Chorale - than there appear to be on the surface.

It begins:

G

Eb

C

G

Eb

C

Our first real "transferral" happens in m. 14 to 15 where this happens:

D - G (up a 4th)

Bb - D (up a 3rd)

A - Bb

Bb - G (up a 6th?)

G - Eb (also up a 6th?)

G - Eb (down a 3rd)

What if, instead, the chord just moves:

D - D

Bb - Bb

A - G

G - Eb

This means some voices don't follow their original strata, but it does show the 4 part underlaying movement with the resolution of the A doing exactly what it should be doing. It's just transferred to another strata. And then the other layers kind of "re-strata-gize" (haha) so that that new upper G note may not have come directly from the D before it, but is instead picked up from one of the inner strata and makes it clearer that the inner layers are maybe more of a doubling to fill out the <b><u>harmony</u></b> than independent strata themselves, though they mix roles here and there throughout the piece.

Something to notice in this regard is that the lower two notes in m. 14 suddenly drop - they might be called High Tenor and Low Tenor if they were individual parts and have thus far stayed above the Bass and in the same general area, shifting as necessary with the chord.

But here the HT and LT jump down to the low Eb - that still follows the pattern but at the same time you can see that big jump up a 6th in those two parts I notated - well it's more likely things redistributed and that the Bass kept the G note and went on to the Eb, the LT took the Bb note and went up to the other Eb (only a 4th) and the HT sort of becomes the A note with the upper parts, it resolving to the the G (so we get that aural resolution) and this all allows the upper parts to redistribute so the register of the chord goes higher (it was all getting pretty low above the staff!).

And when you know a repeated tonic <b><u>harmony</u></b> is a great place to redistribute like this because it doesn't sound too awkward if lines switch registers because it's all the same chord, this kind of makes that redistribution an obvious answer, and helps maintain the integrity of the underlying 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b>, with everything moving "as it should".

34 to 35 is another interesting case but if you can see that 33 and 35 are really the same chord just redistributed (I'm not sure about that A# in 33), it's easier to understand 34 as "connective tissue" where the layers - there's a NCT or two in there sort of "resolve" to different layers (transferred resolutions) but again because it's often common to treat keyboard playing this way (and the tone is the same so delineating which voice moves where isn't always necessary as long as the resolution takes place aurally) so it looks like the upper 3 layers just move up, but really there's some transference happening from a 4-part underlying structure perspective.

So I hope that helps a little more.

Have fun analyzing and playing!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The other posters have hit on a number of reasons.

I'm not familiar enough with his music or videos to form any opinions.

I think though, whenever you get someone who's "famous" there are going to be haters, and then there are going to be the people who think he's over-rated, and try to counter that with under-rating him more than he maybe deserves. I think a lot of times, the first group (haters) are just bashing, while the latter group (under-raters) are trying to help other people understand that he shouldn't be as over-rated as he is, but may still have genuine merit worth connecting with.

I think with a forum like this, the people who are "pro JC" post as if he's God and doing something that's never been done before, and the people who just don't see anything special are nice and keep their mouth's shut, or as mamma said, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.

I had never heard of him until I joined this forum.

I feel like - in a way - he appeals to younger people or less musically experienced people in a way like many things online today - I mean I go to "TIL" on reddit every now and again and it's hilarious for me to see things like "TIL that "The Maginifcent Seven" is a remake. I'm like, no sh!t sherlock.

I thought about ideas like Negative <b><u>Harmony</u></b> when I was 12. I just didn't have the internet and YT to make it go viral. That's not jealousy or bitterness, it's just a statement. But as I matured musically I realized it was a neat idea and could be something you could actually put to use in a piece, but it wasn't like I had come up with something radical that hadn't been done before - it was just most likely a re-make of something someone else already did (though I couldn't really find out in the way people can today).

IOW, when you learn that Mag 7 is a remake, it puts it in a different perspective - such as, "gee, TIL every stinking movie H-wood makes is a re-make, re-imagining, sequel, pre-quel or otherwise based on other people's work. How about a little OC H-wood?".

So I think some of the appeal of JC is that it's something that's new to a lot of people who get excited about such things, and maybe the guy is a marketing genius and is taking advantage of the trend of "naming" things - which I see in media and all kinds of other things.

The other day, I said "Key Collective" or something like that and I got a response from someone that was immediately treating it as if it were some exciting new concept they had do go and learn everything about even though I said it was my term for the idea - but they used it in a way as if it was "Secondary Dominant" and that matter-of-fact a term.

And i agree with another poster - he's sort of making up "catchy" names - almost "click bait" names for things that are already well established, and that means to those who know more, he comes of as someone with a lot a talent who's more interested in making up his own terms than using existing ones.

It's kind of like saying G-E-C is a "G Neg Minor Chord". When it's already just plain old C Major. But everyone is like "ooh ooh ooh oohh neg minor what's neg minor explain neg minor to me..."

I mean honestly, as an older person, it seems to appeal to the Minecraft set (which my kids were a few years ago - until they grew out of it).

I won't say it "threatens" people, but there is - in the US especially - a dangerous state of "dumbing down" and while on the one hand it's good that someone is making otherwise boring theory topics exciting, he's also sort of re-writing the terminology in a way that's not really all that logical or helpful.

This happened years ago with the so-called "Mu Major" of Steely Dan, and when it hit the internet people went crazy - ooh ooh ooh Mu Major what's Mu Major is there Mu Minor where can I learn about Mu....

So another thing is, it can be seen just as a fad as well. And that starts another cycle of lack of credibility, where the likers like that much more and the haters hate that much more to counterbalance it.

So there's lots of layers to that onion.

Me personally, I've not seen that much, but what I have seen is stuff I've all seen before, just dressed up in appealing-to-social-media-generation-unawares presentation.

I'm not saying there not substance there, but from my perspective on this forum, he's definitely over-rated as far as my specific experience with his content and others fascination with/excitement about it.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes. No. Maybe. Depends. (I'm exciting that's the 3rd time I've been able to use that today!)

Fux's book is, shall I say, bad. Ok, it's not that bad. But it's not "the bible" as everyone makes it out to be.

What's kind of happening is, it's a bit anachronistic and, at best, explaining principles that are already outdated for the style that was being written at the time.

I suppose, if you were living in Bach's day (or at the end of Bach's days), and wanted to learn how to write pre-Baroque counterpoint for whatever reason, it was a good resource.

But we have much better resources than that now.

Even Haydn and Mozart, who studied it, changed the cadences to functional cadences of their contemporary time.

So it really depends on what you're trying to get out of it.

IMHO, Species Counterpoint is very good at teaching the basics of contrapuntal writing in a rather "rule-based" format - which I think is good and necessary for anyone wanting to learn that particular style or who wants to be able to use that information for their own purposes.

But, at some point, the book becomes overkill unless you're really looking to compose just like Fux is telling you to compose, which isn't really a "real" style - it's sort of an anachronistic amalgam of techniques presented in a didactic framework (3rd time I got to use didactic today too, I'm on a roll!) that doesn't really help a person produce "real" music of any era.

For those goals, I'd recommend some other types of studies.

But, what that means is:

1. Fux wasn't really using functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, nor should you, unless you're going to do the Haydn/Mozart approach.

2. The music Fux is culling his rules from - that of "the masters" he constantly refers to, was also not functional, so no, in appropriate if you're trying to write Palestrinian style (which Fux is to varying degrees of looseness based on).

3. If you don't care about such things and want to use this as a means to understand counterpoint in Tonal music where it is more functional than not, then yes, you should be trying to do it. But honestly I think you'd be better off with a different approach.

For a TLDR, read vornska's post, because that pretty much sums it up more succinctly.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>&gt;Listen to pieces along with a score, and listen to them repeatedly

100%. But you should also be analyzing them, seeing how they work, or what is typical or not typical and so on. Likewise, you should play them on the Piano as well where practical - even if one part at a time. Since you're interested in vocal music, it would be ideal if you learned to sing, or at the very least could sing through the melodies, again, seeing what is typical, what is not, when to breathe, and so on.

&gt;Honestly, my advice is just to write, and to challenge yourself. Write a lot. Write every minute of your spare time. The more you write, the easier it'll get.

I agree with this as well, though obviously writing without any kind of means for indentifying weaknesses and improving on them won't help you as much than if you do have some mechanism for that (since you say you have private instruction, that's good because at the very least you have someone to bounce ideas off of).

&gt;I think a lot of beginners tend to place too much importance on books. I don't mean to say that they're bad, but expecting to learn how to write music by reading books is a bit like trying to learn tennis by reading the official rule book.

I'll second this part as well. I often use the analogy of riding a bike - you can read about the mechanics of how bikes work, gear ratios, caliper brakes, balancing wheels with the spokes, general principles, and even read about gravity and centrifugal (or centripetal whichever it is) force but until you get on the darn thing and fall off a couple of times, you won't get it.

That said, there of course is information you can read to prepare you - you can read for example that squeezing the handle applies the brakes, and had you gotten on and rode without that knowledge you'd have to run into a tree to stop. 

So with that in mind, if your goal is to be able to write four part vocal music, you probably of course want to study 4 part vocal music (as per the first thing I quoted above) and then you want to spend some time with the "rules" of 4 part writing that have been generated from others who've studied it and who've distilled that information for us s a set of "rules".

The basics of Counterpoint can be really important (and applicable even if not writing that exact style) and learning basic Species Counterpoint is a great start (no reason to do ALL of Fux's *Gradus ad Parnassum* but usually at least through 5th species is grounding enough.

Likewise, the basics of 4-Part writing is also really important (and again, even if you're not writing that particular style) and that can be gotten through many <b><u>harmony</u></b>/theory texts like the Kostka/Payne already mentioned.

There are also websites that teach both (but make sure you use multiple sources, not just 1 or 2).

Bach's Chorales are usually considered the "textbook" examples of 4 Part Writing and they are in fact the basis of many textbooks or at least the sections on 4 part writing.

The cool part about what you want to do is you can actually get some good mileage with 2 and 3 part writing for voice while studying, and start to make little pieces and try them out with other people or have them sing it with you (it would not be a bad idea to hook up with some choristers who are willing to help you who are able to read or at least learn the parts).

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>So, kind of the issue here are the definitions of what is Tonal, and what is Serialism.

I'm not familiar with all of the pieces mentioned but a MELODY that uses all 12 tones is not necessarily SERIAL.

And even if a Melody does use all 12 tones according to general Serial principles, very often it is not a Serial or 12 tone PIECE, but just the melody, played over a traditional (or somewhat traditional) harmonic backing.

IOW, to be "truly" Serial, in the strictest definition of the term, if there is a 4 note chord on beat 1, it needs to be the first 4 notes of the row, or 3 with one doubled, or something like that.

IOOW, to have a <b><u>harmony</u></b> that goes I - IV - V7 - I with a chromatic scale played in order is not specifically "12 tone serialism" - it's just a chromatic scale over a tonal progression.

This is the same thing when people say music is using the Pentatatonic Scale, or is Quartal. Really what they actually mean is that the MELODY ONLY is made up of Pentatonic notes, not the entire piece, which is just plain old <b><u>harmony</u></b>, meaning the melody is actually more of a derived set. Likewise, most "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" people talk about is merely quartal *voicings* again usually set against a tonal (or largely tonal, or tonally descended, etc.) framework.

When you get into defining Tonality, there can be a lot of grey area but a lot of the pieces being mentioned are not "Textbook Tonal" and even push the boundaries of "Extended Tonality".

The following tone row:

Ab Gb Bb Db Eb A F D B G E C

could be divided up like so (consider these harmonies per measure):

Ab-Gb | Bb-Db-Eb | A F | D-B-G | C-E


And that gives you a IV - V - I idea at the end which we can hear as fairly tonal, despite the oddness of the opening two harmonies (but Bb-Db-Eb resolves nicely to A-F-D if you wanted to do that!)

So it's possible to make a 12 tone serialistic piece that's fairly strict generate tonal chord progressions if you wanted to - but really, part of the whole idea was not to generate these things - because you could just use regular notes to do that!

FWIW, I have always viewed Atonality, Serialism, and Dodecaphony as 3 distinct elements that can be used alone, in combination with each other, or in combination with other elements - they are "tools" for achieving a particular sound or result. But the "main purpose" of using Serial techniques in conjunction with Dodecaphony was to generate Atonality and since we had existing means to generate tonality, the intent of these things was not to re-invent the wheel but to use something to generate Atonality specifically, which the existing system didn't do as well (as it was entwined with tonality).

So if you're being strict about the terminology, there are probably very few works (especially any that are well known) that are Tonal, Serial, and 12 Tone. They are "inherent opposites" in intent and have to kind of be "forced" to work - they can, but it was kind of like "well, that's not the point" for people working with it.

But, if you're saying "that *use* 12 tone serialism in ANY capacity" then it appearing just as a melody over a traditional tonal progression is more common, as the Bach example even shows (Fugues, like Canons, have serial elements already).

I believe the Fugue from *Thus Spake Zarathustra*: Of Science has a 12 note subject and since it would be treated imitatively, has some serial elements.

Cheers
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I only have the Reimanschneider or however you spell it edition of "the 371" - which you can tell are old reprints and crammed together on the page.

You might want to check out Charles Burkhardt's "Anthology for Musical Analysis" which contains a number of chorales. It also has an index in the back that lists out particular aspects of the chorales contained therein like "Chorales that use vii^o6 " or "Chorales with Secondary Dominants" or things like that. It was a fairly extensive categorization and meant to be pedagogical so you could find the ones that had, say only Root Position chords, or only Diatonic Chords, or something like that (those are simplistic explanations as I can't remember which they were exactly, but it was nicely done so you could find things).

There's no answer key or anything, but those things helped you know what you were getting yourself into.

The book has a number of other pieces included and IIRC most of the Chorales were towards the back and it had more of them than anything else. Everything else in the book was roughly chronological, starting with Gregorian Chant and moving through 20th century music - then the ending section with all the Chorales.

Each piece also had some information before it that spoke about something to think about critically, like I remember there was this piece in minor that the author said something like "this piece differs from traditional minor. Can you see how and how would you describe it?" So they were sort of like "prompts" for use in classroom discussion (or something your professor could make you answer as part of the assignment - growl).

Unfortunately the book is kind of pricey. ($100 new on Amazon, one used one is 20 bucks!)) but you might be able to find some used ones that aren't all marked up. If you decide to get one try to get the Spiral Binding because it opens up and lays flat which is really nice (looks like the new ones still have that).

I will say this about the Reminschneider 371 - the back section has 69 Figured Bass exercises so that's kind of cool because you can use that to realize harmonies for them.
_____

A lot of companion workbooks to Theory/<b><u>Harmony</u></b> texts have exercises in 4-part writing that are actually really good because they're done like so:

1. Given melody, Given Bass, given Figures, you fill in the inner voices and are thus "guided" by the given elements to write good writing.

2. Given Bass, with Figures - you do the melody and inner parts.

3. Given melody, - you harmonize it with the other 3 parts.

4. Given chord progression - you write everything.

So having some elements given at first help you not have to have to worry about too many things at once.

Unfortunately these can be pricey as well.

As for other collections of the Chorales, unfortunately I don't have any recommendations.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In ONE STYLE, Common Practice Period Tonality, a 2nd Inversion Triad was *treated as* a Dissonant structure in need of resolution (thus "unstable") or as an otherwise "unimportant" <b><u>harmony</u></b> (passing, neighboring, etc.).

This came from evolving out of earlier counterpoint where the interval of a 4th in combination with the Bass note was a dissonance that must be resolved.

The Common Practice Period ended over a century ago now. Some people (maybe unfortunately) still write in that style or one very similar to it, but we've moved on since then. If you want to write a pop song with a bunch of 2nd inversion chords in, you are free to do so (like the band Yes did in the Wurm part of Starship Trooper, which begins with Guitar playing 2nd inversion chords, and when the bass line enters it often follows, or plays above the lowest note of the guitar, maintaining those inversions).

I wrote a piece for guitar once with two movements, both with nothing but triads in 2nd inversion to show people (on a forum long time ago) you can write music without following the "ancient rules" of the CPP.

I think you need to throw away that book OP, and learn real music by real people.

Even if some of the information is correct - or correct for one style - it's far better to learn music from music, not from a book.

And FWIW, "stability" is a ridiculous thing to get caught up in. None of us (well, with any experience) are sitting around going "gee, I can't use that chord here, it's too unstable". We select sounds based on what sound we want to hear. And that comes from the experience of listening to, learning to play, and experimenting with making music.


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>1. "CP" on the internet means a different thing than what we musicians use it for, but "a little CP" could attract some unwanted attention.

2. Usually what I tell people is, if I make a comment about something I feel needs improvement, and then you go "yeah, I was thinking the same thing" then it probably does need improvement! Especially if anyone else says it as well!!!

It's hard to critique music like this because we now live in an era where pretty much "anything goes" artistically speaking. We can only say if things are bad or good or wrong or right when we have a reference point to work from - for example, if someone is trying to write a Chorale just like Bach, it's easy to say "well, Bach would have never done *that*" but if it's a modernistic Chorale in Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> or something, it's much harder to make those kinds of statements because there's not some huge body of work to compare it to.

So my comments are going to be based here on "traditional counterpoint".

1. You begin with what is essentially a C Major scale up and back, in a key of C Major.

2. The LH notes in m. 2 sound "wrong" because you've led us to believe this is C Major, and you're even doing it again in the RH, but you're accompanying it with notes that play a G Major chord.

3. From a traditional standpoint, the interval of the Perfect 4th between any upper voice and the lowest voice (Bass) was a no-no. So you not only begin on the "wrong" note, but each note of that G Chord is a Perfect 4th below the melody note, continuing the wrongness. And the reason why, as I already said, is it seems like you're trying to accompany a C Major Melody with a G <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

4. That is not impossible, but the problem is, the way the piece begins you kind of set us up for this one expectation, and that makes this other thing seem like a mistake, not an intentional artistic choice. Since you named it Counterpoint, and we all read that first, we're also going in with certain expectations.

5. m. 7, that E note sticks out like a sore thumb because it's an octave. That ascending bass line makes it seem like the bass should continue to D, and when it jumps to E, and the other part jumps to E, it makes it sound "empty" all of the sudden - almost like one part drops out - and because they were both jumped to, it draws unwanted attention - you just basically said "Hey everyone, I'm writing music with rich harmonies, but look, here's all of the sudden this empty <b><u>harmony</u></b> (or lack thereof) for no apparent reason!". Compare this with m.8 with the B on beat 2. It is also empty but becuase the lines "cross" (called voice exchange) C-B-A and A-B-C it's not quite as bad as it sounds like it's just "filling in" between those other two harmonies.

6. m. 9 is really odd. Firstly, you have B against C, which isn't so bad coming from the previous C, but then it moves to A against B, then it goes to another Perfect 4th, and then the really odd bit is that the LH note plays the same note G that the RH just did, making it sound not like the LH melody went there (which is what you imply you want by writing it this way) but that the RH melody has that note and just repeats it.

7. m. 10 has more of those "empty" octaves - one solo note (so no <b><u>harmony</u></b>) then an 8ve with that (not really too much more <b><u>harmony</u></b>) and then BOTH of them move to the same new note at the same interval (this is called Parallel 8ves). Again, this really weakens the harmonic structure. It's especially bad here because the notes you're using are the DOminant and Tonic degrees of the Key of C Major and are SUPER familiar pattern to most listeners (even casual listeners) and people are going to hear this as maybe a pickup in the middle of the measure - meaning that really this measure has its metric impulse in the wrong part of the measure - it sounds like the C notes are BEAT ONE, not beat 3. That's because this pattern of 5-1 is so common at the end or beginning of the piece where that 1 note is on Beat 1. And because you made it just plain octaves moving the same distance the same distance apart, it really calls attention to itself in a way that say either "C is beat 1" (which is not what you intended) or "what are they doing, that was in the wrong place".

8. The 2nd to last measure - look at the rhythm in the melody. This is a common thing I see in a lot of beginner works, but it also points to something that you should always be asking yourself when you are writing music - "what is the point of this" - not in an existential way, but "what is the point of this note" or "what is the point of this rhythm" and so on.

What you did here was introduce a rhythm that you've not used for the entire piece - and it doesn't seem like there's any good reason to do it. Sometimes, things like this *do* happen as a "signal" that something important is about to happen, but this doesn't do that effectively (and again, remember I'm comparing this with traditional counterpoint).

Composers often use "self-referential" things in a piece - they'll use ideas that were earlier in the piece again towards the end. It kind of "ties things together in a neat little bow".

A great example would be, here, you could rather than repeat the first 4 measures at the beginning (or in addition to doing so) repeat them at the end instead, having m. 4 just resolve to a C chord on the next measure - grace note G, to grace note G, to end. That also gives that one measure with the half notes (and not as much rhythmic motion) and no <b><u>harmony</u></b> (other than the implication of a G chord) a "reason for being" - this one isn't so bad alone because it sounds like the end of a phrase and you repeat it in the repeat, so it makes a little more sense than the thing at the end (which has far less "identity") but again, repeating that idea at the end would give the piece more structural integrity, and "inner logic" if you will.

A different way to accomplish a "better" ending would be to use m. 3's rhythmic and melodic idea in the RH as the 2nd to last measure. This allows the 8th note motion to come to a natural winding down (plus, we've heard it before where it did exactly that) without coming to the kind of "WTF stop" it does with that peculiar rhythm it currently has.

There are tons of ideas like that I could go on and on about, but that gives you a general idea.

---------

I would recommend:

1. Study more pieces like this - it looks like you've modeled it after like a Bach Little Prelude or something, which is fine. But you need to learn a few more things as well:

2. Learn <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, and chords and how to make them, and how to make melody notes "go with" the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and vice versa.

3. Learn some *basic* counterpoint. You don't have to go hog wild and go trough all of Fux's *Gradus ad Parnassum* but it would be helpful for you to start watching some YT series like Alan Belkin's Counterpoint videos. There are plenty of resources like that.

4. While I agree with the "write everyday" thing in theory, in reality it's not always that easy, and if you're not in the right frame of mind, the writing you do on a "bad day" really doesn't help you learn much. Instead, instead of "writing everyday", try to write every day if you can, but also set aside some time to try to improve things like what you did here, and spend some time listening to and PLAYING music like this so you can "intuit" it more, and spend some time with "educational materials" such as books, videos, and then some time on exercises. There are books on composing written in a "prompt" style which can be very helpful.

This is EXCELLENT for a first attempt! So don't let all of the comments I made bring you down - I'm trying to help, and you said don't hold back! There's a lot to learn and you just have to tackle it one element at at time. But really you've got a lot of potential here. I think you're taking the right approach, and your results indicate that you've got a good foundation in a general sense - now it's time to just start honing things in.

I would STRONGLY recommend you study with someone who can help you - you'll progress WAY faster if you do that.

And thank you for sharing and being willing to take criticism - it takes a lot of courage to do that.

I hope you find some of what I said useful. But even if you didn't, keep on writing!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; I just didn't understand why in a lead melody the third is most stable than a fifth but not for a bassline...

Well, it's not. If a book is saying that, throw it away.

In a *cadence*, the most *final sounding* <b><u>harmony</u></b> is one where the melody note plays the Root of the Tonic chord.

It's relatively uncommon for it to play the 5th of the chord at all, and the 3rd is *comparatively* rare. But, a melody on its own, ending on 5 is probably not going to sound very "final", and a melody with a <b><u>harmony</u></b> that ends on 3 is going to sound "more final" than one that ends on 5, but one on 1 is WAY more final.

That can be true to some degree within the piece, but sometimes we actually want a cadence to NOT be TOO final because we're going to have the more final one later. So it's very common to see a cadence on 3 in the middle of the piece, then a cadence on 1 at the end (those being the melody notes over the same chord).

But, unless you're specifically talking about that one particular context, and especially in the larger context of CPP style, that's really not a statement worth making (as you originally put it - at least unless you have some other context where it may be relevant but I would doubt that was the case in the book).

The 5th in the bass is "unstable" for the reasons I stated before - it evolved from counterpoint that way. So again, in CPP style, 2nd inversion chords are actually only used in very specific circumstances, not just freely within a progression. And this by the way is only true for Triads, not for 7th chords (which are unstable because they're 7th chords, so the inversion doesn't matter for them).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There's absolutely nothing at all that makes a dominant 7th chord bluesy.

We can easily prove this by its use for a century or more before blues was even a thing.

What makes it sound "bluesy" is the context in which you hear it. IOW, no one thought it sounded "bluesy" until they started using it in blues.

And it's more "Blue notes" that make things sound bluesy rather than the <b><u>harmony</u></b> itself.

It's the "rub" of the Bb against the otherwise expected B natural in a piece in the key of C that sounds "bluesy".

Same with b3, and b5 - Eb and Gb in the key of C. Those notes - especially when their "out of keyness" is further heightened by not being exactly those notes (i.e., bending the pitches).

But a C7 in the key of C is just not going to sound "bluesy" on its own. It's more about HOW it's played and the context it's played in, especially then the Bb note is a blue note in whatever context we're hearing it in.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'll make a little bit of a joke:

Basically, if they can "justify" it, it's OK.

It actually usually sounds really bad to me. In many cases, it sounds like they don't know what they're doing, or just doing it to try to impress people, and in both cases are justifying it through some extreme means which doesn't make it any better.

(read on dear readers before extracting any single statement out of context and flaming and downvoting me for it - i soften that blow later :-)

There are many ways to do it - still, I won't necessarily any of these are always effective IMpersonalO.

Many people just pick some scale that produces outside notes, and play that scale. Simple as that. And their "justification" is at the core, that this collection of otherwise "wrong" notes is part of some named scale, so it's OK.

"Hey, I'm using Bbm Pentatonic over C Major for an 'out' sound"...

(my response, while trying to be fair and open-minded is 'no, you're playing the wrong scale' :-)

Another, maybe more musical way (IMHO), is to use chromatic Non Chord Tones but not resolve them as soon as they would have been traditionally.

An "enclosure" is a great example - the chord tone may be an A, so the play could play a Bb or G# chromatic approach tone, or go from G# to Bb before the A - an "enclosure" (chromatic). This is sort of the beginning of "out" and if you play these notes more, or longer, or don't resolve at all before moving on to another set, you get "outside" playing.

I think what happened is, people were doing just this, and other people went "Hey, those notes make up X scale, so if I play X scale over Y progression, it'll automatically give me good outside playing". So we sort of ended up with a "dumbed down" approach as in my first example.

Another very common thing is to "anticipate" another chord change - so you actually start playing a new scale (or in a new key if you like) before the current <b><u>harmony</u></b> has ended. This makes only the tail end of a measure/<b><u>harmony</u></b> "out" if you like but again it's a way to "ease into" the sound without playing something that otherwise seems totally random. The opposite can be done as well - playing an old scale into a new <b><u>harmony</u></b> that probably should take a different set of notes (but this is less common because it's more likely to sound like that beginner who doesn't know to change with the <b><u>harmony</u></b>).

Yet another thing which I actually really find to be more musically satisfying is what I might call "sequential" or "pattern-based" outside effects - as they sound more like that to me - intentional for a particular effect. Something like this would a 4 note lick that just ascends chromatically, or some arpeggio that is an odd chord to begin with that just descends chromatically, or in whole tones, etc. to produce odd effect. For me, bonus points when they start "in" and end "in" in a logical way, with the stuff in between causing the "out" parts of it.

I suppose I'm guilty myself in saying here that I feel the "sequential" aspect of it "justifies" it in a way that's more appealing to me than a scale-based approach.

But I'd like to say this: Even playing "inside" notes isn't ever musical just becuase they're inside. Playing things Musically involves more than just note choices. The people who just "run scales" with inside notes are not very musical. So it stands to reason that doing the same thing with scales that produce outside notes will be any more (or less) musical.

I think some people see that process as something that gives "running scales" more - I don't know, "complexity" or something, so again it's kind of a justification for playing non musically. - "hey, you're just running a Bb Harmonic Minor scale" "Yeah, but I'm in E Major, so it produces an 'outside sound', isn't that hip?"

IOW, look for musicality in musical gestures - whether they be diatonic or chromatic, in or out, not in "scales" - it's not so much what you play, but how you play it!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; B) I’ve watched videos about chord voicing and it makes sense now. It is basically two triads playing at the same time, but the lower triad is comprised of notes removed from the original one. Also, one should add a seventh by adding +3 or +4 to the highest note of the original chord in order not to lose too much thickness. Then I can even expand the « vagabond » notes to all their concordant keys (E4 can be moved to E2 and E5).

Yes, so what we do to make chords bigger than Triads is to keep stacking notes "every other letter" (+3 or +4, staying within the key).

C-E-G = C Triad

C-E-G-B  =  C Major 7 chord (we call it "7" because it's the 7th letter above the root)

You could also consider that a C-E-G triad overlapped with a E-G-B triad.

C-E-G-B-D = C Major 9 chord (could be multiple triads overlapped, or sharing the top note of the lower triad, or even two 7th chords overlapped, etc.)

C-E-G-B-D-F - C Major 11 chord

C-E-G-B-D-F-A - C Major 13 chord.

That's all 7 notes of the scale, so in practice we don't keep going after that.

All of these can also be voiced with multiples of notes, and in any order, though we usually don't think of C-D-E-F-G-A-B as a 13th chord!

Likewise, it's common to leave off notes that are deemed "unessential" so sometimes you may see a chord that doesn't easily stack into 3rds, like C-Bb-E-A. That would be a C13 chord, but it doesn't have the 5th of the chord, the 9th, or the 11th. But it has the "essential tones" in order for us to understand it as that chord. It's kind of like that thing whre pple wrte thngs withot al th vowls nd you cn stll fgre out wht it sas.

&gt;C) Aren’t scales purely arbitrary? For exemple, I can chose to stick to C# scale, but I have heard about Lydian, Phrygian, etc. modes, which bring back possibilities and remove some. To be frank, I've never bothered with that in the past. I just focus on the the "melodic" progression of the chords. Usually, I start by the bass note, and make it evolve until I'm satisfied with the movement. Then, I add the real chord to it. Maybe it sounds like heresy to a connoisseur? 

Well, "arbitrary" no, and in the way you're using it, not really.

If you want to write a piece in F Phrygian, you would still use exclusively or primarily the notes in F Phrygian. It would sound a little different than F Minor and even more different than F Major, but it still works the same way. What I was saying before about sticking to chords "in the key" - after that, probably the next best method would be to use chords from "related modes", so if you were in F Major, ordinarily you'd stick to chords from F major. But, if you were going to use something outside of the key probably the first place to try chords from is F Minor, and then the other F Modes, like F Lydian, F Phrygian and other F scales.

Starting with the Bass note is not uncommon, though most people start with entire Chords first (and many people use chord in root position only). Then they write a melody to that. Historically, composers did the opposite - the would take a melody first (it is the most important thing after all) and then harmonize it with chords. In Counterpoint, they'd start with the melody and then add a bass line first, then fill in the inner harmonies sometimes.

But "harmonizing a melody" is the way someone like Bach would have worked when he wrote a Chorale. "melodizing a <b><u>harmony</u></b>" is the way more pop musicians write today (and maybe why there's fewer good melodies being written in general).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Frank actually lived near me and came to our university twice.

We have a lot of Jazz artists come in - big name people. Foster stood out to me because when he took a ride you could have taken away all the accompaniment and you could hear all the changes in what he played. It really reminded me of a Bach solo Recorder type piece where all the chord progressions are strongly implied by the single solo line. Foster's playing was so beautiful in that way - it was always melodically interesting, and melded with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> beautifully and just seemed like - as corny as it sounds - he was just simply an extension of the instruments and the music flowed out in a, dare I say, supernatural way.

His playing made more of an impression on me than anyone I had ever heard before or have heard since. Even when he quoted something, it fit right in the piece and the harmonic progression. It was uncanny.

He was older when I heard him (this would have been in, maybe the late 90s early 00s) but his tone was gorgeous, his playing effortless, I mean, it was just so a part of the music. Inspired. Inspiring. Inspirational.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If I'm reading the diagram right (am I?) it also shows a generalized preference from smaller intervals - that is the Perfect 4th is preferred melodically over the Perfect 5th, and the major and minor 3rds only slightly beat out the 2nds (which aren't notated - where they studied?).

In the one in the article, it's interesting that the 8ve ranks so highly!

Decades ago, on a forum not unlike this one, with many of the same conversations, one person made a great point in that scales of most cultures focus on smaller intervals and are in 2nds or 3rds or various tuning equivalents and this pretty readily correlates to an evolution from "speaking" to "chanting" to "singing" where both the rhythmic and pitch elements of speech are "stylized" into more consistent patterns.

One thing I take from this is that, on some level, the smallest interval chosen melodically would be one where there's a noticeable pitch difference - enough to tell they are different notes (so there's some average lower threshold there probably) and my feeling is in a culture that developed <b><u>harmony</u></b>, the smallest interval at first needed to be one that was harmonically distinct as a new pitch level, rather than a scalar succession (2nds or at that time, 3rds or tuning equivalents) thus the 4th and 5th became sort of the "smallest harmonic unit that wasn't a scale step" aside from the octave.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; This reddit is described as "A subreddit for people who care about composition, cognition, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, scales, counterpoint, melody, logic, math, structure, notation, and also the overall history and appreciation of music."

Thank you for pointing that out. I hadn't really investigated that so yes, I'd agree that it is relevant to the subreddit.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;But modes are not keys, and thus don't work at all like keys and trying to use chord progressions that are used in standard major/minor keys will not work with modes. 

Hmmm. This may be a little too black and white to be a wholly accurate description of what happens in a lot of music.

Modes are often *treated as if they are keys* so it may be a moot point whether they truly are or not. There are certainly plenty of examples of modal music where the modal aspects are used in a similar manner to traditional major/minor key processes.

&gt;Have no chords. Start and end all your melodic lines on the D, like the Gregorian monks did.

While "ancient" modal music did begin with monophonic chant, that evolved to <b><u>harmony</u></b> from about the 1100s through the 1500s and all the music during that time has both chords and is modal. 

&gt;Have very limited chords like the Dm, or Dm6 for Dorian for example, and maybe do something like Miles Davis did with So What and modulate to dorian from another root.

Again, you're ignoring all of the modal music that appears from about the 1100s through the 1500s. All of that music is modal, and uses an abundance of chords.

It appears you're taking examples of modal music *that your are familiar with* and using those to justify a position that omits a lot of other music that is counter to that position.

There's more modal music out there than Gregorian Chant or Modal Jazz.



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; They are not even remotely close to one another. Modes were traditionally monophonic - just a single melodic line with no <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 

You are incorrect.


Please watch this and edify yourself:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyq48eybjZw

Here is a piece from the 1300s that is in the Dorian Mode. I'm linking to the 2nd Movement, Kyrie, where the <b><u>harmony</u></b> begins. The first 5 minutes is a monophonic chant on which the mass is based (which appears in the lowest voice in the Kyrie).

https://youtu.be/1gEV42RKf6E?t=5m14s

Modes are not simply "monophonic" or even "traditionally" so.

Here is Debussy's String Quartet, which labelled "in G Minor" begins in G Phrygian with the constant use of Ab (among other chromatic notes). This is a perfect example of a composer "treating a mode like a key" and it is not at all uncommon.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8I7uHb7GY0

IOW, there is modal music outside of Gregorian Chant and Modal Jazz.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Are all chords, notes, bassline, etc made diatonically? 

No.

&gt;Its C#m - E - C#m - B - A - B - C#m - D - C#m - B - G#m - A. Why does this work?

It's mostly diatonic. The key of C# minor or E Major would contain everything but the D chord.

I think what you're missing is this:

Most music is mostly diatonic.

But think of it as being "multi-diatonic" - that is, everything comes from a key - some key - not necessarily all the same key though.

A lot of music is just purely diatonic.

But, when people use chords from outside of the key, they most often do so by "borrowing" chords from another closely related key (or mode) or by using chords from a "secondary" key which is also closely related.

They also sometimes use chords from more remote keys, but on a basic level you can say the less related they are, the rarer they are in general.

So in your example, that D chord must "come from" somewhere else - it's either a dominant chord that's used from another key (it would be a V chord from another key typically) or it's "borrowed" from a closely related mode.

D is the V chord in the key of G - which is pretty clear we're not in here - there's not even a G chord for it to lead to (which is what V chords often do - lead to their own I chord).

If the key is E Major, which was one of our options, we would first look at E minor and see if a D chord can come from there, or, is D Diatonic to E minor? Yes, it is.

So we'd say the D chord is "borrowed" from the parallel key of Em, to be used in E.

Now, there are other options sometimes but those are the first two that should be eliminated. As a general rule, in modern popular music Borrowing is super super common so that would be the place to rule out first.

Now, if the key here was C#m (hard to tell without context) the D chord *does not* appear diatonically in C# Major, the parallel mode.

But it is common to have a "bII" chord in Minor Keys (and Major to a lesser extent) which was historically called the "Neapolitan" chord. That could explain it here.

But most people don't know this option well and instead will go to another parallel mode first.

So we'd look at all the possible C# modes - Ionian (major), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (Minor) and Locrian and see if this chord appears in any of those as a diatonic chord.

It does, in C# Phrygian.

So most people - assuming the piece is actually in C#m, would say the D chord "comes from" or "is borrowed from" C# Phrygian.

Likewise, it's also possible if it's the key of E Major, the D chord could be borrowed from any mode that has it - we usually go with plain old minor first, as opposite to major, but a lot of rock/pop music is very blues-based and in that kind of context we'd probably say it is borrowed from Mixolydian instead (D appears "natively" in E mixolydian).

When there are multiple options like that, we use other evidence to decide which is the best thing to call it, but honestly, it's not really all that important.

The reason why it works is you've heard these things billions of times before and have already accepted they sound good, so they're not super crazy or anything - the might sound a little "hey, what was that" - enough to sound fresh and different, without sounding *too* different. C#m - D - C#m is just up and back a half step and we might hear this in the key of A, or F#m pretty regularly, so it doesn't sound too out of place in the key of E or C#m (and both those Mixolydian and Phrygian/Neapolitan sounds have been around for centuries as well).

When it comes to adding melodies, this is where it gets tricky.

When all the chords are in one key, you can add a melody in that key. For any chords that are not in the key, you either have to make a momentary change to your key (could just be a single note) or you have to change your scale to another key.

In the case of your progression above, E or C#m would work for pretty much all of it except the D chord. Since it's just that one chord, all you have to do is change the D note in the key (which would be D#) to D natural for that one chord. The rest of the notes in the D chord are still in the key so no change necessary to them.

Other things that are possible is that, since the D chord could be borrowed from E Mixolydian, or E Minor, you could potentially try those scales for that chord. Likewise, if the key were C#m, you could try C# Phrygian at that point (2 of those are the same result as just changing D# to D, but one has more changes).

There are other options, because some styles - like blues-based music - don't necessarily stick to diatonic notes and "mix major and minor" - so you could possibly play E Mixolydian over all of these chords. The D note in that scale would sound "bluesy" over the E chord and B chord (even though the B chord has a D# in it, the D natural over it sounds "bluesy") and it will be a b5 over the G#m chord (also a blue note).

But those are things to try after finding out that your "basic scale with alterations as necessary" isn't getting you the sound you want.

IOW, always start with "The piece is in G, so I use G scales for notes".

Because really, the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody are really just drawn from the diatonic pitches.

You can have chromatic melody notes, and you can have chords out of the key, but again usually these have some relation to the key and aren't just random - Secondary Dominants and Borrowed Chords for <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and "embellishing" tones and functional chromaticism for melody (the latter meaning those notes are parts of the chords not in the key).

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>I think one issue with 13 is you set up this C - Eb - D chord motion, and we are conditioned to hear either Db or C next - a continuation of this downward cycle. 

The Em7 chord is kind of nice on its own, but because it's the only one of its type, and it doesn't follow through on our expectations, it sounds out of place.

I'm not sure what the rules for mixed progressions are, and the melody does sort of force you into some rather specific chords if you can only use triads and 7th chords.

It might be worth just trying something like the following - keep as many common tones as you can between chords, so

Am7 - Am7b5 - D7/A - Am7 - Bm/A - Am just to go to a polar opposite and see how the sounds sound to you and if there's anything you can cull from the two approaches that would help you write a new example you like better.

You were only supposed to use chord tones in 14, so the B in your first measure, and the A and D natural are not chord tones in the 2nd measure (and the D should be D flat!).

I think the movement towards measure 6 is partly a "slamming on the brakes". While you do introduce some quarter note movement in measures 2 through 5, they're all the same rhythm. Try doing something like having measure 4 be beats 1 and 4 as quarter notes, and measure 5 be beats 1, 3, and 4 as quarters. That should "gradually slow" to measure 6.

The 16ths in the final measure seem really inappropriate and that repeated last note is never a favorite gesture of mine. You would be better off to recall a rhythmic motive from one of the previous measures, especially since you've come to this final slow down in measure 7 (which really sort of demands a whole note or two half notes on measure 8 - try a couple of variations and see if any float your boat - otherwise if you take one of my suggestions for 4 or 5, try a rhythm more similar to that in the final measure (or leading to the final measure with the final again being just a whole note).

As for Version 2, I agree it's better, but yeah, you were still supposed to use chord tones only (and you used that darn D Natural against the Db again - you ain't Stravinsky yet!!! :-)

Actually, aside from that wrong note and the first measure not being chord tones, my only complaint is the high A in m. 4 - it's also not a chord tone.

I don't know if you've noticed this, but you've got a lot of "connections" in terms of first note of a measure and the next, or last note of a measure and the next!

I really like that the opening C moves down to Bb, and then the next measure begins with a C again. Notice that 2nd C also comes directly from a Bb.

It kind of makes me thing you should try B Natural in m. 4 as it too "connects" to the prior C, or if you should use G, that "connects" to the following F - and here with just a single note, you're kind of locked into it only connecting with one (well, you could have A-B-C or C-B-A but that becomes a little to restrictive given all the other restrictions going on) on either side but I really do like the whole note, so keep that.

You also connect the C and Bb and D and E from last to first in those meausres, and the final E to the final D beat 1 to beat 1. It's kind of something you may have done suboncsiouly but it serves to connect measure to measure, and then "note 1 melody note for the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (often heard as the most important) to note 1 of the next chord in a nice mixture.

So maybe that G or B (or even a repeated E, but IDK) would be a nicer choice than that A, and continue that "gut instinct" you already had.




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well certainly, Timbre is a major factor here.

Instruments with more similar timbre "blend" better. So brass tends to be a little less homogeneous tan Piano or Guitar - or even a string ensemble playing the same chord.

Picking out voices should be the opposite though - it's a little easier in a non-homogeneous group to pick out which instrument is doing what (but, at the same time, it can make finding interior notes more challenging because they do blend into the other notes).

TBH, I tend to hear more of the overall quality rather than individual notes, so what I do is get the outer parts first, then use clues and process of elminiation to get inner parts - like if the top is G and the bottom is C, I'm going to assume the inner part is probably an Eb if the whole thing sounds "minor" to me.

I was actually watching the old James Bond "From Russia with Love" this morning and there's a spot where it's percussion accompanying a Trumpet melody - and there are parts where it seems like it's a unison line then it breaks up into <b><u>harmony</u></b> for only a note here or there, then you start to wonder if you're hearing it all correctly or not!

So I know what you mean - if it were piano, I'd be able to pick that out more easily.

But I think that has more to do with them sounding so similar in that context. Even though the piano sounds similar for each note, there's something about the overall tone quality that makes it sound a little more obvious.

However, I also play piano and guitar, and not Trumpet or brass instruments, so it could be just a matter of experience.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; But Is there even a definition of the Major/Minor system that excludes "modal" thinking?

I'm not quite clear on what you're asking. Sort of, by definition, "Tonality" and "Modality" are two different things, the former being "Major/minor" and the latter "Modal".

A "tonal analysis" is useless for something like a Gregorian Chant. A "modal analysis" is useless for Mozart.

"Eleanor Rigby" or "Norwegian Wood" by The Beatles is a different thing.

&gt;Part of that system is the concept of the modes to describe the scale degrees of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> relative to the tonal center.

I suppose here's the distinction: "Tonality" is about "Key" as a concept which is more than just "the major scale" or "minor scale". Tonal music (that with the capital T, like of the CPP) is "about" establishing Key Centers.

Modality is more about "the mode" - i.s. a little more about the scale itself. When modal pieces "modulate" (not the real term but to draw a parallel) it's more of a focus on a modal degree than a "new key". IOW modal pieces are more likely to establish a mode and stay within that mode, exploring the relationships among different scale degrees within that mode. while tonal pieces tend to be more about relationships among key centers - at least, again in traditional music.

Modern "tonality" (Centrality) kind of blurs those lines and is more a hybrid of the two concepts.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>What you should do is look at other solo instrument pieces and see how they do this. Bach wrote a number of solo instrument works (though the ones for Cello or commonly played on Cello do include chordal parts, but there are still just solo passages as well).

I think there are a number for solo Flute (Recorder) that are totally monophonic.

You should also just play melodies without the chordal accompaniment, and hear how they imply the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and tonality alone. Many of them will do that without the need for accompaniment.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;But say there is a chord progression in A minor

OK.

&gt;The key I have to play in would be A aeolian wich resolves to the following modes

No. The KEY is A Minor. "A Aeolian" is a Mode, not a Key.

It does not "resolve" to any modes. There's no "resolution" at all.

&gt;Now I know I can break the rules and play the relative major.

You could play what you would conceptualize as a C Major *scale* over an Am chord progression, but it's just going to sound like A Minor because the <b><u>harmony</u></b> "over-rides" and scales.

&gt;From research I also saw I can play in the parallel key, which resolves to A major.

Research from where? No, you can't. And it doesn't "resolve". You could play notes from the KEY of A MAJOR over a chord progression in A MINOR but it's not going to sound so hot.

&gt;Am I limited to the notes in this scale or can I use more scales?

You are limited to the notes OF THE KEY. If the chord progression is in A MINOR, then all of the notes in the <b><u>harmony</u></b> have been drawn from the key of A minor, thus all notes for melody should be drawn from the key of A Minor as well.

This seems to be a concept that a lot of people don't seem to get - chords and scales and keys are not different things. The Key contains the notes, from which the scales and chords are made.

If you are playing in A Minor EVERYTHING comes from A minor!

There are a few disclaimers and exceptions, but on the whole, you should use an A Minor Scale over an A Minor Chord Progression. It's as simple as that.

There's no need to talk about any other modes or scales or parallel blah blah blah. A Chord progression in the Key of A Minor takes melody notes from the Key of A Minor. That's it. Walk away and make music.


&gt;I hear some people talking about taking notes from the Chromatic scale, but these contains all the notes from one note to another in the next octave. This doesn't make sense to me.

You can play notes, and chords, from other scales in keys in a piece of music. But you just don't do it willy nilly.

I don't know why you're saying "the next octave" - there are 12 Chromatic pitches. 7 of those, in a certain pattern, create 7 notes scales like A Minor. We call the notes in the key "Diatonic". The remaining 5 notes are "Chromatic". They appear in other Keys and modes and scales. But you don't have to invoke another scale or key to use them - that's a mistake most people make. You can be in A Minor and just use a D# - it doesn't have to "come from" some other scale. It could, but it doesn't have to. It could just be a Chromatic note that's used to embellish a chord or another note.

&gt;However, when looking at this A# note. This is not in the D minor key. But is seen as the augmented 5th as the intervals. Can I still use this note in this key? How does this work? This note is however in the D minor key.

Do not use sites like that. It's wrong.

You're right it's not in D Major (or D Minor - actually, Bb is in Dm, but that's not the problem).

It's in the "key" of E minor. 

That A# (or Bb) is a "blue note" common in rock music.

And it happens all the time.

Blues based music is one of the exceptions I was talking about above.

Usually, if a piece was in E Major, you'd play melodies in E Major.

If the piece was in E Minor, you'd play notes from E Minor.

But, in "Bluesy" sounding music, the b3, b5, and b7 are used as "blue notes". b3 and b7 are already in the Minor Scale, so playing them over minor causes no issues, and the b5 (or #4) is an added note to the scale. But often a minor scale (or more exactly, the minor pentatonic scale, or "minor blues" scale which is a minor pentatonic with that added b5 - the "hexatonic" they mention - but few people actually call it that) is played over an otherwise MAJOR context. It's this "minor over major" that gives it that bluesy feeling.

But you can't just play an E minor scale over an E Major chord progression and have it work - there's more to it than that.

Firstly, you need to forget all of this and learn to play the songs.

You need to pick some easy, basic, songs that pretty much stay in a single key and learn how to deal with that first. "Don't Stop Believin" as much as people may not like it, is in E Major, and so are all the chords, and the very playable Guitar Solo (though it's got one harder fast part to the solo).

It's really hard to learn this stuff when you're starting from every possibility, without having the CORE of MAJOR AND MINOR KEYS first!

Minor actually has it's own tricks to it but everything else is related to the core of Major and Minor Keys. Then it expands out from there. It's like trying to learn Algebra without knowing how to do basic addition and subtraction.

It's actually kind of hard to find music that stays entirely diatonic but a lot of songs at least have large sections. Bluesy' stuff kind of throws a monkey wrench in it, and lot of songs use chords from outside of the key.

But you need to learn how to do the ones in a key first.

Try "Crazy Train"  by Ozzy Osbourne which is in F#m (intro) and A (verses).

"Runaround" by Blues Traveler is in G.

"Disarm" by Smashing Pumpkins is Em. "Time of Your Life" by Green Day is G (tuned down)- but there's a similarity to "Disarm" which is worth learning and understanding. 

"Good One (Coming On)" by Blackberry Smoke is also in G - and shares some similarities with both those songs I just mentioned, but has a guitar solo that's a little more "bluesy". 

"They Don't Write 'em Like That Anymore" by Greg Kihn is a great, typical Am song.

"You Got Lucky" by Tom Petty is in Am, but moves to C for the chorus for a touch.

Try something like "Down on the Corner" by Credence Clearwater Revival, which is C - it's got a guitar lick and the "solo" is also a harmonized version of that lick. See if you can understand how the lick relates to the key.

that should get you started.

HTH

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In relation to your now downvoted comment, you're actually kind of doing the same thing from my perspective! I can't believe you don't know what happens in the RH of a keyboard instrument when doing Conitinuo parts, but you know as much about Basso Conitnuo as you do - so it's all relative my friend!

OK, in Baroque Music, especially a form known as a Trio Sonata, there are 3 written out parts: 2 for melody instruments (traditionally 2 violins, or 2 flutes, etc. or even a mixture) and 1 for the Basso Continuo part, or "the bass line" (Cello, Bassoon, etc.).

The "Continuo Group" consisted of the person playing the bass part as well as an additional musician playing a chordal instrument (Keyboard instrument, Lute, etc.).

This person doesn't really have a written part, but works from the whole score, playing the bass line "as is" and then forming harmonies from what is implied by the upper parts.

Sometimes, the bass line is "figured" (Figured Bass) which means it has numerals and symbols to tell the chordal instrument what the harmonies are. So the written bass part has these figures on it. You see "6" over an F# in the key of D Major, so you know it's a D Major chord in first inversion.

What the chordal instrument player is doing is "realizing" the figured bass.

Now, well-schooled players will do more than just double the bass line and fill in the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - they will often lay off the bass to create a change in texture, or they will more specifically following written melody parts. So the chordal instrument's role is typically improvisatory in that they "enrich the texture harmonically but tastefully" by playing the written bass part as is or leaving it out here and there, and by providing harmonic support based on the figures, the melody parts, or in the absence of figures, just the melody parts, either by doubling elements of them or by improvising harmonies they imply.

What you need to do is "learn how to realize figured bass on a chordal instrument".

But to put it in an oversimplified manner, your LH will play the written bass line, and your RH will improvise chords based on the other parts, or any figures present.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Right - as others have said, not necessarily.

The earliest Western Music was just solely Melody (Gregorian Chant). (Monophony)

They started adding additional melodies, which led to <b><u>harmony</u></b> in counterpoint (Polyphony).

This stayed pretty much the norm for sacred vocal music through the Renaissance and into the Baroque era (Bach's Chorales). Sacred vocal music was preserved so we have plenty of examples, where Instrumental music wasn't really written down as much so we're not as sure how it evolved.

But because of "song" type forms where you'd have a Vocal and accompanying instrument, at some point the accompanying instrument just plays all the other would-be-vocal parts, and then you end up with a tendency towards more "stacked" chords or "Melody plus Accompaniment". (Homophony).

Around the 1600s, when the first operas were written, you get more of what we'd now call an Opera Aria with instrumental accompaniment (Lute, or Consorts, etc).

But they still stayed largely linear through the Renaissance and into the Baroque.

It's probably not really until the rise of Instrumental Music in the Classical Period where Homophony really reaches a point where <b><u>harmony</u></b> is starting to be taken on its own, as "vertical" elements in the music that are no longer dependent on the "horizontal" aspects of each "part" being a melody line.

Probably, the trouble it takes to do fully contrapuntal pieces on Keyboard instruments or worse, Lutes and Guitars, etc. made it somewhat necessary to "verticalify" the <b><u>harmony</u></b> into "chord units" rather than "<b><u>harmony</u></b> by line" but it's a long evolution and happens gradually, and both methods co-exist.

But by the time we get to things like Jazz, it's really mostly chordal accompaniment and players don't even necessarily care to  "connect" chords linearly all the time - true of Rock and Pop chord progressions too. They still tend to co-exist, but I'd say today there's far more (maybe too much) emphasis on Verticality in <b><u>harmony</u></b> such that people are on forums like this thinking "chord progressions" are what makes music than there is on horizonatal aspects of music (but not everything has to be counterpoint either).

So while it would certainly be OK to see early music, and later contrapuntally-derived styles in this way, and even many transitional or passages written in this manner in otherwise mixed method works, it's not necessarily applicable to everything.

But if it helps you transcribe, it's still obviously useful for that!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;My main question is if the harmonizing vocals are all supposed to be in the same key

Absolutely. EVERYTHING in the piece should be from the same key. Melody, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, harmonizations, bass lines. Everything (with rare and specialized exceptions).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hi, this is like saying, "I'd like to learn to cook food and I've looked at recipes on 13 websites and read parts of 2 cookbooks.

Without lighting the fire or turning on the burner.

Or worse, without ever having eaten food! Or any of the food you want to cook!

I agree with u/LukeSniper and u/gravescd - don't learn music from books. Learn music from - wait for it - - - - MUSIC!!!!!!!

You can't learn to swim from reading a book. You need to get in the water and figure out what to do to stay afloat! You can't read a book to learn how to ride a bike. You've got to get on it - and maybe fall off it a few times before you figure it out.

Chords provide <b><u>harmony</u></b>, which is in some ways a "setting" or "canvas" or "backdrop" or whatever for other points of interest - such as a melody - to interact in/with.

These are the kinds of questions that people who learn to play musical instruments (especially chordal instruments) don't typically ask. They just learn to play music and then it's pretty darn obvious.

So me or none of the other posters are trying to put you down or make you feel stupid or anything - you did say you were a beginner - but we're trying to tell you how important it is to learn music from music! Learn to play music, ideally on a musical instrument, and most of these kinds of questions become absolutely clear.

It's not a dumb question or anything, but what we don't want is to see yet another person try to learn music the wrong way, and either just get frustrated and give up, or never realize their full potential, and so on.

Learn songs - the answers are in the music itself!!!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; I would suggest that you are dealing with more complex <b><u>harmony</u></b> than you should be for "trying to learn music theory." Start with super easy, childish stuff, and move up a bit at a time. You didn't start learning to read by reading Nietzsche, or doing math by studying calculus. You start at a sensible point, and gradually build on that.
&gt; 
&gt; By all means, play the songs you like and learn them as well as you can, but don't be afraid to humble yourself and learn theory as it applies to children's songs, classic folk songs, basic blues, rock, classical, etc, and gradually work up. 

Quoting all of that for relevance.

I agree u/eddieleipold - people need to start with things that stay in a single key and understand those first before branching out.

I know that's not always easy because you find a song you like and you don't really know if it's in a single key or not!

Music doesn't have to be in a single key, and what usually makes it "work" is just familiarity of sounds. if you look at Jongtr's response you'll see that there are pretty "normal" reasonings behind these, meaning they are pretty "ordinary" sounds - just put together in a less usual way. So they "work" because they're all sounds we've all heard before plenty of times. But if you've learned "chords come from a key" and find these don't, then it seems like something special is going on. Not really.

And usually, in the absence of a Key, there is often something else that ties the chords together, such as a common note or notes, or chromatic voice-leading, or some other kind of logical voice-leading, or sequence or sequential progression, and so on.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Anyhow, I once asked a respected music professor and composer (from the university I attended) about mental hearing and developing it. In the course of conversation, I asked him if he could mentally hear a 3 part invention - like Bach's. He responded "if it is well written." That strikes me as odd (and did then, too). Why is it not a yes or no thing? 

Well, I would say because he's not really "hearing it". Instead, he's using "clues". For example, I know, sitting here right now, if I write C-E-G on paper and have a chordal instrument play it, it's going to sound good. So that's not "hearing it" or even "mentally hearing it" (though I can mentally "picture" the sound of a major triad like that - because I've played them lots!) but just knowledge that that combination is a common one.

An example of a "clue" one might use the resolution of a note - for example, one might not really necessarily be able to pick out a 7th but on hearing it resolve to the 6 in a 7-6 style movement - it's a very familiar sound. I hear songs all the time on the radio where I can aurally hear the key is established but then I use other "clues" besides sound to help narrow down possibilities. Like it may sound "bluesy" but I know that probably means it's a b3 or b5 instead of just a 2, 3, or 4. So that helps me quickly narrow down the sound it might be. But if someone's trying to write blues and doesn't do it right, or is trying to use 7th chords but doesn't resolve them right, those additional "knowledge" clues go out the window.

So, IOW, if the counterpoint follows the conventions he's familiar with, then he's able to quickly use his mind to confirm what his ears are telling him.

Just as another different example of this - sometimes when I'm sight reading at the piano, I'll do something like come to a cadence and I'm getting behind and I'm not getting all the notes - it jumps from 2 parts to a 4 or 5 note chord all of the sudden and my brain can't switch in real time from 2 to 5 parts. But, my brain does have the ability to go "oh, it's a cadence, so it's going to be V-I in this key" so I play A7 - D and it "sounds OK" - it's not the written voicing specifically, but it's the correct <b><u>harmony</u></b> (and often bass note and melody).

So IOW, i'm using some foreknowledge to help my brain catch up with my fingers. And if you've got muscle memory on top of that....

________





</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; ou were the one who gave me my most recent breakthrough; you were showing me a snippet of a piece by Ravel with some discussion (that I think someone else wrote) of how to hear it. The key takeaway for me was your suggestion of "hearing it against a diatonic framework." I realized I had always been hearing intervallically, and fumbling with that approach. Instead of hearing a series of harmonic and melodic intervals, I began trying to hear degrees of the key, and it seems much more effective.

YES!!! This is the key (pun intended)

When I was just mentioning the T-bone guy who sang the m6 down - well he's not doing that intervallically - he's doing it based on "I'm singing from the root of the chord down to the 3rd of the chord".

That's how I do it too.

That's a HUGE misconception in sight-singing and ear-training and why I cringe every time I see one of the "what song do I associate this interval with" type posts.

Screw that.

&gt;My main audiation practice at this point consists of lots of singing one part and playing another, and increasingly trying to rely on my mind before confirming anything.

This is how you do it!

But another great exercise is to just extract those intervals and do them in abstract form. Play a C, then sing random intervals above it, trying to find all the notes say, from the key of C Major, then C Minor, then both, then all the chromatics, etc.

One of the reasons we rely so heavily on Moveable Do in most of the US (TMK) is because it goes right along with Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - which is also what we generally study.

Bu it's more than just "Do is the tonic". It sets up a relationship between So and Do. And Ti and Do, and I never ever think of a tritone as "Do to Fi" and instead as Fa to Ti or Ti to Fa - because that's how you usually encounter it in the key. Singing a diminished 7th sucks, but in the context of a vii^o7 chord it makes stinking sense (Bach 2 part in Dm).

Syllables with "ee" sounds generally resolve like Leading Tones - so "Fi" to "So" is functionally equivalent to Ti to Do in a V/V to V progression.

Syllable with an "ay" sound do the same as 7th of a V7/? chord - "Te" resolves to "La" as the 7th in V7/IV resolves to the 3rd of the IV chord.

So these connections between tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> and "tonal solfege" are so important as even the syllable sounds are largely consistent. It makes the system more elegant and when you can hear "Re-Fi-Do to Ti-So-Re as a V7/V to V it makes a lot more sense than just "major 3rd to tritone to m2, etc.

It's chord tones, key tones, resolutions, and all that jazz!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'll go the other way - none of the above!

USE THE NOTES OF THE KEY!!!!!!

The arpeggios on each chord, a pentatonic scale, and any modes (that are rotations of the key) are just THE NOTES OF THE KEY!!!

Consider them "specific subsets" that can be used as a pattern that restricts you to a certain set of notes - which can be useful, but you don't have to be locked into a "scale".

Instead, think NOTES - and how they relate both to the key, and the chord at hand.

Chord is a Dm7 in C? Well, what is a B in relation to that?

It's scale degree 7 in the key - and it's the M6 (Dm6, or Dm13) in relation to the chord.

Playing C Major Pentatonic isn't going to get you that note. Playing Dm Pentatonic isn't going to get you that note. Playing a Dm7 arpeggio isn't going to get you that note.

But as a passing tone between A and C, it makes perfect sense - because it comes from the key (one could argue that it "comes from" D Dorian or just C Major, but you're not playing a whole scale - just a note in between two other notes).

IOW, improvising should not - at least on the whole - be about "playing scales" or "arpeggios" - those are useful tools for getting specific sounds, but it should be about playing MELODICALLY and even MOTIVICALLY (IMHO).

Obviously as you become more advanced, you can use more chromatic notes, and limit sets to specific pitches for specific effects, but the biggest mistake I feel most people make is getting so hung up on scales and ignoring the most obvious thing that's right in front of you - play the notes from the key - that's where the melody and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> originally came from (excluding any out of key chords or modulations of course, which are common in jazz so you do have to learn to deal with them).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, I understand what you want to do, and how you want to do it. But, there's a little bit of a problem here. We live in a time where people can just use something like Garageband to make music without really knowing what they're doing.

I see lot of people get a DAW and try to do this, and while they might be able to use some pre-made loops that sound OK, it's all trial and error and very time-consuming, and they don't learn anything from one song they make to be able to apply it to another song they make.

The real answer to your question is:

Step 1. Learn to play music by other people.

IOW, you need to learn to do a lot more before you'll be able to successfully write a 3-4 minute pop song.

Now, that shouldn't stop you from trying! You do need to learn how to do it.

But I think a lot of people think - especially with things like GB, that they're going to be able to make a #1 pop hit the first time they use it.

No. You have to "practice" using a DAW, just like you do a musical instrument. You have to "practice" writing songs just like you do a musical instrument.

Are you ready for the concert stage after 3 months of lessons? Probably not.

After 3 months of trying to write music, you aren't going to have any "great" songs probably.

Generally speaking, most people can only write at the level they can play, and maybe a little bit beyond.

So if all you can do is plunk out 3 chords on a piano, you can't expect to write complex jazz harmonies - essentially, you don't know enough about them!

&gt;How do i: Make a cool drum pattern that doesn't just loop through the whole song.

Short answer - use different loops. Delete parts of them every so often so there's some sections without drums, or with only a bass drum, and so on.

Long answer, learn about drum patterns and how they're made.

&gt;Add in some keyboard and maybe even guitar.

Well, you'll have to learn those instruments. There are of course loops for those as well. You can learn to write "simplistic" music using a controller keyboard and trial and error, and keyboard sounds in DAWs can generally sound totally professional. Guitar sounds leave a lot to be desired but if you can record in real guitar, it will sound much better - but that's another stage in the whole learning process.

If you can play power  chords, and a basic punk song, then you can probably come up with your own chords and record your own song on guitar this way.


&gt;And have it all organized and sounding good.

Well, that again comes from learning what others do and have done. You need to use existing music as a reference point - as a model - you can't just guess at how to do everything or else it will sound unorganized and bad. You mentioned you kind of understand time signatures - well you need to really understand them. And understand Rhythm, Melody, and <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, and understand how drum patterns are made, and how bass patterns are made, and how melodies are made, and how chords are made.

This sounds like a lot - and it is - but for simplistic music like you often hear on the radio a lot of times, it can be done in a reasonable amount of time. But remember a lot of people learn an instrument around 10 or 12 or so, and play through middle and high school, and then sort of hone their chops as a young adult, and that's the age a lot of people get picked up to be recording artists. You don't have to go that route because now we can self publish, but there's so much competition out there that - yeah - just one long loop that loops through the song doesn't really do much to differentiate you from the rest of the herd.

That's why it's imperative, if you want to distinquish yourself, to learn music from ans many influences as possible. Learn the songs, tear them apart and figure out how they work, steal the ideas, and put them back together. That's what all the musicians do.

This guy has a lot of videos that break down separate parts to a lot of classic synth songs (New Wave) and even though he's using a lot of period hardware and reproductions, most of these, if not all, and more, techniques are available in modern DAWs:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjHBSChij-0

And how he learned to do this is by breaking down those original songs and figuring out how they worked. That's a lot of trial and error too but nowadays we have a lot of tutorials like this that he didn't have when he was learning.

Taking lessons to learn to play an instrument - especially a chordal instrument like keyboard and/or guitar is a step in the right direction for this - the more you learn to play, the easier it will be to figure things out - the more times you encounter the same basic idea in a bunch of songs, the more you realize "oh, this is how songs are made" - but you have to have that reference point - the music itself. Immerse yourself in it, learn to play it, break it apart, read about it, watch vids on techniques and so on.

It's kind of like, you saying "I want to write a 10 stanza poem" without having learned grammar, or the language very well, or what poems are even made up, or what rhyming is, or a couplet, or rhyme scheme, or poetic meter, and so on. You can't really write a Limerick if you've never seen/heard a Limerick before, and you have to see enough of them to know what's common and what's not, and you have to learn enough about them to understand how the lines are structured, and so on.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Some of the answers are kind of right, but there's a little clarification needed.

In a MAJOR key, "blue notes" are b3, b5 and b7.

(note, really it's more of a Mixolydian mode, since most people are going to be adding b7 to the I chord, but people just generically refer to it as a major blues).

If you play a **minor** Pentatonic scale, it gives you b3 and b7. If you play what many people refer to sometimes as "the" blues scale, or "pentatonic minor blues scale" that adds the b5 as well.

However, in actual blues music, it's actually not uncommon to add b3 and b7 (and even b5) to a **MAJOR** pentatonic scale.

Playing C Minor Pentatonic over a C7 I chord in a "major blues" is sort of the "lifehack" way of getting those blue notes (b3 and b7, and b5 if you include it).

It's kind of an over-simplified and maybe "too scalar" way of looking at things. However, at this point, so many people have approached it this way that it sound fine and is quite common.

But maybe more of a "purist" or a "seasoned" blues player would more likely play something akin to C Mixolydian (over a C Mixolydian blues, imagine that!) again adding the b3 and even the b5.

This yelds:

Cm Pent:

C - Eb - F - (Gb) - G - Bb - C

C Mix with blue notes:

C - D - Eb - E - F - (Gb) - G - A - Bb

You could also say you could play C Dorian:

C - D - Eb - F - (Gb) - G - A - Bb - which again gives you the b3 blue note but not the natural 3 - and many see that b3 to n3 move an important aspect of "true" blues.

Some people have called what's going on the "Composite Blues Scale" because it essentially takes Cm Pent and C Pent and adds them together, which basically gives you Mix with the b3:

Composite Blues Scale:

C - D - Eb - E - F - (Gb) - G - A - Bb - C

Now, here's the catch:

A - C - D - Eb - E - G - "A Minor Blues" right? Look for those notes in the composite blues scale. Do you see them?

But, conceptually speaking, it's still "in C" so "really" what you're doing is playing a C MAJOR PENTATONIC, but with an added b3 blue note:

C - D - Eb - E - G - A

Which is really just a subset of the CBS - and since the "composite" part of the CBS is C Major Pent and C Minor Pent, they are BOTH subsets, as is the "a minor blues scale with it's b5, which is really the C Major pent with added b3) and Mixolydian, and Dorian as well.

___________

&gt;Does it make sense to think of blues as a simple melody that frequently alternates between major and parallel minor

Well maybe not that "frequently alternates", but "with notes that can be drawn from either".

It is quite common for example to play, say, a Cm Pent over the I chord, and then change to C Major pent over the IV chord. But it's also common to do the reverse - C Major pent over the I chord (though usually including the b3 or a bend from it, hint at it, etc.) and then C minor pent over the IV chord.

But it's also common just to use Cm pent over the whole thing (again, sort of "simplified" way to do it).

But it's also very common - especially in "real" blues, or jazz, etc. to use the m3 over the I chord, and the b3 over the IV chord, while otherwise keeping the remainder of notes in use from Major (C pent major).

And the only way to really explain this is not that they're using just one scale, but using some scale with a variable 3rd depending on the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or even transposing the scale - which brings us to yet another valid possibility:

Use Cm pent over the I chord, but **F**m pent over the IV chord!

Or, another common strategy for the "enlightened" is to use the C CBS over the I chord and **F** CBS over the IV chord - this is often a literal transposition (check out "Cruella De Vil" from the original 101 Dalmations Disney animated film).

So even "using C CBS over the entire chord progression in C" is an oversimplification.

Because:

______

Music is not really about "playing scales". It's about playing notes. Scales are just a way for us to classify and categorize the things, and put into patterns we can draw from. And I'm not trying to say we shouldn't use them, but rather than a "scales first" kind of thinking, most "enlightened" (let's call them) players actually take a "notes first, scales second" kind of approach.

In the key of C, in a blues, "Eb" is a blue note. It doesn't matter which scale it comes from. It's that regardless of the scale. All "playing a scale" does is limit the notes for you. You can get that note - and some other good-sounding ones, from just playing Cm Pent Blues.

But playing Cm Pent Blues is not going to get you that Eb to En move - NONE of these scales are going to provide that - except the CBS, which isn't truly a scale at all, but a collection of notes to help show the way the music is conceptualized - not a scale to just run over the chords in the key.

____

There are "minor blues" and they generally tend to stick to minor pent (or minor pent blues) but they also may be Dorian as well.

Minor blues pretty much avoid the n3 at all costs. However, they embrace the n6 (from major if you like). So much so in some cases even the IV chord is a Major chord in a minor blues, making it a "Dorian Blues" or Dorian Vamp. "Evil Ways" and "Oye Coma Va" both by Santana do this.

A lot of older Jazz minor blues like those common in Gypsy Jazz use the m6 chord as the Tonic - so Cm6 (which has the A - n6 in it) so it takes Dorian, or again minor pent (blues) - which doesn't have the 6th note in that scale so it doesn't matter!

And that brings up an important final point - Pentatonic scales (not counting the b5 addition) are really just "subset" scales that quickly provide "good sounding notes" for you - in Major Blues and Minor Blues, the Minor Pentatonic (even with b5) is going to sound "bluesy".

But if the minor uses a "dorian" sound on I or IV, then aspects of Major (or Dorian - n6) come into play.

In in a Major Blues, it can become more complex because of the variability of b3 or n3 - which come from minor or major scales, but whether you include n6 or b7, or both, depends on how many notes you want to include!

And then on the IV, and V chord, other things can happen!!!

______

This is all "theory" and that may "explain" what's going on at least in some grasp-able way, but the truth is, to understand it fully, the best thing to do is learn to play as many songs as you can! That will make far more sense to you. "A sound is worth a thousand words" in that respect.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Couple of things to consider:

Locrian can be seen as two IDENTICAL tetrachords elided:

B C D E, then E F G A

this can be used to your advantage.

Clarification: Locrian is not a "Gregorian Mode" per se and Gregorian Chant didn't have <b><u>harmony</u></b>, so there's no "i^o " to be concerned about from that perspective.

Locrian wasn't really recognized until after Glareanus, at which point the Locrian mode was added for "completeness" with no real precedent in actual music (there are a few examples of plagal modes that have the range that makes them look like Locrian, but the name didn't exist at the time AFAIK).
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>David,

I'm not sure why you did what you did in the accompaniment at the beginning.

Usually, one might pretty consistently have "full triads" on beats 2 and 3, and the primary reason for not having them is when a necessary note (especially one you don't want to double) is in the melody, so it's  left out of the accompaniment.

So you have an F# melody note in m.1, and typically that's where the A# would be included in the chord on beat 2 - you didn't.

In m.2, when the melody drops to C#, you also drop off the A#.

I think, maybe you were trying to go for a little counter melody in that upper note of those chords, but the move from F# to C# in m.2 really kind of obscures that. So I think I see what you were going for but it's like you did it the opposite way of what you "should" have (hey, it's your piece you can do what you want of course!).

I would just encourage you to try it the opposite way - that way the "melodic" upper note of the beat 2 and 3 triads would be moving opposite of the melody note's direction, which provides a nice counterpoint and won't obscure the secondary melody like in m. 2.

Or of course the other thing is just to use the full triad on both beats as you do in other places (when the chord on beat 3 changes).

A good example for you to consider is m. 17 - which has the A# on both beats 2 and 3 - you probably wouldn't leave it off there because the F# <b><u>harmony</u></b> might sound too empty or too "open 5th-y" sounding. Same is true of those other spots where the A# is missing.

So if the A# is not in the melody (3rd of the chord in the melody) I wouldn't leave it off of the accompaniment chord in many cases.

Something to try, or consider, and see if you like it any better or not.

____

I'm not seeing/hearing any inversions (am I? - actually, I just scanned back through and it looks like everything is Root Position - you're missing out on a LOT of potential melodic motion and forward drive in the bass!).

See, a alternate solution to what I just said, and piggybacking on what u/D4ruth says about the octaves on beat 1 being tedious - m.2 should just have an A# in the bass for example.

______


It's not bad at all. I don't find it too boring honestly (and I have a short attention span!) but it is kind of "lacking in interest". I'm always about more textural variety -  you've got some nice changes in register, and the return to the A material with the sudden piano after the build is nice. There are some changes to other chords of emphasis, so I don't feel like it has to be "Chopin" and go through 20 keys or be ultra-chromatic or whatever, but I do feel it needs some "relief" in some way. It's kind of that typical build build build until you hit the return of the A, but it doesn't "breathe" as well as it could if that makes sense.

But you hear stuff like this all the time so I mean, bravo, it's good work and well thought out. Just seems like you have the talent to make it even better if you open yourself up to more inversions, sectional differentiation, and so on.

Yeah, definitely, study the music of others more deeply - it seems you've got a good handle on the surface elements, and can now just start to get into the deeper layers and explore them.

Thanks for sharing your piece!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; I thought I did. In the second half of the second measure of line 4. This is actually an area I wasn't sure about. I wasn't sure if we were still in the key of A at this point or if we had modulated to the key of E. I analyzed it in both contexts, as best I could.
&gt; 

Oh, yeah, I forgot because it was up in the beams!

This is actually pretty tricky. Usually we would say because it cadences in E, it has modulated to E (and the bit before it is clearly E)

&gt;Regardless, I think I get your point: there's more to analysis than simply naming the chord. But I guess I feel, at my current level of skill, naming the chord is all that is in my power to do. In this situation, we had two different options for naming the <b><u>harmony</u></b> in question; both options were backed by an equal number of chord tones. I know I will encounter this situation again. How can I learn to choose which option is the best in situations like these?

So you look for a couple of things.

The "general rule" is, if it's more than a few chords long, and cadences in the new key, and continues in the new key, then it is a modulation.

The most common type of modulation is called a "common chord" or "pivot chord" modulation where one chord can play "dual roles" and be "in both keys at once".

Usually this chord is preceded by a chord definitively in the old key and not in the new key, and followed by a chord in the new key and definitely not in the old key.

This can be a bit tricky because sometimes you can have something like a B chord, which could be both V/V in A, or just V in E. So usually we pick the "simpler" option.

In the 4th system, the first chord is E, but if you notice it has that D natural, which makes it E7. Now, it *could* be V7/IV in the key of E, but it makes more sense to consider it as V7 in A, followed by I in A. 

Then we have V7/V in A, or V in E.

So really, the E7 "can't be" in E, and the B7 "can't 

be" in A, so it must be the A that is the pivot chord, because it can be both (again, this is the least messy option).

So your analysis where the key of E starts is pretty good, but usually what we'd do is back up 1 chord and call the A chord "I" in A, and IV in E, kind of stacking the numerals as you did, but there's no need to continue past where that B7 is because the rest of the line is all pretty much in E with a confirmation cadence at the end of the line on E.

FWIW, Late Renaissance and Early Baroque music can be a little more tricky because of sequential progressions, lingering modal influence, and a kind of "shifting" between modality and tonality as the system was still evolving. So it can be kind of hard to pin some of these things down.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Aldwell/Schcacter's text uses "Case Insensitive".

Here is C Major:

I II III IV V VI VII

Here is C Minor

I II III IV V VI VII

!

They have to give you the mode (major or minor) first, and then expect you to know the quality of the chord based on that.

IIRC, Walter Piston's "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>" text does the same thing.


</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>&gt;The analysis on the trombone line feels clunky and incorrect. 

It is.

&gt;Trying to get better at analyzing what I write and would be very appreciative of any help. 

OK, firstly, you need to spell things correctly.

The 2nd chord should be Fb, not E. It would have been better if you had an Ab Key Sig or if it was to stay in C like this, a lot more cautionary accidentals. All of the b9 notes are mis-spelled except those on the G chords. Eb7b9 should have an Fb, Bb7b9 should have a Cb. Ab7b9 should have a Bbb.

I - bVI - V/vi - vi | V/V - V7b9 - I - V7b9/V | - note, I'm not sure why you're putting "V/V" on the V chord of the key. This happens again at the end with G7 - that's just plain old V in the key of C.

Here's where things get a bit tricky, but like Fb is a chord borrowed from the parallel minor:

Gbadd9 is just bVIIadd9 (from Abm)

Ebm7 is just v7 (from Abm)

Ab7b9 is V7b9/IV
 
Now this would all imply a potential move to Db, and could all be seen as IV - ii7 - V7b9 in Db.

But since you never go there, or replace the Db with a sudden F chord, the modulation is never solidified.

So at best, those chords are IV/IV, ii7/IV, and V7b9/IV, but since they're pretty justifiable as mode mixture in Ab, there's no real need to invoke Db. You could say it's all a IV - ii - V of IV.

But using "IV of IV" and things like that gets a bit sketchy.

Case in point, the next thing - IV/iii would just be silly. That's like coming up with a name just to call it something - when we get to that level we might as well just analyze all modulations as being in C or something!

F is V/ii in Ab (or if we were insistent on Db, V/vi).

But again, it doesn't resolve where it should.

Which is why this is more of a direct modulation.

We can find a common chord if we look for one. But it's not really how a pivot chord modulation typically works.

And with the abundance of b9 chords and the progressions you have, you're really not in the world of CPP <b><u>harmony</u></b> anymore anyway, so aside from your practicing analysis, all it's going to tell you is the writing is suspect :-)

What I mean to say is, when the analysis gets this tricky, chances are you're outside of the stylistic norms of CPP music, and a CPP analysis isn't going to be very informative.

If you want to practice analysis, I'd say do it on established pieces by well-known composers to "practice" a bit more.

But you don't need to analyze what you write. Write it because it sounds good to you and let someone else analyze it. The analysis is unimportant - it's going to tell you little to nothing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, this is something that irks me about the way people talk about tonality and atonality, and functional and non-functional chords, and so on.

**In the style of music for which these concepts were devised** a "I7" can NOT have Tonic function.

Also, in that style, chords like "11ths" don't exist.

Also, in that style, function is based on **context**, not what notes are in a chord.

We do not say that an Em7 has a "Dominant" function in C just because it has G-B-D in it. It doesn't work like that.

And traditionally, Atonality implies lack of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

This is, on a simple level, "a wrong chord". It's not something you'd even encounter in tonal music or functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Unless of course, one changes the definition of those terms. It could appear in a quasi-tonal context in a Jazz piece for example, but its function - if any - will still be dependent on the context in which it appears.

There is no inherent function to any chord.

It has to be put in the context of a Key (which again, implies tonality) and music.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;if i have chords created from A melodic minor and simultaneously have a melody from A melodic minor, firstly will this sound good

As Jongtr points out, there's no such thing traditionally as "the key of" A Melodic Minor.

But people do use it (a la Jazz Minor) and when you do, yes that's exactly what you do - your melody notes and <b><u>harmony</u></b> notes are all drawn from the same pool - in this case, melodic minor.

Making music sound good is obviously more than just using the right notes. You have to use them in the right order too...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Kostka/Payne, Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> primarily
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"good" is subjective.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> is just used as a general word to mean notes sounding together - not necessarily "harmoniously" so not all harmonies sound "good" and intentionally so.

At one point in history, people thought harmonies we think sound "good" sounded really bad. So there's not only a continuum within harmonies, but across musical styles and history as well.

So part of it is cultural and subjective, and conditioned.

But many ascribe to a belief that notes that are in lower ratios to each other "sound better" to us, thus a frequency that is 2x another frequency is a simple ratio of 2:1, and that is considered "consonant".

3:2, 4:3, and so on

Once the numbers start getting higher, or less related to each other (or are not whole numbers) we consider them to be dissonances.

For example, 9:8 is considered a "dissonance".

But, a dissonance doesn't have to sound "bad" per se - it's all about the context it appears in.

When we start talking about harmonies with multiple notes, it becomes far more complex.

ut the simple answer is yes, it has to do with the relationship between two frequencies (wavelength and frequency are co-dependent) and the simpler that relationship is as described mathematically, the "more good" the notes sound together.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;What might I call them in standard Roman numeral notation?

Bob? Fred?

I mean, Steely Dan infamously called some chords they didn't really know the name of "Mu Major".

I don't know why you're really concerned about it. Who cares what someone calls them.

I'm just thinking of the last 2 chordal pieces I wrote, and never once has it crossed my mind what Roman Numeral they are. In fact, sometimes I don't even worry about what it might be called. I mean, if it's a Dmaj7 chord, sure, I know it's Dmaj7, but if it's a quartal chord or whole tone chord (which happened in each of the last two pieces respectively) I'm not sitting around even remotely worried about what the name for the chord might be.

Let some other joker figure that out!

Thinking back, I think it's pretty rare that I ever worry about what Roman Numeral a chord is.

There are definintely some where I might think "this is acting like a tonic and this is acting like a dominant" and certainly more "pop" oriented pieces where there's a definite chord progression that I might have to shout out to a bass player or keyboard player so they can follow along - but those are generally basic chord that I can name or number. Anything more than that I'm going to give them notation.

In fact, one thing that really rubs me wrong is when so many people go "what's the name for this chord" and they're trying to come up with some very specific voicing that if you just put "G7sus4" is never going to get played. You want specific notes, write them down. Otherwise, it's jazz and they can play whatever they want, and will even replace your chord with something they think is better.

I think the "principle" of what you're doing is basically "added note chords" or what was called a long time ago "wrong note <b><u>harmony</u></b>" (back in Stravinksy's earlier compositions) but I've also heard it called Pandiatonicism, which means using notes of the diatonic set, but not as traditional tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>. So basically "passing tones" and "neighbor tones" and so on sort of become chord tones and make these "added note" stacks that don't sound too horrible because we're used to these sounds, but still are a little bit different from what we're used to. But there aren't really names for them per se - though something has to be made up if you do printed music (which usually doesn't really do them justice).

B-C#-E would be a Bsus2sus4 

and

A-C#-D would be an Aadd4 (though add11 would be the more accepted form).

Really, like quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, we need a better system for these.

B^2-5 and A^4-5 for example.

Or B^2-4 if we were going to use things like B^b2-4 for B-C-E...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Great points! For your last one, I just literally used to write down the letters! 

I don't think there is any widely accepted way to refer to them - aside from what jazz symbols we have. Without seeing the context, it looks like you're apply "added note <b><u>harmony</u></b>" as it's called, but that doesn't help you with the numerals (though some just pick the overall chord feel and go with that number - if it's an A with added X Y and Z, they just call it an A).

So I think you're going to just have to go back to point 3, and come up with something you know works for you!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The responses you've gotten are accurate, though you should know you will sometimes find a 7th chord without the 3rd. It's generally rare in comparison though.

The absence of a note doesn't really affect things too much if the *implication* of <b><u>harmony</u></b> is strong enough and the context is clear.

Obviously, if you hear a V7 with all notes, then one with no 5th, then one with no 3rd, then one with neither the 3rd or 5th! Your ears and brain will still hear it as a V7 chord.

This can actually be used to one's advantage and sometimes in two part writing you actually may get only the root and 7th, or the 3rd and 7th - and the latter one still implies a V7 rather than a vii^o because traditionally the vii^o would be in first inversion.

Play a G chord, then play a single F note below the highest G, then go to a full C chord with that F moving to the E.

I think you'll hear that even by itself, the F note is strong enough to "turn the G chord into G7" even though it doesn't happen within the chord.

So because the context is so strong in otherwise "normal" circumstances (like V7 to I at a cadence) a missing note isn't going to cause the end of the world! - In fact, in classical music, the 5th is often left off of the final I chord as well! Sometimes it's even just the Tonic note!!!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If your melody is in F Major, then everything is in F Major. Your bass line, your harmonies - should all come from F major - or at least, primarily from F major.

Same is true if your melody is F Minor - your other notes that you use for bass lines and harmonies will come primarily (if not exclusively) from F Minor.

You can use chords, or bass notes, or even melody notes from outside of the key, but generally speaking, music is written in KEYs.

You write in the KEY OF F MAJOR - and then EVERYTHING - EVERY NOTE - melody, bass, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, etc. will come from the KEY OF F MAJOR.

That's where you start.

If you want to do other things, fine, but everyone really needs to understand how to write in a single key as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, to be more specific:

&gt;I can hardly improve on Willi Apel in his Harvard Dictionary of Music: a cadence is "A melodic or harmonic formula that occurs at the end of a composition, a section, or a phrase, conveying the impression of a momentary or permanent conclusion." 

Thus, it can be ONE chord (or even note for that matter). So from that standpoint wikipedia is and I am wrong. However, traditional named cadences, common ones - are two chord "formulas" - Authentic, Plagal, Deceptive, and Half, which are all two chord formulas except the last, which maybe be stated as ?-V, but it is sometimes listed as just moving to V, or even any other non-tonic <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Cadence of 3 or more chords are "whacked" already, just by not meeting the common definition of cadence.

And far too many people confuse "cadence" (as in cadential formula) with "progression" so opening it up to "more than two" is opening up too many cans of worms.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes and no.

This is actually a huge topic that has to do with the way music evolved, but let's say that the whole 4-Part thing is kind of over-rated. It's not that it's not important, but there's so much emphasis placed on it that it seems to be more prevalent, or more important than it really is comparatively speaking.

4-Part <b><u>harmony</u></b> really grew out of Renaissance Vocal Polyphony, where you had 4 parts - Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass, all "singing a different melody" and thus we have counterpoint/polyphony. There were of course 2, 3, and 5+ voice polyphony pieces as well.

The focus on 4 part probably comes largely from the study of Bach Chorales in Theory Courses - and part of that has to do with the consistency of style in which they're written, which is easy to cull rules from.

Really, 4-part <b><u>harmony</u></b> - and polyphony in general - which fugues are a form of (fugues can be in any number of parts but 3 and 4 are probably the most common overall) became passé in the Classical Era, and they're more a part of the Baroque Era that preceded it, and even Renaissance before that.

There are of course Fugues and 4 part pieces written in the Classical Era, but there was a shift in focus to "Melody with Accompaniment"

So we call the "4 Equal Parts" or "4 melodies at once" Polyphony, and in the case of Fugues and imitative forms, Polyphonic Counterpoint.

The "melody with accompaniment" is called "Homophony" - which is an odd word because it sounds like the parts would be homogeneous - equal, but really it means that the accompanimental "voices" kind of subsume into a "chordal" role, where the melody stands out and the other parts don't act so much as individual parts anymore, but as "vertical structures" or at least notes that are dependent on each other.

Of course there's an evolution here, and grey area, and a continuum - people like Mozart shifted between these techniques freely even within the same piece or section of a piece.

But as a general rule, 4-Part (or other various parts) Polyphony gave way to Homophony through the Baroque period where there was kind of a transitional era.

Naturally, the Orchestration approaches differ as well. Baroque music does tend to follow more of a SATB layout with the Soprano member of each family taking the top part, and so on down the line.

In Classical Era Orchestration, you're more likely to get Violins playing the melody, while the rest support, and if Oboes are present, they'll just "fill out the <b><u>harmony</u></b>" a lot of times - not taking the Soprano and Alto parts like they might have in the Baroque.

When we get to the Romantic Period, Orchestration starts to become more about "color" and timbre, and while certainly 4 part (and everything else) writing still exists, things can be done just for color.

I think one problem is, most people associate "Orchestration" with the behemoth Romantic Period style - Mozart and Haydn don't even have full woodwind sections in their orchestras (except for maybe Haydn's last one, or a few exceptions here and there) and Beethoven famously hadn't been including Trombones until the final movement of Symphony 5.

So the way people think of "Orchestration" today is VERY Romantic Period biased.

_____

Of course, it depends on what you mean by "more complex" symphonies and so on, but if you look at Haydn's earliest symphonies, you can see pretty easily that a lot of things are just 2 part counterpoint - the 1st and 2nd violins play the upper part, and the violas and celli play the lower part (bass not always included at that point, but would double cello).

Taking a smaller form piece - Haydn's Piano Trios - the early ones the Cello just basically doubles the Bass part in the Piano - though it would have more likely been Harpsichord or Fortepiano at the time - and this is a direct descendant of the Baroque Trio Sonata and figured bass style.

Honestly, the best way to figure this stuff out is to take orchestral scores, and reduce them, and figure out what's going on. Composers have their own personal orchestration styles, and then there are general trends within stylistic periods - or even certain types of pieces.

I think we can say as a general rule that 4-part <b><u>harmony</u></b> becomes sort of the "preferred" approach through the Baroque period, but with the rise of Monody (a form of Homophony) greater emphasis is placed on a Soprano/Bass framework, with inner voices (of however "parts" needed) do the job of "filling in" the <b><u>harmony</u></b> in much the same way we have 1 or 2 melody instruments in something like a Trio Sonata (2 melody), a written bass line, and then the inner parts aren't written, they're just improvised.

That style leads more directly to Symphonies and String Quartets and so on - follow the 2 Violin sections in a Symphony or Quartet and you'll likely see the 1sts and 2nds constantly trading parts and changing roles - so neither of them is the "Soprano" per se. And the Violas may play the role of "Alto" and Cello "Bass" in a 3 part texture, or Cello may play the role of Bass, Viola Tenor, 2nd Alto, and 1sts Soprano if they do 4 part (the French name for Viola is "Alto" and Cello, when it goes high, reads Tenor clef, so what's that tell you!).

So there's less of a strict "top down" SATB distribution in Homophonic pieces and Classical works in general, except when they might specifically be playing a Chorale type section of Fugal section.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; what can you compose using four part voice leading, or how can you apply it?

Derivative music?

:-)

Let's say this: 4-Part writing - as you learn studying Bach-style Chorale-type works - is a TOOL that you can use to achieve a certain sound.

It gives you all of the notes of a chord, and since there's an extra part, a doubling, or in the case of 7th chords, possibly all 4 notes. In 3-part <b><u>harmony</u></b>, it's more likely due to contrapuntal rules - which this type of writing evolved from - to have to leave off some chord tones. So 4-part writing kind of solves that issue.

Thus what it does is produce a very "consistent" sound and texture. Again, since it evolved from counterpoint, there's also a nice balance between the horizontal aspects (melody of each line) and vertical aspects (<b><u>harmony</u></b>) and because counterpoint strives to "balance" motion in one part against another, there's this overall consistency of range and register too. And a lot of all this evolved from the fact it was originally for voices, and all of this makes it easier to sing and sing well (stay in tune, find your notes, etc.).

It also allows for a continuum of Homorhythmic textures (were all of most of the parts move in the same rhythm - so more "chordal") to fully Polyphonic and Imitative/Contrapuntal textures (where it's more "line based" - like a Fugue) which maintain this consistency of sound and texture, with still a good balance of line and chord on average (though those textures just mention obviously are on opposite ends of the spectrum).

Even when we get into Homophony, the Soprano/Bass framework is still often contrapuntal in nature and helps keep this registral and textural balance, and the inner voices lose a little of their individual independence, but almost become a 3rd "element" in the texture.

And this "consistency of sound" is something Composers in these eras liked and strove for.

The rise of a more melody-based texture meant of course that it's more the accompaniment that becomes a "setting" over which the melody can play the main character. So there's more of a "break" in the roles the parts play but at the same time, some of this 4-part (or just polyphonic writing in general) finds its way into the accompanying parts and provides a "consistency of sound" the melody can sit on top of.

But the trick here is, if you want to write something like a Mozart Piano Sonata Movement, you don't really use 4 part writing.

Some might argue that some of it "is" or at least "owes a strong debt to" 4 part writing but at the same time, it's not the same thing!

Take a look at this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEW0QGQW48

You can clearly see a "melody" with an accompaniment - the Alberti Bass. Again, some might argue that you can take the low, medium, and high notes of the Alberti part, and collect them into a "stack" of ATB with the melody playing the role of Soprano.

But what happens on page 2? Is either the alto or tenor just resting?

Something else to notice about this style is that, usually when you learn 4 part writing it's in the form of Chorale style where there's a different chord each beat. Here, we get the same <b><u>harmony</u></b> for a measure or more sometimes. It's a completely different way of writing.

Here, on the other hand is a later piece, that is definitely more a "chorale style" and if you remove all of the octave doublings, I think you would find a more traditional 4 part (though on piano composers will often intermix 3, 4, 5 parts, etc.) underpinning:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5IE0Eh2APE

What can be really informative is to find pieces for piano, and see how they were orchestrated - Ravel's orchestrations of Mussorgsky are a common starting point (Pictures at an Exhibition).

Likewise, reductions of orchestral works that show you what the "framework" is are helpful too.

Piano Concertos can be really instructive as well because you can compare similar music scored for piano, versus scored for orchestra and see how the composer dealt with it.
________

TBH though, it's not 1770 anymore. It's 2018. While there are certainly plenty (maybe too much) of styles that still rely on multi-part writing principles (vocal harmonies in a pop song, horn sections in pop songs) there are also plenty of things that don't (parallel harmonies in Sax Soli sections, or pop vocals that just run parallel harmonies) and "classical" music has long since moved on.

If you want to write like Bach, or maybe, even Chopin in that example, then 4 part writing could be very useful.

And I'm not saying you shouldn't study it.

But just as much, if not more time needs to be spent on other things - like the Counterpoint you're going into - but definitely "post-Baroque" principles (which are generally neglected) and on through the present.

So I think it's better again to see 4 part writing as a "tool" and great for getting a "consistency of sound" in that older style, but the PRINCIPLES can still be used in modern contexts for those same purposes.

Some people just fall in love with counterpoint and just want to write Bach style Fugues for pleasure. More power to them.

But really, we've kind of moved beyond that now. Still good to know, but IMHO not to the detriment of the other stuff you should know too - which you'll get to in your courses. But again, I think the emphasis on 4 part writing is largely a convenience for us, the instructors, because it gives us more objective measures we can grade you on ;-)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Kostka/Payne's "Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" does cover these topics.

However, unless you can find one used, as a college text, it's textbook prices!

Really, any college level text would be reasonable, though each author has different approaches - so it's actually good to read a number of them as they all help reinforce each other.

Robert Gauldin's Harmonic Practice in Tonal Music

Marvin/Clendenning's Musican's Guide to Theory and Analysis

Aldwell/Schachter's <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and Voice Leading

then getting older and not used as much in the classroom anymore:

Walter Piston's <b><u>Harmony</u></b> (though there are recent updated editions)

Arnold Schoenberg's <b><u>Harmony</u></b>

Many of Percy Goetschius's books are out of copyright and available online and while a little old-fashioned, the information is still relevant and accurate.

The Idiot's Guide is actually quite good - I mean, really you can't dumb it down but so much and i've looked at that and the "Dummies" books and just like your college texts, they begin with "this is a note"... I mean it's all really pretty well-defined stuff so there's only so many ways to prevent it.

The difference is, practicing it, remembering it, and applying it!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;How is this book for getting into more advanced music theory?

Depends on if "advanced" means "advanced" or "theory I don't know yet"! K/P takes you though topics that would be advanced compared to what most people on this forum are aware even exists in the realm of theory.

&gt;I didn't quite understand what it's about(less generally). 

The title should have been a dead giveaway? It's about TONAL <b><u>HARMONY</u></b>!!! :-D

Seriously though, it is specifically about the kind of harmonic practices that existed during what we call the Common Practice Period which consists of the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods of music. Standard fare for university-level classroom theory instruction.

&gt;Should I read it before getting into counterpoint? 

Yes, if you're going to read anything before getting into counterpoint.

The real question is, if you should even be reading a theory text or not, and why you want to or think you should.

There are certainly aspects of "the fundamentals of music" that are useful to musicians who do not already know them, and these can easily be found in tons of online materials for free without ever picking up a theory text, let alone a high priced textbook. But those fundamentals are covered in the first couple of chapters. Most people have no need to learn how to realize figured bass, and many don't really need to learn to voice-lead. Since you're interested in counterpoint, those things would be helpful to learn first (which is the way most university courses are structured BTW) but honestly, realistically, learning those topics on your own are extremely difficult as you usually have no use for some of it, so no practical application, meaning no retention of what you learn, and no understanding of how it's useful and so on.

Really, if you're a pianist, and you enjoy Chopin and the like, you should take formal lessons with a qualified professional who can not only help you achieve your piano goals, but learn theory along the way. Then putting counterpoint into practice while playing contrapuntal pieces becomes much more relevant. So you can either take the rest of your life to try to learn something basic, or work within someone and learn it in a week. Choice is up to you.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Bob, do you have lyrics for this?

As a solo instrumental piece it reminds me of "lounge" piano - we used to have a guy at the mall that played a grand in Nordstrom's and it was all these sort of "muzak" - if you know what that is - type pieces.

That's not mean to be a derogatory term in this context but it is kind of a "light jazz/lounge" style which is fine.

However it sounds a little to me like it's an accompaniment for a melody and the melody got cut off!

There's melody on the upper notes of your chord stacks but the problem (for me) is that because it's a 4 note chord voiced like that it sounds like it's more about the chord and less about any melody note - and the fact that the melody note is the same not re-articulated 4 or 5 times makes it kind of stagnant. With someone singing that line - syllable per note - it would make sense.

But as a "subsumed into the top note of a chordal stack" it comes of as more of a re-articulated chord rather than any kind of melodic motive (IMHO).

The only real melodic bits serve more as "flourishes" at the end of a line so again that makes it seem more like this is an accompaniment for a solo instrument or voice where you're filling in the end of a phrase with your own flourishes while they take a breath.

The middle "solo" section again makes it sound that much more like a "song without melody" - the section beginning at m.56 seems like an instrumental break you'd take while the solo instrument lays out.

Even the way the sections are done - which is a little patchwork - seems like it would make more sense if there were lyrics lines for each section. Even the ending seems like it would be the thing that grows into the orchestral accompaniment for the "big ending" of some lavish Hollywood musical.

So it's all very nice, but just seems to lean more towards the "I'm an accompaniment for something more important" rather than it being "able to stand on its own right" if you understand what I mean - this commonly happens with Ballet - a great composer would generally make music to support the onstage action and choreography, without necessarily worrying if (or expecting) the music to stand on its own. We could argue the really great composers - Copland, Stravinsky, etc. made Ballet music that could stand on its own without the story or visual aspect - but a lot of it wasn't meant to stand on its own.

That's kind of what I get out of this - it's an accompaniment to a song, or a scene in a night club in a movie, where the piano part isn't the most important thing happening, and it's "background" music (which goes back to muzak in a bad way I suppose).

I like the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, rhythmic variety, textural and registral changes, etc. - you've got everything that makes a good piece - except maybe a "strong unifying factor" such as a "point of interest" like a strong melody.

At least that's what I took away from it - YMMV of course.

On a technical note, many of your syncopations are not notated correctly (rhythm) and you've got triplets on groups of FOUR notes that are beamed together which can be very confusing! The latter may be a limitation in musescore but if you can break that beam so it's 8th rest, 8th with a flag, then the triple, you have the correct notation.

mm. 6 and 7 should have the first 3 8ths continue to a 4th 8th note that is then tied so measure 6 would look like 8 8 8 8_8 8 Q and m.7  8 8 8 8_Q Q

This more clearly shows the beat and is standard engraving practice.

Some "shortcut" syncopation are commonly used, but these ain't them!

The doubly dotted note in m 23 would be an 8th tied into a dotted half. Those next two measures are funky as well. They should look more like the LH in m. 26 with a tie from the 3rd 8th going to a longer note.

So you've got a number of "beaming over the middle of the bar" or collecting smaller values into bigger one from a weaker beat into a stronger beat, which are generally no-nos.

Might help to look at some stuff like this:

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;The fact that I'm posting to this sub now means that I'm pretty desperate.

Wow. Thanks for making us feel good :-/

&gt;Writing melodies is just so difficult, seems to be nearly impossible sometimes.

I listened to the first 4 things you posted, as well as your track.

There is no "melody" in the Aphex Twin stuff. The AFX piece has a definite melody. It's pretty ordinary and nothing I would consider "catchy" or even marginally interesting. It's nice, and it fits the song, which is important, but beyond that, it's not anything "great" per se. I hear a melodic bass line in ROYGBIV, but other than that, there's not real melody.

Your piece has no real melody either (at least what I listened to which wasn't the entire track) - it's more like the Aphex Twin stuff - a drum beat and a chord progression with sound effects, which is very typical of this genre. In fact, a lot of "ambient" stuff is "anti melody" or "ambiguous melody" or at best, "floating melody" and it's more often supposed to be "relaxing" rather than "bouncy" or "memorable" and things like that - it's about creating *textures* not melodies per se. There are some "lines" here and there, but they're really just simply outlining the chord progression and not doing anything really "melodic".

That said, what's happening here is you are ascribing "awesomeness" to these things you like and that inspire you, but you're comparing yourself to it unfairly - either you're hyper critical of yourself (which is not a horrible thing, because it's what drives us to get better) or you just don't realize you're not that far off from these models.

Here is a very "catchy" melody from the early days of electronic music - it's kind of corny (and there's a pun there):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTUM8gFyLqo

Keep working, don't be too hard on yourself, and maybe push yourself to learn "more melodic melodies" - and STEAL from them. 

The "theory behind it" is to learn how to play and then analyze, and then try to recreate those things you like and that inspire you to create.

One thing about this style of music - this is in some ways "assembly line" music where people start with a beat, add a bass line, add a chord pad, and "build up" something that is just basically a looping chord progression. One of the things that happened with music with very strong melodies is either the melody is conceived first, or the melody is conceived in conjunction with the chord progressions, then suitable accompaniment is made for the melody - you might be trying to "melodize a <b><u>harmony</u></b>" when you should be trying to (or might find it a more effective way to work sometimes) "harmonize a melody".

HTH

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are several RN systems.

One of the most common ones uses Upper Case and Lower Case RN in a "major referential" manner and follows a pattern for 7th (and higher) chords based both on chord symbols and "case sensitive" RNs.

That is, Major 7ths are marked "M7" or Maj7, Major-minor 7ths (Dominant 7ths) are marked just 7, minor 7ths use a LC RN and 7, like so:

Imaj7

I7

i7

There are also two common "case insenstive" systems that assume Major or Minor based on a known key, so all RN are UC. There is a hybrid one found in Jazz where minor is added to those UC numerals that need them:

Cmaj7 = Imaj7 (or being jazz, may use the triangle symbol)

C7 = I7

Cm7 = Imin7 (rarely is a "minus" used anymore, and rarely is it just "m" but you will see Im7 sometimes).

In the first:

Imaj7 - ii7 - iii7 - IVmaj7 - V7 - vi7 - vii%7 (half diminished symbol)

In the latter:

Imaj7 - IImin7 -IIImin7 - IVmaj7 - V7 - VImin7 - VIIm7b5 (as jazz uses this symbol rather than half-diminished).

Note that the only real difference is that "min" must be added to those UC RN that require them, whereas in the previous system the minor is implied by the LC RN (iii7 for example).

____

There is an "academic" case-sensitive system used by Kostka/Payne in their text Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> where rather than being "major referential" as they two systems are, make an assumption based on the given Major or Minor key. This actually does not affect the diatonic chords:

I - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - vii^o

i - ii^o - III - iv - V - VI - vii^o 

The only difference between this and major referential one above is that while Eb in C Major would be called bIII, but *just* "III" in minor, in the major referential system it's called "bIII" period.

___

There's yet another "academic one" that uses only UC, so major looks like:

I II III IV V VI VII

and minor looks like

I II III IV V VI VII

!

In this system, it's assumed the person knows the key and this which are major, minor, or diminshed.

In this system, II7 in major would be minor7, IV7 would be Major7 and V7 would be dominiant 7th assuming it was a major key.

However, this is not a very effective means of communication especially online because too much context must be known ahead of time.

Most people online, and most published materials, especially in commercial music, gravitate towards the case sensitive, major referential RN system.

Most academics will use the case sensitive "mode referential" (Kostka/Payne style) RN and understand the commercial (pop) music system as well.

&gt;I've never seen any theorist indicate 7ths the way you've just described.

Really? There are thousands of resources that use this system. IME, the cast majority. In fact, I have the opposite experience - I've never seen the notation you mention.

It could be a country or language difference.

Google 12 Bar Blues Form and I don't even see a result in images with a "b7" appended to either the I or IV chord (when RN are being used)

Like so:

http://blagmusic.blogspot.com/2011/10/12-bar-blues-pattern.html

We do it just like the chords - A7 = I7, or IV7, or V7 or X7 wherever it is in the key. "7" just means dominant 7th (with an UC RN).




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Solfege is a system of using syllables instead of note names.

The real power in Solfege is *relationships* between notes that are reinforced by the Syllables.

For example "Fa to Mi" is a half step.

This mirrors both the descent of the 7th of the V7 chord and the natural tendency of scale degree 4 to fall to scale degree 3 in Major Keys - and both of those are common moves/resolutions on tonal music.

The beginnings of Solfege are traced back to Guido, and we name the "Guidonian Hand" after him. Guido use syllables Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La to "name" the notes of the so-called "Natural Hexachord". There were also Hard and Soft Hexachords. This sort of acted like "transposing" and leads into what we call "Moveable Do" Solfege.

Along the line, "Ut" was replaced with "Do" and eventually "Ti" was added, and some people went for a 2 letter consistency, thus "Sol" was changed to "So" in some systems.

_______

In some languages, the "Ut Re Mi..." thing caught on in a big way such that they actually named their musical tones with those syllables. So in French and Spanish, "La" is specifically the note A.

In German, and English, we instead used alphabet letters to name notes - so to English speakers, that same specific note is called "A".

Now, this causes a but of confusion with Solfege practice, which really was intended and in many people's opinions, is most effective when used in a "moveable" system.

So from that standpoint, the French are not "using Solfege" as a practical ear-training tool when simply "naming their notes" no more than we are by naming them C, D, E, etc.

Some people use a system of "solfege" called "Fixed Do" where the note C is always Do. So you sing G Major "So(l) La Ti Do Re" etc.

This, in many people's opinions, is doing little more than naming the notes, in the same way one might say "G A B C D".

Instead, "Moveable Do" uses a different concept, which is to always make Do the TONIC note. This is highly logical in a TONAL system, which is where most people apply Solfege (in terms of Audiation) practice.

This is more similar to saying "Scale Degree one, Scale degree two, etc." for any scale, or just "1 2 3 4 5" - which would be C D E F G in C Major, but D E F# G A in D Major.

Thus, the syllables being used this way is more similar to the way we use Roman Numerals to "un-note-ify" keys so we can see *relationships* between scale degrees (and chords, etc.).

This way "Do to Fa" is always a 4th, but specifically from scale degree 1 to scale degree 4 in *whatever* key you're in, as opposed to just "C to F".

_____________

Back to "Fa Mi" - that half step resolution, as possibly the 7th of a chord resolving to the 3rd of its chord of resolution, is a very important sound in tonal music.

So is, for example, "Ti Do" which is the leading tone to the tonic (in moveable Do).

So much so that other resolutions a half step up take on the same sound - or "rhyme" if you will.

So when we alter a note chromatically, such as F# in the key of C, the F#'s usual resolution is to G, acting as if it is the leading tone to G. So we use the "Ti" sound on the F - which was "Fa", but we "rhyme it" so it becomes "Fi". So "Fi So" is a half step resolution that looks and sounds like a Leading Tone to Tonic resolution, so part of it "rhymes" with "Ti Do".

Do, when raised a half step, usually resolves to Re, so it's "Di to Re" - Di again rhyming with Ti, because it functions similarly.

The resolution of "Le to So" in Minor is also a powerful one, and when, for example, the Leading Tone "Ti" is lowered a half step, it no longer wants to resolve up to Do (as an "ee" sound) and we change the syllable to "Te" (tay) so it sounds like Le (lay) and that "sound" if you will, resolves down to La.

This is mostly consistent within the system with a few exceptions.

But this helps to cover the two most important resolutions in tonal music - that of Ti to Do, and that of a 7th of a chord down a half step (as in Te La).

Thus, by "orienting" Do to the Tonic of any key, all these relationships are borne out not only for the Diatonic notes, but for chromatic notes (both essential and unessential). Likewise, "moveable Do" allows us to MODULATE as well, moving Do to any new Tonic as most tonal music usually modulates and is part of the system.

______

How is this applicable to audiation? By learning the *sound* of a syllable resolution, it more readily allows one to hear that resolution "in their head". By singing it, it helps to internalize it even more.

"Fa Mi" or "Ti Do" start to take on very specific sounds in your head once you do them enough (again, beyond the note-specific form in some languages).

So your question, can't they just audiate the notes instead? Yes, they can, but "F E" has a different sound than "Bb A" in terms of "saying" (singing, thinking the words) than "Fa Mi" - and in moveable Do, Fa Mi is always going to be F-E in C, or Bb-A in F, and since that's 4-3 in those two keys, it's the same resolution. We could also say "four three" but we can't really say "flat seven six" and get the same sound out of it. But using "Te" as the "Le" sound that mirrors the "flat six to five" resolution, we have things that "rhyme" and this mentally reinforce the move with similar-sounding syllables that produce similarly-resolving moves (note: Fa Mi isn't "Fe Mi" because it evolved earlier in diatonic form, but it works for most of the remaining sounds).

_______

One the biggest mistakes most people make when they go to learn Solfege is to not understand this TONAL connection - or at least, not understand that it *can be* more than just "naming notes and intervals".

You'll see hundreds of posts here about "give me a song for X interval" and that's not how it *should* work.

Instead of thinking "of, Fa down to Ti is the beginning of So and So's song" one should be thinking "that's scale degree 4, down to scale degree 7, which is the 7th and 3rd of the V7 chord, which is a tritone, which resolves to the root and 3rd of the Tonic <b><u>harmony</u></b>, so I should hear Fa as a half step above Mi of the tonic triad, and Ti as the leading tone of the key, resolving to the Tonic note."

Seems like a lot more to think about, but really it's not because in Tonal music, all that is tied together when you "hear" it and identify it.

So Solfege in terms of a practical means of audiation is a "thing" becuase by using syllables, we can create rhymes that give us more information than simply "naming the notes" and helps us to better hear the resolutions and relationships present in abundance in tonal music. It leads to a deeper understanding of interval relationships, and scale degree relationships, and when sung and drilled, both by singing and through ear-training, it helps to reinforce the theoretical concepts taught in "theory" with practical sonic/aural practices that **internalize** the sounds far better than just playing them on an instrument.

So it's a very important thing when use well, and learned correctly.

Doing those things is tricky though with all the misinformation out there.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is a common misconception about Mozart.

First of all, Mozart *was* working in the "Classical" era, and the reason we chose that word to describe the music, art, and literature of this period was because it did in fact look back to the art and architecture of "the classics" as in the Greek and Roman arts.

That "squareness" shouldn't be seen as a flaw, but rather just a part of the style, in the same way that in Blues, you sing blue notes. IOW, it's not really Mozart's fault, just like it wasn't Abba's fault they dressed in 70s spacesuit gear - it was "the times" and what everyone did.

Furthermore, that "squareness" represents a form of mathematical purity some people dig, and additionally it produces self-symmetry in a why that people studying fractal geometry and whatnot can relate to in a way that say, Gregorian Chant does not (and we can't fault them for not using <b><u>harmony</u></b>, because it just didn't exist at that time).

Additionally, Mozart actually was far more creative in "breaking out of the box" than his contemporaries and rivals Haydn and Beethoven (and exceeds them really) in terms of "not being foursquare". Haydn - who taught and inspired Mozart - was especially fond of phrases with 3 parts, 3 part periods, and so on. Mozart inherited some of this. Mozart, like Haydn, also constantly does things like extend his phrases so they are not "foursquare" and are things like 4+4+4+6 as a period.'

Don't just dismiss Mozart because you heard someone else say this (it's a common misconception) or because you've heard a couple of pieces that do do this (and all composers usually have some simplistic things in their opus) and absolutely consider that he was working at a time when "symmetry" was a desirable characteristic and he is the *epitome* of this in a good way - yet still is not only highly creative within those confines, but even breaks out of them regularly.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It doesn't have to be anything.

But, if you're trying to use it in a way that other composers have, you need to use it the way other composers did.

And the best way to understand that is to learn their music - and pay attention to how those things are used in that music.

See here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrowed_chord

Mode Mixture isn't about just sticking in some note from some other mode. It sometimes can be and on a very simple level is, but the way it was used in classical music is far more involved than that - "mode" there means "Key Type" as in major or minor tonality, and more often entire harmonies are borrowed rather than a single note, and it can be more than just a single chord. It's really about "shifting into the opposite mode" temporarily.

And this is generally done by borrowing a <b><u>harmony</u></b> from the parallel key (usually chords from the minor mode being borrowed and used in the major mode) and using it in the same functional setting.

So for example, a progression like I - ii^6 - V7 - I could have the ii chord replaced by a diminished chord - I - ii^o6 - V7 - I - in that particular case, since the ii^o has already set up the minor mode, then that could easily go to a minor i6/4 chord right before the V7.

Most of the functional borrowing happens on Sub-Dominant chords, such a ii^o, iv, and bVI and as vii^o7 in place of viiø7 and V7b9 - notice all of those actually involve the use of scale degree b6!


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Is this an Fsus4 chord in C major or is it something else?

No, as you surmise, an Fsus4 would be F-Bb-C

The chord in the image would best be called Fsus#4 - that's going to give the most information with the least amount of confusion and elements in the symbol.

More traditionally, Fadd#11 would get you a similar sound, but it doesn't imply that the 3rd should be left out (the 3rd is left on out plain 11 chords but the point of sharping the 11th is to not conflict with the 3rd so someone might assume it's OK to include it or even intended to be included by the arranger).

Anything else someone might suggest (and you will get them) is context-dependent or just attempts to make sense of it with something that doesn't make sense, like Cmaj7sus4/F - kind of convoluted to tell what it is unless the context is really clear that it's a C <b><u>harmony</u></b> and not an F one as the out of context image and you're thinking of F as the root implies.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think the timbre does help - it's kind of metallic and bell-like or gong-like, which has a bit of inherent out-of-tune-ness in the sound, and it makes many of us immediately associate it with Gamelan or other Asiatic sounds we've been conditioned to hear.

Repetition always helps - there's the old joke when you're improvising - if you hit a wrong note, hit it again, and then everyone will think you meant to do it.

The the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is more drone-like also helps out the situation.

There are a lot of "myths" in music - some are due to ignorance (lack of learning) but others can just be broad general statements not truly meant to be taken as gospel (though an unfortunate problem is many ignorant people do pick it up as gospel) but gets spread around and presented as such.

Plus many are so uninformed about modes they don't really know how they work.

Of course Locrian exists, and of course people have made music with it.

That we now live in an era where such sounds are now more commonplace helps it sound that much less "offensive to the sensibilities" than it used to.

But it is still primarily the realm of "experimental" music.

I wish (well, almost wish) some Rapper would use it in a hit song and then everyone would be clamoring all over the internet all excited about it!

But I think it's still fair to say - in a broadly general context - that Locrian is "not used" or "rarely used" (extremely rarely comparatively speaking) and the understanding should be that it exists, but can't be approached in quite the same way other modes are.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You know, I don't know of any specific term.

In a modulation, we call such a chord a "Pivot Chord" but there are many other similar terms in various languages and cultures so there's no one "official" correct word.

I'm sure there are terms for "duality" from the more general "ambiguous" to the more specific terms like "Apparent" chord and I'm sure more in Schenkerian theory that hopefully other posters could enlighten you on.

"Polymorph"? :-)

I think the problem here is, you can get progressions that sort of "overlap" at one or more chords, kind of dovetailing and morphing functions as they go.

I know you argued against the other poster who responded "not all music is functional" but TBH that was my first reaction as well.

Popular music can have and often does have strong ties to both Tonal music and Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. However, much of it doesn't and in many cases it kind of stretches the boundaries.

So my point would be, you ultimately get to a point where discussions like this really become irrelevant - Function is pointless, as it's essentially non-functional.

Now, I brought up the Phrygian point as a "sonic function" if you like - IOW, it seems like whenever a person encounters a progression that's unusual, they fell this need to "justify it". And they usually do so by trying to analyze it functionally. This need is so great they they seem to have trouble just accepting "it's not functional". You see stuff like that all the time - it "sounds good" so it MUST BE functional!

But really, the only justification necessary is that it's there in the song already!

We'd really have to ask Daryl Hall.

So I think that b6-5-1 is a power sound an in isolation, as it comes by, "makes sense" because it is such a familiar sound. And that alone - if we must say it - "justifies" the B Major chord. And then the SOUND of that chord simply sets up the Sound of the ultimate "Picardy Third" if we like (that's a great example, because, does calling it a Picardy Third somehow justify its use? After all, it's something we've heard before tons of times, so it's not that it's *called* a Picardy, but that its a familiar *sound*).

Personally, I like learning to play songs like this and noting unusual moves, and then use them myself. I don't really care as much about "analyzing" them beyond the surface elements, because I know if I'm going to use it based on sound, DH&amp;JO did as well, and they got it from something they learned, and those people got it from something they learned and so on.

So it's great we name some of these moves, to help "catalog" them, but I don't really see them as the primary point of interest in the music if you see what I'm saying - which is easier said as "not all music is functional" - which means, trying to fit a functional analysis on something that was "eared out" may not be anywhere near as informative as listening to the song it was ripped off from :-)

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Chord-Melody is very popular amongst guitarists and I'm not totally sure if it's exclusive to guitar - piano has many more options for playing independent lines that I would think a lot of pianists would only do chord-melody style in an attempt to mimic what guitarists sort of are more stuck doing.

Basically, a melody is taken, and each note of the melody - though some may be passing tones etc. - is given a chord.

Here's a typical example:

https://youtu.be/gqD_4b3ZsZ0?t=45s

Your pianist here is just playing basic melody with RH and chords with the LH. What's unusual about it is each melody note has a re-iteration of the chord.

In chord-melody "proper" let's say, there's a *different* <b><u>harmony</u></b> on each melody note for the most part.

So this is more of just a "re-iteration" of the chord rather than just holding it or playing it rhythmically.

This is how I'd probably play jazz piano becuase my brain lacks the ability to do things independently in each hand like that - so I probably would do the same rhythm in my LH that my right hand played!

It actually reminds me a lot of "arranger" style keyboards, organs and synths where you could play a LH single note that would be a C Major chord, and as you played melody notes the same C Major chord re-iterates with the melody note on top for each melody note you play!

TMK there's no name for this, and it is what it is and nothing more, and is really that simple - the chord in the accompaniment is re-iterated (re-played, re-struck, re-attacked) in the same rhythm as the melody notes. Actually pretty rare and unusual, and considered a drawback of early electronic instruments that did it this way - was seen as "cheesy" on them.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's a good book. Keep it. There are great ideas and it's always nice to have for inspiration.

Theory is a funny thing because it's not so much linear as it is more like a tree with branches and plenty of leaves.

The "roots" of the tree are the fundamentals, like pitch, rhythm, meter, intervals, and chord, and the the main trunk is like analysis of music using those tools - primarily common practice music.

Then that branches off into all these subcategories and different things.

So "advanced" concepts can mean many different things - for example, you have to really understand those basics before you can make sense of things like bassizans and tenorizans in early music cadences, but you also have to understand it for things like Enharmonic Modulations - but Enharmonic Modulations and Early Music Cadences are really completely different - both advanced, but both very different.

Switching Tonalities, or "Modulation" and Mode Mixture/Interchange are aspects of Common Practice Period <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and not 20th century <b><u>harmony</u></b>. We might consider them somewhat advanced topics within the main tree trunk of theory - the first big limbs.

But honestly, I think you ought to ditch the theory books and learn actual music by actual people. Learn songs that have modulation in them, and see how they did it - then you'll know how to do it like that! Theory helps you put terms to what's going on, but it's really important you HEAR and APPLY these things and there's no better way to do that than playing music that contains it.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>When I read your title my gut instinct was to say "yes".

Because most people do :-)

So, all of the modes are "rotationally related" and for example, people will say that D Dorian is "from" the Parent Scale of C Ionian (or C Major).

This is actually exactly how we usually think of a Major and its relative minor, such as C Major an Am - Am is a "rotation" of C Major - it's "C Major starting on its 6th note".

However, musically speaking, it's not really the best way to think of it.

Music in A Minor is really in the key of A, not the key of C, and it has really no relationship to it other than the keys being relative.

So it's better to think of Modes as *intervallic relationships* between each note and the "tonic" note.

So, for example, Major and Minor aren't really "rotations of each other" (although they are). Instead, Major is a scale (or key) where the 2nd is a M2, and the 3rd is a M3 and so on while Minor is a scale (or key) where the 3rd is a **minor** 3rd, etc.

If we were to compare C Major with the PARALLEL mode of C Minor, we can see the difference:

C D E F G A B  versus

C D Eb F G Ab Bb

we can see that certain notes are altered, and that of course changes the intervallic replationships between all notes, and all notes and the tonic, etc.

Thus we usually describe Major like W W H W W W H and minor like W H W W H W W - in half and whole steps - not as "related to" - I mean we can see it's a "rotation" sure, but it's not really the way we conceptualize them in music.

So, what is C Mixolydian?

Well, rotationally speaking, it means its parent scale is F. But musically speaking, we don't want to talk about C when we're playing in Am, and we certainly don't think of Am when we're playing in C (at least, we probably shouldn't be if we are...).

So it really doesn't make sense to think of **C** Mixolydian as anything else but some type of **C** scale - a C scale with a particular intervallic relationship between notes.

It just so happens that all 7 modes have a *unique* interval relationship so no two are the same.

Mixolydian is W W H W W H W

But, for comprehension purposes, like would could say "Minor is just major with its 3rd, 6th, and 7th scale degrees lowered a half step" we could compare Mixolydian to Major as well.

So if we take Major and compare it to Mixolydian, we find that:

Mixolydian = Major with scale degree 7 lowered 1 half step.

Now, Locrian has a LOT of notes lowered one half step, and since Minor already has 3 as compared to Major, what we typically do is group the Modes according to "Major" or "Minor" families - which they're closest to (M3 or m3 in the scale):

Major Modes:

Lydian = Major with a raised 4th scale degree.

Major = Major (or Ionian if you like)

Mixolydian = Major with a lowered 7th.

Minor Modes:

Dorian = Minor with a raised 6th.

Minor = Minor (Aeolian)

Phrygian = Minor with a b2

Locrian = Minor with a b2 AND b5.

So it's far better (and maybe more musical, or at least musically useful) to consider the modes in this manner because that's how they tend to get used in pieces.

The piece "in Locrian" simply used notes of a scale that had an intervallic relationship of the Locrian mode - if it were B Locrian, it would be like B minor with a lowered 2 and 5. Is it also "C Major" - well yeah, sure, but what makes it "in Locrian" is that the EMPHASIS melodically and harmonically is NOT on a C note, but on the B note instead - that "centers" the music on B, and with that intervallic relationship in relation to B, we have B Locrian - a minor mode with b2 and 5.

To expand on this, it's also Am, D dorian, E Phrygian...why don't we call it those too? Because we've been conditioned to be too Major Centric - and thinking Major when you should be thinking Locrian is just misleading. Locrian should really be its own thing, just like Am is distinct from C Major - otherwise why would have needed all these different modes right?

________

The 2nd part of your question is also a misconception.

This is a Jazz thing (and maybe primarily a guitar thing) that unfortunately confuses a lot of people because it conflated "modality" with the use of "Modes as a pitch restrictor" for use in improvisation - which are different tools if you like.

If you are in a piece in the KEY of C Major, you play notes from C Major. The chords will come from C Major, and the melody notes should come from C Major. You don't change to G Mix over a G chord and F Lydian over an F chord any more than you should change to Am over an Am chord.

It's all in C. Period. Walk away.

What do I play over this progression:

C - Am - F - G - I play notes from C Major. I might emphasize some notes of each chord more prominently than the other scale notes, but I'm just as likely to play melodic motives that fit (I'm also likely to do some pentatonic wankery but that's a different issue).

Now, having said that, if you had a vamp that went:

Cmaj7 - Dm7 - back and forth, if you wanted to "think" D Dorian for the Dm7 chord, one reason to do so is it does "orient" you to the chord tones and help you focus on them - if that's what you want. But otherwise you should just be playing "notes from C Major" because that's what key your'e in.

Now if the chords were:

Dm7 - G7 back and forth, and that's it, THEN it's time to play D Dorian because this is a D Dorian Vamp. Again, it doesn't really make sense to change to G Mixolydian on the G chord (though again, with the exception you might think of it that way to orient you to the chord tones - but you can do that without invoking the mode).

You could say, "hey, wait, all those notes come from C Major, so why can't I just play C Major". Well, you could, but imagine if you play "notes from C Major" over an Am chord progression - it's just going to sound like Am - because the <b><u>harmony</u></b> wins out in these situations.

And, it's probably just going to sound like you don't know what you're doing because you're emphasizing the wrong notes :-)

Where this "chord-scale" thinking becomes more important is when you want to start implying altered extensions or when you have chords that don't all come from the same Key/Mode.

If your progression is C9 - D9 - F9 - Bb9 it may sound cool, but you're not going to be able to stay in any key any longer than one chord. So you might for example want to play C Mix, then D Mix, then F Mix, then Bb Mix, because that's likely the scale that's going to fit each chord in succession. You might be able to do something like C Lydian Dominant over the C9 because the F# is coming up in the next chord and the Bb might not sound so horrible over the D9 (especially since it works in the F9 and Bb9 chords as well) so there might be other modes that provide other notes - and that's why I said they're "pitch restrictors" - because they're just being used to get you a set of 7 (often) notes that's going to go with one or as many chords as you can get them to.

_____

Most "Modal" music is not the "jazz" way, and even much in jazz is not "chord-scale" approach - though many may in fact conceptualize it that way (especially guitarists). But for most music in general, it's better to reserve that kind of thinking specifically for that particular style, and where it's just one practical approach of many that will get you specific sounds over various harmonies. I mean, a player might very well play straight Mix over a chord one time through, then use Phrygian Dominant the next time through to imply a b9 extension - if the accompaniment players are not playing the 9th, you can get away with that kind of stuff (and it's jazz so you can probably get away with it anyway ;-).

So really, it's probably better to conceptualize modes by and large in a "Parallel" relationship - C Phrygian is "like C Minor with a b2" - rather than worrying about what it's Parent Major Scale is - most people have trouble figuring that out anyway and it just confuses them further!

Save the "relative" way for just simply understanding that yes, all 7 are related in a similar way to Major and Minor, and all can be rotationally derived from each other. That is something you could exploit and use, and sometimes is, but is often not the most useful way to approach modes in a piece of music, especially anything that isn't directly using chord-scale approach - and even then the "relative" versions aren't really necessary when it's all in one primary key or mode - it's more useful for out-of-key things, which takes you  into other modes/scales anyway.


HTH 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It really is a tough thing to get over and probably on some level just requires some personal soul searching.

ONe of the best arguments I can come up with is that people on forums like this constantly post worried about their chord progression sounding like someone else's, or, they are trying to find something truly unique.

And I'm always like (crotchety old man that I am) well you're writing in 4/4 though.

See, the problem is, there is the emphasis on things that DON'T matter, and a neglect of things that do.

I made a point in another post that Chord Progression can't be copyrighted. That's because - wait for it - they're not that important.

All these people here going "what scale is this" "what scale do I play over this" - they're totally missing what makes music music.

You're going to build a House? Well, you start with a plan, a foundation, standard materials and construction techniques. That's what music is. What makes one house unique from another (barring underground homes and miniature ones you pull behind a trailer and all that) is the DECORATION - and that's where people need to be spending their energy.

Do you think Mozart said, "Oh shit, I can't write in C Major **again** because I've already done it".

It's kind of like the OCD person that can't step in their own footprints from yesterday but still has to go back and forth to school everyday. It's a tremendous waste of mental energy.

Better to take the Einstein example of having the same suit hanging in his closet so he didn't have to waste time picking out what to wear each day.

"I'm going to write a blues" - done - there are now 10 or 12 things that you can already have "pre composed" for you, and you can get on to the business of coming up with the song part, not the structure part.

I know your example is a lick, but it's the same kind of philosophy.

No one faults Mozart for not coming up with Tone Poems or other new forms - it was like he said, "today I'm going to write a symphony" and that already had a lot of things already pre-written for you. 

So I just think the more you think about this kind of stuff, and maybe pay attention to it in other areas of life too, it can help you get over that hurdle - it's still not easy, but at least it can help get you out of that vicious cycle.

FWIW, maybe force yourself just to write something that does have a lot of "givens" so you can concentrate on maybe melody, rather than <b><u>harmony</u></b> or orchestration, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;What would you put on top of a basic chord progression so it's something harmonically interesting to hear?" 

You have a <b><u>harmony</u></b>. That's the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I forgot earlier, and was actually thinking about this earlier.

Here's a "boring" I - vi - IV - V with a few changes. And it does some oh-so predictable things like move to IV for the pre-chorus and bVI for the Bridge.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>AHHHHHHHH FOUR NOTE CHORDS EVERYWHERE RUN FOR YOUR LIFE :-D

Seriously, those "big" chords make it very "dense" - which is fine for a climax or textural change, but it's like they're going all the time. Rather than a bit plain as the other poster said, I'd go so far as to say it can sound like being hit over the head with a hammer constantly. It gets to the point where we're like, "OK, I get it, you can write big chords" (enough already!).

At the top, you've got rolls on so many of the chords also - while you might have been going for schmaltzy, it's a little schmaltzy!

So just some ideas - m.8 - it's sort of "winding down" there, why not have it just go down to 1-3 notes like a C in the RH and F and E in the left or something. The pickup notes could then bring you back into the bigger chords if you must.

I feel like the whole point of your intro in 4 and the change to 3/4 is a bit contrived - I mean, I think it's a good idea but by playing the whole measure chords in 3, it's not really the effective transition I think you were going for.

You soulc so easily take the LH part in m.4 and just make the A note a quarter note and turn that into a 3/4 pattern. Likewise, the 3 8th note pickups could easily become 2 sets of 3 notes for 6 8th notes in 3/4 - there are some ways you could "morph" from 4/4 to 3/4 using material you already have here - something like you did around m. 93 - which is a really beautiful section BTW and a wonderful contrast.

I think you've got some nice material here, I just feel like texturally it's too thick all the time and could use more of that contrast - you've got nice use of registers (which a lot of people miss) and nice harmonic and melodic motion, and interesting sections and motives, but it does get a little "texturally stagnant".

I think maybe if you could get into the 3/4 section not unlike you get out of the 3/4 section, and give us some relief from the density, that would improve the piece greatly. You may be able to just drop some doubled notes out of the chords. You might find one section about midway that lightens up the texture a lot might do the trick, or you might want to try lightening each section in different ways so not only do you have interesting melodic and <b><u>harmony</u></b> changes, but textural ones as well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'll admit that when I read your title my gut response was, "oh, you have have you..."

While we might be able to assume you weren't *really* implying that you know everything there is to know, there are enough people out there who are so totally naive as to believe they do know everything there is to know - so it's not really easy to tell from the context of you original post.

Let's just say, it was a bad way to word your post.

Once one "masters" Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, usually one either moves forward in time to post-Tonal theory, or back in time to Modal theory. 

It's kind of a shame that most people want to go into post-Tonal theory without studying pre-Tonal theory but obviously if you're following the progression of time it is a little easier to follow the threads of "extended tonality" since you're building on what you already know.

There are, if you like, two major streams of post-Tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b>. One involves what we might call a more natural evolution, with an "expansion" of the concepts of tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> to include more remote keys, more chromaticism, more non-diatonic harmonies, additional pitch resources, new forms and re-thinking of old forms, and so on. The other stream is more of a "man-made" change in direction (though it evolved naturally, it's slightly more "forced" maybe) into "anti-Tonality" and a break with tradition - so we have a continuation and expansion of tradition, and a complete break with tradition going on simultaneously - a fork in the road.

The break with tradition involves a new set of tools to analyze music with because you can't really build off what came before in the same way you can with the more traditional "expanded" vocabulary.

You can study both of course, but one may be more appealing to you than the other (or going back in time to early music might appeal to you as well).

Unfortunately, there is no "common practice" among users of extended tonality and its harder to categorize and write about aside from general principles and concepts.

On the other hand, something like Set Class theory is more broadly applicable and becomes very "common practice" in Serial Atonality, thus making it at least a little more concrete to study.

So that might be the more well-defined and more interesting (and maybe useful) path to follow at least initially.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You're asking about double stops.

There are a number of ways to do this but some double stops are more "comfortable" (and also depends on how much time you have to get to and from them). 

There's a violin forum here so you'd actually be better off to ask there.

But, FWIW, C-G is a perfect 5th which would be the same position on two adjacent strings, which is not a favorite of fiddlers! They tend to like (or at least, learn earlier) intervals of 3rds and 6ths.

So of your two, C-E on the 2nd, and G-C on the 1st would be a more likely layout.

But always best to consult with an actual violinist on questions like these because context is important as well.

There's really the question here of whether you really need to be writing this like this in the first place. You're even asking it kind of like it's hypothetical and the answer there is, it might certainly be POSSIBLE, but it doesn't mean it's either practical or even necessary (or idiomatic, etc.). So, in all likelihood, there might be a number of other ways to get a C <b><u>harmony</u></b> without using double stops.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The most common way to make a lead guitar <b><u>harmony</u></b> is to play a note above or below another note, a specific distance away, and staying in the key.

So if you have a line like:

C-E-F-G

what you would do is add notes a 3rd above, but staying in the same key (I'm using C Major for this example):

E - G - A - B

C - E - F - G

you'll notice that the "<b><u>harmony</u></b> line" beginning on E is always 3 notes higher than the "lead line" beginning on C.

Now, this may or may not sound good, but it's a typical starting point.

The most common way to "harmonize a lead line" is to add a 3rd above it, or a 6th above it. You ca also try a 3rd below it, or a 6th below it.

The other most common ones (but are pretty rare in comparison) are to harmonize it at a 5th or 4th above or below.

Sometimes someone will say these are lines "harmonized in 3rds" etc., or they are "parallel 6ths" and so on.

Sometimes, <b><u>harmony</u></b> notes on a line will change momentarily so they either sound better or match a chord. So if the chord is a C chord, which has the notes C, E, and G, you can see if you put an E above C, they're both in the chord. If you put a G above E, they're both in the chord.

But, if your melody note is G, then a B above the note might not sound so good with a C chord underneath. So you could adjust the interval from a 3rd to a 4th on that one note (so you end up with G and C) so you get notes that are still part of the chord.

So one of the easiest things you can do is come up with a little melody idea, and then add a note a 3rd above it, and see what kind of sound you get. This is a super common way to do Guitar harmonies and Vocal harmonies in pop songs.

Start messing around with 3rds above or below, and 6ths above or below, and see what you get. Just remember to keep the notes that are added to the original line in the same key as the original and you'll get some pretty good results almost immediately.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>April Rag - this is just a thing of mine - I don't like repeated notes in that fashion that start the melody - a lot of times if you were to hear a Violinist or other instrumentalist play a melody like that you don't really get the repeated note and instead just a long one. And I find on piano or other instruments that can articulate it sounds a bit "forced" or "mechanical" and so on. So I would take those first 2 C notes in the melody and just combine them into a quarter note so the rhythm is like the 2nd measure (and really all the subsequent measures - which in fact makes it seem all the more like an unintentional note since the remaining measures don't have that rhythm).

The section with the Ab - well, it's time for a new section at this point but it really kind of messes up the flow. It's really very "wrong" sounding rhythmically - part of it is that the offbeat chord accents probably need to come on the 3rd note of a triplet rather than in "square" rhythm. But the way you lead into it is really kind of "jumpy" or "clunky"

The next section at 33 - I'd really consider changing the C notes in the melody (maybe D# to lead into the next E like a blue note) because the LH chord has that same C in it and it causes a weird doubled note again where it's not clear whether it's part of the accompaniment or note - either that or get rid of the upper C note on the LH part.

m. 36 suffers from the same problem as before I think - the switch to "square" rhythm is too abrupt. Happens 4 measures later.

However, on the next page when you start intermixing triplets and even 8ths - THAT's the way to get those even 8ths in there - so maybe if you want these measures with even 8ths in there they should be prefaced by a measure more like 45 or how the two measures before that work.

Tjag Rag is AWESOME!!!

Two things - the long A in the melody you've got tied over like 3 or 4 bars. Just give it like one or two. (like how you did on the first ending)

And don't end on a 2nd inversion chord!

Also, you might go through and check accidentals - after your chords with the F natural in the bass for example, it goes to an F# in the bass - you should really have a cautionary accidental there.

But a little notational tidying up and this one is top notch!

____

This may be a playback issue (which could be true of April Rag also) but rhythmically this one comes off as very strange - I think I see what you're trying to get at but it's coming off as a mess - it's almost like you're trying too hard to be cute with syncopations. The whole m.11 kind of rhythm doesn't really come off as I think you intend. In fact, it almost sounds like what you really want there is a quarter note triplet.

I like the rhythm in the first measure. The rhythm in the melody in the first ending is really great.

But 45-46 - even though you did this rhythm before, it seems like the last 8th of 45 should be tied over the bar, like the first measure of the piece. Like it is in 49-50.

65 - you know, as cliche as it is, you probably need "bump bump bump" in the bass under the held chord instead of the held chord - that cessation of motion is really kind of odd there. Sounds like the end in fact.

The melody in 67 - that doesn't get tied over the bar - THAT idea works really well with the new note on the downbeat of the next measure - which I don't think works as well with that earlier passage - maybe because of the shape of the melody.

That whole last section also gets into some odd harmonic choices - I like what I think you're trying to do (and the chromatic descent part is great) but there are some odd inner voice choices, conflicts with the upper notes, and some things like happened in April Rag where you get a confusion between accomp and melody notes (usually same pitch in different octaves but rhythmically displaced).

So this one's kind of weird - it's like half of it is the best of the three, but at the same time, half of it is the worst of the three - if that makes sense. It's got some cool rhythms, but it seems a little forced in places, and sometimes the melody notes are not the best choice to really show off the rhythm. Likewise, there's some great harmonies, but they don't seem to be fully thought out.

IMHO, for a piece like this, I think the best thing to do is go over it with a fine tooth comb and say "is this REALLY what I want here".

________

The waltz is nice. I think, a pattern is emerging here. You like these syncopations, but it's kind of like you're still trying to feel your way if they work or not. I think there's a limit to "toying with our expectations". For example the end of the phrase where you hold the F# over then hit the Gm chord late - well, maybe that's not the greatest place to do that. I know it's "unexpected" but it's also a little to "beyond the pale" to be effective that way. It just sounds "forced" again.

I LOVE the beginning - you know, it's just long enough - it's like "is something going to happen, what's going on" - so here's an example of you toying with our expectations in what i think is an effective and fun way.

The first phrase - THAT's how you use repeated pitches :-D Bravo.

Fun unexpected <b><u>harmony</u></b> change - keeping in line with the opening - brilliant. Switch to Gm - nice (could use the cautionary accidental again there though especially as that's the kind of context people would assume the G Major would continue).

mm. 23-24 - again, I'm not crazy about your choice of rhythm here. Again, I see what you're trying to do, but I don't think it's effective.  For example, something like keep m. 23 like you have, but add an additional low note on beat 2, then in m. 24 have a melody note on the down beat and not tied over, and NO note in the bass on beat 1, but one on beat 2 - THAT would be the kind of quirky surprise you already set up. It might also work if you keep the tie over the bar, play the bass on beat 1 and 2, or bass on beat 1 then the last melody note on beat 2.

Otherwise, it seems to "stall out" there.

Next section - m. 28 - great use of syncopation there. Very effective.

I like the octaves. The repeat of the opening maybe could use the octaves from m. 49 on to vary it a little. Or that could happen at m.59 - what's happening here is you need some different texture/registral changes, or a change in the way the accompaniment is going.

m. 73 is another "stall" - the octave section after that is a nice change though.

You know, you've often got a "Coda" section and I'm not sure if it's necessary. This piece might need a little pruning - like maybe that middle section that's basically the top again could just go away and it could be more of a through-composed A-B-C-coda type arrangement or something.

By 89 I was ready for the piece to be over. Fortunately, like the others I assumed this would be a coda section but you know if this was the only piece I'd heard I wouldn't know that. So it started to get a little long.

There are a few spots where I think you could fix up your harmonies - 2nd inversion chord starts a section sounds a little "empty". The descending chromatic section is effective but there's a chord in there that's like "that's not what I think he meant" kind of chord. Couple of notation things to - there's a Db that should be a C# to lead up to the following D natural or something like that.

But you don't have dynamics and phrasing, and only sparse pedalling - so I know these are "works in progress" but I think you've got some real diamonds in the rough here.

One thing I'd like to see you move towards is "connecting" phrases - for example, often, at the end of a phrase, you'll just have your accompaniment either keep doing what it was doing, end with the melody, or just do something like a down beat note and a downbeat note.

What you need more of is "lead ins" to the next phrase - 74 is a great example where you have pickup notes for the melody - but notice everything before that just stalls. 78 gives a little hint - where you have a repeated bass note on beat 3 (which would more typically be a D).

For example, what if there was a line ib mm. 15-16 that echoed what the melody just did in 14-15?

m. 24 is the perfect place - I suggest something on beat 2, but it (or places like it) might also benefit from 8th notes on beats 2 and 3 that "lead into" the next section.

Because your sections seem a little "four square" and simply end on the down beat of measure 7, and maybe have a note or two go over into m. 8, but often - except for the few syncopations that don't really work so well, tend to have "nothing happening" in the last measure of the section (or last two even!).

You seem to have the basic phrasing down, and how to put melodies and harmonies together, so "connecting" the sections - "dovetailing" them together so they "transition" from one into the other rather than just sound like "here's a section, now here's another section" would sort of be the next compositional thing to challenge yourself with.

As always, I'm just some dude on the internet. You don't know me, you don't know how valid my comments are. But if you said to yourself "you know, I was thinking the same thing about that spot" or "I though that spot was funky too", then it may be worth re-investigating them. Likewise, if my comments also agree with other posters, then those spots may be worth looking at again as well.

Great work - especially the Tjag Rag. Thanks for sharing them and being willing to take criticism (which is always intended constructively).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Which people are obsessed with it? Have you done a complete historical survey of all music, or any style of music, that shows there is a marked preference for descending bass lines? So much so you'd call it an obsession?

I would argue that it would be a fairly safe guess that descending bass lines are in fact probably somewhat more common than ascending bass lines, and maybe enough so that we could say the down is preferred to up, but on the flip side, there's enough "non-directional" bass lines to show a marked preference for those on the whole.

So why are they obsessed with them? What implications to they have?

Now, all that said, there are some common enough patterns such as diatonically and chromatically descending bass lines.

On one hand, it takes you away from the Tonic and towards the Dominant - and a shorter route than the other direction.

It also involves a slightly more "acceptable" system of pitches when going chromatically, in that all of the notes available in minor keys are present.

A common pattern is:

Cm - Bb - Ab - G, or in classical music, Cm - Gm/Bb - Fm/Ab - G

The implication of the latter is that a couple of non-functional chords in a retrogression includes a minor dominant which may be of interest.

In a chromatic progression, it does offer inversions like:

C - G/B - Gm/Bb - F/A, or in a more pop setting, Cm - G/B - Bb - F/A - Ab - Eb/G - which easily makes for sequential patterns in the melody (the <b><u>harmony</u></b> already being sequential).

But the same could be said for ascending lines as well.

Another more modern use is to keep a static <b><u>harmony</u></b> above - the "chim chim cheree" progression - Cm - Cm/B - Cm/Bb - Cm/A etc. or the pop kind of similar thing that a lot of guitarists pick up, as in Cream's "White Room" (and Tales of Brave Ulysses) D5 - D5/C (or Cadd9) - Gadd9/B (or G/B) to Bb - then back, or on to A, etc.

The "25 or 6 to 4" progression (which is also similar to "Babe I'm Gonna Leave" by Led Zeppelin as well as Green Day's (ooh crap, I forgot to wake him up today) "Brain Stew" - though they avoid inversions in those progressions.

So yes, they may be over-represented, and there's plenty of historical precedent.

There's a great response in Fux's counterpoint book when the student asks why dissonances resolve downward, and the answer given is sort of "because that's how the masters did it" but he also adds his own guess - "because of gravity".

But there's a large body of sacred music that "ascends to heaven" that has upward moving progressions or melodies.

And in counterpoint, an upward moving melody can be balanced with a downward moving bass (to a point).

For fun, check this out:

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I agree with Chicken of the Year - it's simply fallen out of favor - for the time being.

You can certainly find it if you look for it - and there's that psychological thing that says once you start noticing it, you'll notice it even more. So your opinion might change.

 I think, as a *general trend* we can safely say that popular music still sticks *primarly* to diatonic chords and if anything, the blues influence gives us what equates to Mixolydian inflections probably as the most common "not Major/minor" thing.

Secondary Dominants are generally rarer than Borrowed Chords, but Borrowed chords are still generally (comparatively speaking) rare.

However, Secondary Dominants are more a product of Jazz influence (at least now) and whenever the trend is to have a "more jazzy" kind of style at the fore (or as a fad) you'll hear more of them. Borrowed chords are more part and parcel the "anti-classical" and "non-functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" or even "primitive" school, and when that style of music becomes more common (as was the case with Hair Metal in the 80s) you'll hear more Borrowed Chords.

What I've noticed is, as "Modern Country" has basically become the same thing as "Rock", it features far more Borrowed Chords (Sin Wagon by the Dixie Chicks, What Was I Thinking by Dierks Bentley) than "Classic Country" which was more likely to feature a Secondary chord for any non-diatonic (and non blues) chord.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, I'd excise negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> from your vocabulary to start.

The Coltrane changes are notorious. I would suggest you watch tons of videos on how various people approach them.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;. But ain't chords rather overrated?

They certainly are here.

&gt;A lot of mysteries about chords become much less mystic when you consider the voice leading.

Not necessarily. There are certainly instances, especially in the past, where voice-leading plays a crucial role, even the primary role in creating chord progressions - chord progressions are "resultant" of the voice leading. However, most modern chord progressions have little to do with voice leading - it's the reverse - any voice leading present is the result of the progression. We've come full circle.

&gt;So why are there so many posts about chords?

Maybe because it's emphasized in theory courses? Maybe because it's something people can grab on to as they can have more "rules" about them - unlike melodies - compare the amount of books on <b><u>Harmony</u></b> versus those on Melody - melody is much harder to define and, since it's really the melody that makes the song, chords are in fact not that important, so just repeating the same crap about them over and over is pretty convenient.

Of course, <b><u>harmony</u></b> could be a lot better too...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>How would it be notated?

Exactly like you have it. That's notation (yeah yeah, I know I'm being a smartass but you'll remember it now :-)

You can NAME this chord, but chord names don't tell you voicing. THey are EXACTLY like when we say a "C" chord. It could be C E G, it could be C G E, it could be C C E E G G C E G C up the keyboard.

If the root is A, it's A something.

it IS an Am(add9).

There is no 7th.

But you have to understand, you can't put Am(add2) or Am(add9) into a score and expect anyone to play this voicing at all. That's not what chord names are for.

You put Am(add9) and they'll play A, C, E, B in some order (and if there's a bass playing the A, they may or may not put the A on bottom, or even opt to leave it out).

If you put "add2" instead, it would imply to some people that the B is lower in the structure, so they might play A-B-C-E, but again, that ain't what you got on the page.

That's what notation is for. If you want to tell people exactly what notes to play in a specific voicing, then write it out on standard staff notation as you've done.

Chord Symbols (names) are simply to tell someone what the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is. They will voice it however they see fit, because that's the whole point of using Chord Symbols to begin with. In fact, they may even add extra notes, or leave out others, or totally reharmonize it.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>V-I or V-i is an Authentic Cadence.

It doesn't matter if the V is "emebllished" with non-chord tones.

V^4-3 to V is "V" just like I^6/4 to V is all "V" - it's all a Dominant Functioning <b><u>Harmony</u></b> moving to a Tonic <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, which is an Authentic Cadence.

Simply a 4-3 suspension in the V chord.

The other things are out of the Common Practice Period standards where there are names for such cadences.

But what you're missing here is "resolve" is not "cadence".

Vsus4 - V is only a cadence if the resolution occurs at a cessation of harmonic motion, phrase ending, etc.

Likewise, if the V resolves to something else as a cadence, then the Vsus4 is of no consequence - it's not part of the cadence.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Most C/D *in music* is contextual.

So, a B and C sounding together are all the same level of dissonance as far as something like Common Practice practices would be. Say it were part of an implied Cmaj7 chord, the B would need to resolve down to A in any of those spacings - if you like, simply because it's a note and its dissonant 7th.

Also, in CPP, there's a distinction between dissonance and chord tone - a consonant note, such as an A over a C, would be considered a non-chord tone if the <b><u>harmony</u></b> was an implied C, so it would need to resolve despite its being a consonance.

Now, I suppose colloquially, we would say that a m2 is probably "harsher" than a M7 and that increasing the distance further generally lessons the dissonance.

But that's sort of not unlike saying that adding the 3rd E, to a M7 C-B interval softens it as well. Again, contextual.

Most people would probably also say that a M7 interval from the C below the bass staff up to B, versus middle C up to B is going to be "more dissonant" or at least "less pleasant" - and if that's how we define dissonance, then there you go.

Then we get into questions like, what if the volume of the two notes is different? What if it's Oboe on the B and Flute on the C, both on their lowest notes?

Are muted trumpets playing m2s as annoying as two piccolos doing the same thing?

Here's another odd thing - you said 4, but really you could have larger compound intervals.

How would the lowest B on the piano sound with the highest C, or the lowest C with the highest B? Piano tuners use something called Stretch Tuning, so the octaves are all a bit wide - meaning that highest B is going to be closer to a C than the B right above the lowest C!

And what about various tunings? In 12tet, we could argue that a Perfect 5th, being somewhat "detuned" as compared to Just Intonation, is not as consonant as the one in JI.

IMHO, it's best not to place too much importance on objective consonance or dissonance if such a thing even exists (many will argue it does, and there's research to document it, but it has little impact on the way music has been written).

IOW, composers use C/D based on stylistic considerations and most of the time in spite of any objective measure. The Perfect 4th is the great example, having been consonant, then dissonant, then dissonant in certain contexts, consonant in others, then consonant again. So it doesn't matter if the JI 4th is different from the 12tet 4th, or if the 4th is objectively consonant - people use it how they see fit, and how their world's style typically uses it.

One final further consideration is I kind of get a chuckle out of the number of people who get really into this for intervals, and I'm like, knowing music, barely any of it is only 2 note intervals, and most of the time if it is, they fly by in a way that none of that stuff matters outside of stylistic practice again. So that's in addition to the fact that we use them how we want whether they're dissonant or not!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So let's take a song like "Iron Man" by Black Sabbath.

After the intro, it gets into the main "melody" of the song, played on guitar. This is played as chords, what we call "Power chords". The bass plays the exact same thing as the lowest note of the guitar chord, 1 octave down. When Ozzy starts to sing, he is singing the same note that the bass is playing, and the guitar actually switches to just single notes, and plays the same thing - each part is an octave up from the other part - bass - up to guitar, up to ozzy (actually he's up a couple octaves).

If you take a song like "25 or 6 to 4" by Chicago, a similar thing happens at the beginning - the guitar is playing chords, and the bass is doing the same thing as the lowest note of the guitar chords, an octave down.

But then the horn players come in.

Now, while the guitar plays an A chord, the bass plays an A note, and the horns play an Am chord, so each player has either an A, a C, or E note, or some combination.

But, the horns also play a melody that moves around to other notes that are not part of the chord. When the vocals come in, they too are doing a melody that has some of the chord notes in it, but it also uses other notes from the KEY.

So, to make a simple song, you could have a bass playing the same notes as what guitar chords are named:

G - Em - C - D is the chords the guitar plays, so the bass could play G-E-C-D as notes, the same duration the guitar's chords are.

If a keyboard were to play along, it WOULD play the same chords as the guitar, but not necessarily in the same VOICING, which means the guitar player might play a chord on all 6 strings consisting of 6 notes, while the keyboard player might just play 3 of those notes - and they don't have to be in the same octave. A keyboard player could also play the same exact low note as the bass player with their left hand if they wanted. A 2nd guitar player could play more of the same exact chords (in order) but voice them differently as well.

So everyone in the group plays the same "chord progression", but since chords are made up of multiple notes, they might play one of the chord's notes, 2, 3, or more, depending on their typical role, or the sound they want.

But, music is not made solely of chord progressions. It usually has melodic elements too. You can make a melody from the notes of a chord ("on top of old smokey") but they are very often (most often probably) made from SCALE TONES, or the notes of the KEY.

So, for example, a C chord has the notes C E and G in it and a singer could sing those notes in order while the chord was being played in other instruments.

But, if the song was in the KEY of C Major, they might sing C-D-E-D.

Think of "we don't need no, education" by Pink Floyd - it's D-E-F-E, D-E-F-E, in the key of Dm, which is the underlying <b><u>harmony</u></b> - the guitar often strums a Dm chord, and the bass plays a line underneath that's different, but also has notes from Dm. (the song is actually Dorian, but that's kind of advanced).

Take a song like "Play that Funky Music (White Boy)" by Wild Cherry, and it has a guitar riff that uses notes from Em, a bass line that uses notes from Em, and some chords above that are essentially an E13 chord, but also include some notes that are not part of the chord nor in the key - and it just stays on that same "E" <b><u>harmony</u></b> for a very long time.

So as long as everyone's in the key, or playing notes of the same chord, it will generally sound good together.

There's more to it than that, but that's kind of the simple explanation.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; since youre a professor. What kind of exercises do you have your students do as homework, to help them practice what they learn, so that it goes into their long term memory? Just applying theory to songs they like? Or maybe more specific exercise sets? Maybe a workbook or a textbook with exercises that you could recommend for me?

Well, because I'm at the university level most students coming in are fairly proficient at an instrument they've studied usually at least through high school who know how to read music and have a general grasp of keys and scales already.

So we don't really start "at the beginning" so to speak.

However, I have taught "fundamentals of music" courses which do sort of start from square one.

Really, you can kind of look at most theory textbooks' tables of content and follow the order there and that's what you need to work on.

If you don't know your notes, that's where you start. If you don't know your scales, then you need to get that next. Intervals are next. Then chords.  You also have to learn your Keys and Key Signatures.

For example, a question that will often come up after your initial question is, "now I know that everyone plays from the same <b><u>harmony</u></b>...WHICH harmonies to I pick?"

And the answer is, to begin, the Diatonic Chords in a Key. So that's something you have to learn too. And again, to know that, you have to know your Keys and Key Signatures and Scales, so you know which notes are Diatonic, and you have to know how to make chords. So it all kind of works together.

Theory courses in college use workbooks in combination with the textbook for a student to "practice" each concept. A college student could expect to spend a week or two doing assignments with hundreds of intervals - naming given intervals, writing a note above or below a given note for the requested interval, and so on.

One of the problems I see at places like this is, a lot of people just want to read a few pages on intervals, and then expect to know them, and it doesn't work that way. You'll forget it if you don't use it every day. And it like math classes - you were always given that homework like "do all the odd numbers on page 35" after you learned the concept in class. You have to practice them.

_____

Applying theory to songs you like is not a good idea, because many people like music that has very little theory in them. A vast amount of music out there is like teaching people Grammar by only exposing them to Dick and Jane books (I'm being a little facetious here for effect). Sure, we could name notes and chords and so on, but, for example, a lot of modern pop music doesn't use Major and Minor scales the way they "originate" and are really - what's a good word...bastardizations of them.

So it's really hard to teach theory using music people may like - since everyone likes different things. Instead, we have to go to music that constantly and repeatedly exhibits what we're trying to teach. Which is "Common Practice Period" music - because there was a Common Practice, it makes it easier to see these things in action, because virtually all of the music written at this time (Classical music essentially) does this stuff. If you pick some Rap song with lyrics that are more spoken than sung, and nothing but a drum beat, you can't really talk about melody, or <b><u>harmony</u></b>, only rhythm, so, maybe unfortunately, we have to work with music a lot of times people don't like. But it's like your vegetables - they're good for you.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, SATB implies 4 voices.

A 6 voice chord would have to be SS A TT B or something.

But, here are the general rules:

In 4 part writing, for root position triads, the root should be doubled (RR35). There are a few common rare exceptions where the 3rd may be doubled (R335) or where the 5th is omitted and the root TRIPLED (RRR3 - usually a final chord only). Sometimes, the 3rd or more commonly, the 5th will be doubled for voice-leading concerns or to do something like imitate a melodic line in another point, but in general, for root position TRIADS, double the Root.

In first inversion triad, any note could be doubled. There are specific ones that mean not all doublings are possible, but in most cases all are possibilities (RR35, R335, R355). It's pretty rare for a first inversion triad to be incomplete (missing any of its notes) but again musical circumstances could dictate a doubling like 2 roots and 2 3rds and no 5th, or 3 roots and a 3rd (assuming all of these will have at least 1 3rd in the bass voice since they're in first inversion!).

In 2nd inversion triads, rarely is anything doubled other than the 5th of the chord.

This means, we could say, in Root  Position, and 2nd Inversion, double the Bass note. In First Inversion, double the Bass note, but any are possible.

The exceptions are, don't double the Leading Tone (so you can't double the root of a vii^o triad, nor can you double the 5th of a iii6/4 chord, and so on), and don't double active tones (chordal 7ths, chromatic alterations, etc.).

For 7th chords, Root position 7th chords are either R357, or RR37, or rarely, RR57. The 7 is never (exceptions would be extremely rare, and only for certain excepted musical contexts) doubled as it is an active tone, and the 3rd is rarely doubled as it can also be an active tone.

Inverted 7th chords are rarely incomplete in 4 parts.

When you add more parts it largely depends on voice-leading. But for example, if you add a 5th voice, any chord that you might have used as incomplete in the instances above could now add back in the 5th of the chord for example.

Otherwise, the first thing that would be doubled would be the Root, than the 5th. Again, never the 7th, or the Leading Tone (note, the 5th of the iii chord doesn't always act like a leading tone so it could be doubled then).

_______

Remember, there's another type of "doubling" we might call "reinfocement doubling" where a line is doubled either at the unison or an octave or 2 above and/or below.

So, for example, a 2nd alto might double a bass part in octaves, while the rest of the texture continues in 4 part counterpoint.

So you could double anything for reinforcement reasons, but when doing it and still trying to maintain independent parts, you're probably going to find it has to shift around from chord to chord (which is why often, 5 part or greater <b><u>harmony</u></b> often uses more complex harmonies so there are more different notes to play with and not as many to double).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>They're probably pretty expensive - I would recommend something like "Master Theory" which is graded and probably more cost effective like 5-10 bucks a piece.

Check out this:

http://www.theperfectutor.org/Mckinley%20High%20School/master_theory_lessons.htm

You could look for things like that, then post images and ask here if you got them right or not, so you can learn from your mistakes.

Most textbooks have a workbook as well, like so:

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Schoenberg has two texts on <b><u>harmony</u></b> - Theory of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, and then Structural Functions of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

The first is comprehensive. Exhaustive even. Exhausting! Idiosyncrative is a good word for it!

You know, it's really hard to recommend a text without knowing exactly what you're trying to get at.

It's kind of like saying, "well, I'm interested in French Cooking, should I get "Le Bonne Table" or "Gastronomique" " - when I don't even read French.

What you'll get out of any of these really depends on where you are with your knowledge already.

Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is designed primarily as a classroom text for use in college theory courses (I checked out an older AP test and everything on it is covered in K/P so I'm not sure where Vornska is getting their feelings from, but high school theory teachers are notorious for not being solid in theory no matter what text they use - but certainly, for example, the Secondary Dominant notation for one answer is cleary in line with K/P, but some other texts don't use that notation).

You now, if you want a good read on <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, I would look at Walter Piston's "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>". It's still sometimes used as a college text (though rarely) and has been updated by Mark deVoto. 

But it's very "readable".

K/P is more of a "this is how it's done, here's an example, now do it" kind of approach - which is great for the classroom but for just "reading" it's not so great. But you know - none of them are really designed for just reading.

The early Schoenberg is very wordy, kind of "old fashioned" in approach, and more of a "historical curiosity".

I'm not familiar with the later text, but if the style and language is similar, I'll save it for when I have insomnia.

Do this, get Walter Piston's "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>", "Counterpoint" and "Orchestration" and you'll have 3 nice introductory books that are not really necessarily authoritative (none are really) but are readable, not as expensive as the "industry standards" and more useful as just a "pick up and reference something" kind of book, for familiarizing yourself with these things.

Then, if you're so inclined, you might look at Robert Gauldin's "Harmonic Practice in Tonal Music" and "A Practical Approach to 18th Century Counterpoint" (18th, not 16th - he wrote two with similar titles).

The thing is, most of us who are interested in these things have 10 or 12 or more books on each subject, or access to them in a library, and so on. And reading all the different perspectives and approaches becomes more informative than just one single book or approach.

The "biggies" for Classroom Use in colleges tend to be:

K/P 

Aldwell/Schacter

Clendennin/Marvin (which I actually found their book and workbook to be more "modernized" and "user friendly" on the whole, but it's not as widely used as those other two - though I see it mentioned a lot so it must be gaining ground).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Why do people say ' this piece is in F minor' and not ' this piece is in F melodic minor'? Is there something wrong with the latter description?

Yes.

A scale is a listing of pitches, typically in ascending order (the root of the word, "scale" is like scaling a wall - "to climb") that are "important" in some way, often starting on a note that is more important, or a reference point, etc.

A Key is a "concept".

Now, the key of A Major contains the notes A B C# D E F# and G#, which when listed that way, we call an "A Major Scale".

But a better way to understand it is that music is "in a key" and that key contains notes we list in a scale. Think about the alphabet. It's just a listing of letters we use in the language. "Key" is more like the concept of "word" - it carries definition, meaning, and so on, while "D-O-G" are just a listing of the letters in the word "dog". But those letters don't really have any meaning outside of the context of the known word.

Minor Keys in traditional music are more complex than major keys and really are best understood as something that has 7 notes, but two of them have variable states, depending on need.

So, for example, the Key of D minor has a scale we can list as well:

D E F G A Bb C

But two of those notes may be varied for either a Harmonic purpose, or a Melodic purpose. C may be altered to C#, so some of the chords containing that note may take on a Dominant function in the key. If you like, that's like capitalizing something in a sentence so it becomes a noun. Taking a Family Guy joke I just heard, "I like to sleep with candy" has a different meaning than "I like to sleep with Candy".

This is something a lot of people don't understand, but there's no such thing as a imM7 in tonal music, nor a III+. That's because the adjustment of scale degree 7 is ONLY made on chords that can assume a Dominant function. "I Can sleep with candy" doesn't really change the function of "can" in any meaningful way other than make it confusing.

When raised scale degree 7 is used, in order to avoid an augmented interval, scale degree 6 was also raised - which happened in Melodic contexts. 

This also bothers me because no one ever seems to ask the one question they SHOULD be asking about all this - why is "Melodic Minor" different going up than going down.

Well, the real answer, it's not really a scale! It's a made up thing. It's really a mnemonic device simply to illustrate what generally (generally mind you) in MELODIC patterns in traditional minor key music.

Now, all of that said, Jazz players and other people seemed to have misinterpreted how these things worked and either through ignorance or true artistry, or a combination of the two, they have in fact made pieces "in Harmonic Minor" or "in Melodic Minor" (which is better called "Jazz Minor" because it only uses the ascending form both direction).

But, as one of the more recent responses to the thread you linked to says, in jazz people are often applying "chord scale theory" where a "known scale" is used to restrict note choices to a particular pitch collection to give a particular "flavor" for a given note. It's kind of like using the wrong word but still getting the meaning across, in a more emphatic way, like "That slimy dog ate my candy". Dogs are generally not slimy. Likewise, people even use "synthetic" scales, based on principles from other scales, such as "rotations" of these synthetic scales which are considered "modes". So you could make up a word - "That rackajammin dog ate my candy" or you could take a word we well know, and "rotate" it to change the sound a bit, "That uckingfay dog ate my candy".

THe thing that I always say here, which people don't expound upon enough IMHO, is that really they're using scales because they are trying to justify what they're using. You can't just say, "hey, I'm using a random 5 notes here". But if you pull a "named scale" - "hey I'm using the pentatonic" ooh, ahh. If you use F-G-A-C-D over a C chord in the key of C, sure, you are "using the F Major Pentatonic" but REALLY, what's going on is the pitch collection is just being limited to these particular notes to give a particular sound to the improvisation (note, this is in the oh-so-typical context where the <b><u>harmony</u></b> itself is drawn from the full pitch collective) Other "scales" are used to just restrict the full chromatic to something like a Whole Tone scale, or diminished scale, and so on.
_______

But that's Jazz. And it's not really widespread in any other type of key-based music. So what most people are talking about is generally traditional major and minor, and harmonic and melodic minor are if you like, subsets of the minor scale (not that it's a "set" in terms of collection, but just "subscales" as alterations of the "main" scale).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not many probably. As I mentioned in response to the other poster, you could have a 9/8 suspension over a first inversion chord, but it would be rare as the resolution would be doubled, though it could possibly move on (suspension with change of bass - thus change of <b><u>harmony</u></b>).


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No not usually.

If you're covering a tune by someone, and they sing E, and you sing A instead, it will only work if the chord is an A chord (or a few other things)

Also, depending on where it starts and ends, and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> in general, it will change the melody enough so people will know it's wrong.

The way to do this would be to lower EVERYONE's notes a 5th - so everyone plays in a different key.


You could sing an OCTAVE lower, but sometimes this comes off as cheesy.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It is a remnant of earlier systems.

Way back when, only 7 notes existed and prior to that, there was a system in use by the Greeks that used a 4 note system where groups of 4 notes were stacked to produce 7 notes sets (one note would be shared between the two 4 note groups).

The Greek system used Enharmonic, Chromatic, and Diatonic Tetrachords (recognize those words?) to produce what we eventually call "Modes". By combining the tetrachords in different ways they could produce unique strings of notes, which they then melded into one system called the Greater Perfect System (which began on a Gamma and ended on something like Ut and that's where we get the word still in use today - Gamut - meaning, "the whole range" of something - it runs the Gamut!).

What happened in Western Music is theoreticians at some point tried to codify what they were doing (which had evolved from that) and used the Greek names for their Modes to their own modes, but they didn't quite get the patterns right (the Greeks also figured their  modes from the top down).

Nonetheless, a system of 8 Ecclesiastical Modes developed (which was a categorization of they way modes were being used in music at that time).

These consisted of 4 Authentic Modes and 4 Plagal Modes -the Authentic ones you've probably heard of - Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, and Mixolydian. The Plagal versions of the modes all had a "Hypo-"prefix, like Hypodorian.

Now, why they started altering them is a mystery. Simply put, they just got tired of one sound and tried a new one. This system largely grew up in vocal music so one of the first reasons was to avoid the interval of the Tritone, the so-called "Devil's Interval" (remember, this was happening in the church). There was a practice of "Musica Ficta" or "false music" where notes would be altered to avoid the tritone, which at first apparently was just something done in practice without being notated (so we don't know when it really started) but started later getting written in as what we now know as a flat note.

As things evolved, we got to <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and when putting two voices together, again to avoid the tritone, one voice would need to be altered. Then they realized that in doing so you could create transposed versions of modes (originally, Dorian was on D period, but by using one flat, you could transpose it to G Dorian and so on). This ultimately led to a principle of "Mutation" and one person, Guido D'Arezzo came up with a system of "Hexachordal Mutation" which gives us the names for B and Bb - "Hard B" and "Soft B" as it were - which is why in German they still use "H" for B, and "b" for Bb (notice that a lower case H would have "hard" or "square" corners - and that evolves into the natural sign - while the lower case b has "soft" or "rounded" corners).

As time still went on, people started liking to have cadences that had a half step between one of the notes leading to the final and the final itself. This happens naturally in some modes like Phrygian or Lydian, but not in the others. So they started raising (sharp) the 7th scale degree if it wasn't already raised.

So we started of with 7 notes, and then over time, started using these alterations to get other notes. FWIW, prior to the tonal era, only Bb, Eb, F#, and C# were very common. It took a long time for G#, Ab, D#, Db, and so on to get used (more in the later Renaissance period).

The "names" for notes changed over time. Boethius for example called them A-O. IIRC, in Pope Gregory's time, they were A-G, then aa-gg, for the next octave (which was way things were listed in olden days - using letters instead of numbers). Guido came up with the whole Ut Re Mi thing later, but in Spanish and French for example, the note names are still Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti - and English Speakers seem to have taken it from German, but use "B" for B, and "Bb" for B-flat.

But remember - aside from Guido there were only 7 notes to be named - A B C D E F G. So there weren't really "12" notes yet, no matter which naming system they used.

The idea of 12 notes in an octave really evolves during the Renaissance and it basically just allowed people to get these other "ficta" notes on instruments like keyboards and lutes. However, they were also experimenting with other tunings at that time and some people developed keyboards with more than 12 notes per octave!

But basically, during the Baroque period, "Well Tempering" evolved to go along with the **Tonal** system which, rather than having 8 (then later, 12) different modes for different flavors, had just 2 modes (Major and Minor) but could transpose them to various **Keys** for different flavors. So as composers wrote in keys more, they wanted to be able to modulate to other keys more as well within a composition, so they had to come up within tunings that allowed them to do that.

So while the concept of an 8ve divided into 12 notes had been around for a long time, it wasn't really used like that until the later Renaissance and into the Baroque period, and it took a while for us to come up with what we now primarily use, which is an 8ve *equally divided* into 12 chromatic notes - which allow us to play equally in any key.

Why do sharps and flats exist? Because more is better, and we wanted more notes over time - us greedy humans :-)

And they're not "named" as "their own letters" because they gradually evolved within a letter system that already existed, and weren't "primary" notes, but rather *alterations* of them (i.e., not "new" notes "worth naming" as they saw it).

Staff Notation evolved alongside of this - with it. So the staff was designed for the "plain notes" and notes were altered with a symbol so they didn't move to a line or space that was another note.

Every day, someone decides that music is too hard to read for them (boo hoo) and they go to great lengths to devise a "new" system that's "better" from their perspective - because they know nothing about how all this evolved. Of course, people have been trying to do this for a very long time but it never catches on, because notation and music evolve together and if anything, new notations are the result of new musical practices - so until there's a new trend in music to call all 12 notes different things, there's not going to be any need to come up with a notation system that reflects that. That doesn't keep people from trying though.

So they think they're "making it easier" but they're not - it's already as easy as it can be - millennia of evolution to make it work the way we need it to work. Anything else is not taking into account the big picture and actually usually less effective.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, really, it's all 1 function.

It's just a Dominant chord.

There is no "iii6".

Instead, it's basically all a V chord with embellishments.

But, as you've noted, one of those can be "named" a I6/4 chord. But really that first "iii6" thing is serving the same purpose. It's pretty much all a "V <b><u>harmony</u></b>" with embellishments, which is what a I6/4 is as well in this kind of situation - one of the embellishments that just happens to spell out a chord. The "iii" is really another I6/4 type chord (though of course the C note is absent, it still has this basic function).

So pushed, you would call it I6/4 - V7 - I6/4 - V but "really" it's all just a V7 "idea" and that's it's "purpose" or function.

Some people will do stuff like label the individual chords, then put a bracket under all four of them and just put "V" to show that the whole measure is basically "dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b>".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hmmm. You're on the right track but...

Let's say that Tonality "proper" (Tonality with a T) is somewhat like what you say: It has a Tonal Center, and is in one of two modes (Major or Minor).

So a way to say the way it is conceptualized is:

Key of C, Major Mode.

and

Key of C, Minor Mode.

In Tonality (proper), Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> "leads to" the Tonic <b><u>Harmony</u></b> (it could be just a note, but we do consider the <b><u>harmony</u></b> to be part of that).

Now, what seems to be confused maybe is that in the system, Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is the same.

In fact, in Minor Keys, the chords are altered so that they follow the same functionality as in Major Keys.

Harmonies "progress" from one "function" to another, in a hierarchy that produces "progression" towards the Tonic goal. Also, these progressions are also responsible for creating that Tonic goal.

So, IOW, it's simply not the set of notes alone, or the "order" they appear in, but how harmonic motion progresses - how it implies the key center and mode, and then confirms it by known patterns like cadences.

So the best example of this is the Minor mode, where if left to it's "natural" state would have a tendency to drift towards Major (or towards the III chord) because those are the same sounds as functional progressions in Major.

IOW, we don't want to use the progression VI - VIII - III in minor, because it's going to sound like the more powerful IV - V - I in the relative major.

So instead, we alter the V and VII chords so they'll become functional to over-ride this otherwise natural tendency, and "re-direct" the music towards the minor tonic goal.

Now, you could use the word "tonality" to broadly describe any kind of set of notes where a central pitch or <b><u>harmony</u></b> is promoted as most important, or the goal, etc. but really, the only "tonalities" with functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> are Keys - Major and Minor.

A Dorian mode piece can be *treated as if it were* functional or a "tonality" as it were, but really, it's a separate thing. All pre-tonal modes do not operate the same way as Tonality - they don't have "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" and that's really one of the major things that separates Tonality from Modality (the pre-Tonal kind of Modality).

Modern "tonality" and any "modality" is really more an admixture of some concepts from tonality and modality, but really different than both. "Centric" music is a better term for music that establishes a note or <b><u>harmony</u></b> "center", but does so through various other means than functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

IOW, most modern "tonality" doesn't use functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and in the strictest sense of the word, if it doesn't have functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, it can't be Tonality (with a capital T :-)

Therefore, "centers" have to - MUST be - created by some other means. You're write, if you're writing in Lydian, it's going to gravitate to whatever its Ionian mode would be.

So we can't use "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" that points to Ionian, and we can't easily "overlay" functional progressions - for example, a II-V-I in G Lydian is going to be A-D-G - which is going to sound like the key of D. It's same problem as Minor above.

Now, in the pre-Tonal days, (before Major and Minor even existed) they actually had similar problems of one mode just losing its identity and drifting towards another (though no single one was prominent in the way we see Major today). So they kind of did the same thing we did with minor in the Tonal era, which as to alter the cadences.

But in something like Lydian, the problem is, the cadence is already a V-I so it doesn't help us.

And, once the Major-minor system became the more prevalent one, if we want to write in Lydian we actually try our damnedest not to make it sound ANYTHING like major. So we wouldn't want to alter the V7 - which would be D MAJOR 7 - because that destroys the character of the mode and just basically turns it back into something we already know as V/V - V7 - I (A to D7 to G). This is so familiar to us with Tonality, that it's going to "neuter" and Modal progressions we try to make.

So we need a "new functionality" or "alternate functionality" for Modes. We could say, they're simply "not functional" but really they're just not using Tonal functionality in most cases.

Instead we have to use progressions that are CLEARLY modal and definitely NOT tonal. This is easier in Phrygian, but a great example which has caused many an online argument is Sweet Home Alabama - is it G Major, or D Mixolydian? There's evidence to support both but the important part is, it's ambiguous because they didn't do anything to really clearly indicate which it was (and they probably didn't care).

But if someone were to set out today to write a "Mixolydian Etude" for Flute and Piano, they would not want to use just I-ii or I-IV as their progression, and they certainly wouldn't want to never play scale degree 7 in their progression.

It's scale degree 7 (b7) that makes it "not major".

But, rather than it orienting to whatever Ionian it might be (Like C Mixolydian could sound like F Major) we have to use harmonic progressions to make C (in this example) the Center.

And we can't do that by using the iii^o chord, because it's going to sound WAY to much like a vii^o chord - and if it move to IV, it's all over as that will sound like vii^o - I - a defining Tonal cadence (and iii to IV is a common tonal functional progression too, so you can't "overlay" a Tonal progression on a mode and have it help you a lot of times).

Now, we can just beat the listener over the head with C7 - Tonic I7. We can drone it and have Mixolydian melodies above.

We can actually "overlay" I - IV - v (minor v) because this is a functional progression that "works" because the v is minor (not a Dominant function chord) so it "keeps it modal".

It's the same way today as a lot of people just write in "natural minor" without the functional dominant stuff, because by using things like looped progressions that always return to the i chord, we don't need the functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> to point us to the tonic - having it in a strong phrase position (always starting a phrase/loop for example) gives it the "power" necessary to become the tonal center.

So, while we could alter Modes to function similarly to the way Minor KEYS work (with alterations to make V and VII into dominant chords to keep it from drifting towards III) we don't usually, because the whole Major/minor system is so ingrained in us. We are "indoctrinated" to conceptualize everything from a major/minor standpoint (and for many, just a major standpoint!).

Instead, we try to focus on other methods besides "functional" or "functions borrowed from tonality" to create the Central tone or chord.

So in effect, they do have different rules, because we are so conditioned to hear these progressions as pointing to major, we have to do something to thwart that, but unlike minor, which we can thwart by altering two chords, V and VII, other modes have to be thwarted another way - repetition of the center, prominent use of the center, progressions that are "anti-Tonal" and definitively modal, and so on.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"Appoggiatura Chord" usually refers to the notes of a V7 <b><u>harmony</u></b> that are rhythmically displaced to appear on a strong beat and then resolve into the tonic chord on a weak beat, usually like so:

F - | F - E

B - | B - C

D - |D - C

G - |C - C

Notice the chord after the barline | is a "what the heck chord is this" kind of chord. But what it is simply is a G7 over C, held over from the previous G7 chord (or rearticulated). F-F-E is a suspension, B-B-C is a retardation, and D-D-C is a suspension. In some forms, any of those notes could also be an accented passing tone, accented neighbor tone (which are often lumped in as appoggiature) or appoggiature proper.

It can of course appear in other places, but the Dominant with Tonic Bass to Tonic chord is probably the most obvious model to use as the "textbook" example (I see a lot of examples online that are really just a single app. or maybe a pair of notes that I would consider just non-chord tones - the "app chord" proper (or as the term is usually used) refers more specifically to a 3 note or more triad or implied 7th chord that is often a nameable chord (sometimes not) over the bass note of the chord all the notes are resolving to).

Give the measure number and specific piece, or take a picture and post it and it will be far easier to tell.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Depends how broadly you're using "classification".

More people would probably say Consonant <b><u>Harmony</u></b> versus Dissonant <b><u>Harmony</u></b>.

*definition* wise, it's simply "more than one different pitch sounding simultaneously".

FWIW, not all music styles that have <b><u>harmony</u></b> use Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. So it's not all-encompassing in that regard.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>D# A C would be D# diminished 7th without its 3rd (assumed to be F#).

It could also be C^o7 without its 5th but we probably wouldn't think of it that way after Am, unless we already knew F# (note) was in the key and had heard it recently so we'd probably hear it as Cm6 without its 5th (G).

But the way you have it, it may just have more of a bluesy inflection where the E of the Am chord (the lower one) simply moves down to the Blue note Eb. So it might be heard as much as a melodic tone or even separate bass line under an otherwise static <b><u>harmony</u></b> in some contexts. Depends on how it's played in a piece.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hmm. Here's the thing - "as far as you're going to get by reading" is probably reading the first page.

Music Theory is like Math - you can read the description of how addition works, but then what you need to do is all the odd numbered exercises on pages 58 and 59 and be graded on them and see if you're doing it right!

IOW, you have to also APPLY and "practice" theory like you would Math in a math class. And, your best bet for doing that is by studying with a teacher, and ideally, studying an instrument and learning theory alongside those studies.

Otherwise, it's not going to stick.

Now, if you have a pretty thorough grounding already, you might get more out of it.

All theory books are pretty much the same. They even have an Idiots and a Dummies version, and those both are just about the same as the other texts (and lots cheaper!) so you can't dumb it down but so much. But again it's not something you can really "read to learn".

And each concept builds on the previous ones (like math again) so the tendency for people is to "read chapter 1" and then say, "ok, I got that" and then go on to chapter 2 and read it, and so on, then realizing by chapter 4 or 5 that they're totally lost and nothing makes sense.

IOW, theory texts are really designed to be used in a classroom setting working with an instructor. I'm not saying you can't teach yourself theory - some people have probably certainly done it just like some people have certainly taught themselves math from a book. But when they do that, they're able to self-check, practice, apply, and so on as well. Not just read through them so to speak.

And they're also really intended as references as well. You can grab it off the shelf and go back to a concept you weren't sure about. And because each author has a different approach, and they make good references, most people who are into theory actually own more than one - so there's no one "bible" or  - as the marketing might suggest, "complete" books - they might cover everything from basic math to advanced calculus or whatever the most advanced math is, but again, I doubt most people are going to learn calculus by starting reading at page 1 and reading through to the end of the book.

So really, they're all about equal in that regard. Will you be getting the workbooks too, and have some means of checking your work? If not, something like the Idiot's guide (that's not an insult of course, it's a very popular series and well done) or even Walter Piston's "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>" or Schoenberg's "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>" which can be found far cheaper would be good to have. Better yet, there are tons of links and suggestions in the FAQ and down on the sidebar for free internet resources. If you're starting at beginner, you really should start there, learn as much as you can, and then buy an over-priced textbook if you so desire!

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Because the music most guitarists wanted to play necessitated a tuning which allowed them to play both <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody and common musical patterns (chord formations, etc.) at the time.

"Standard Tuning" for Guitar really evolved in the Classical Era and more especially in the Romantic Period when what we now call "Classical Guitar" was more standardized then ever before, as was music for it.

Prior to that, Guitar as we know it stemmed from two primary sources - Spanish Viheula (which closely resembles modern guitar) and the Lute, used in Elizabethan England, France, etc.

There was a time when tunings were not standardized and tuning was varied based on the need of pieces, or which mode pieces were in etc. (other instruments, like Appalachian Dulcimer for example, are modal, and can be tuned to create different modes) and people even made a distinction between "Accords Anciens" (old tuning) and "Accords Nouveaux" (new tuning).

Lute is generally tuned like a modern guitar, in 4ths, with a 3rd between two of the strings. To a modern guitarist, the common Lute tuning looks like a standard guitar tuning with an extra string above the high E (tuned to A). Lutes also had additional low strings that were usually tuned to what we'd now see as, the Low E string, another string for what we'd now consider Drop D, and even lower (and some instruments like Theorbo were similar but with neck extensions for even lower notes that weren't fretted).

A lot of Lute music has been transcribed for guitar, and if we tune or G string down to F#, it gives the same interval structure as the upper strings of Lute so you'll actually still see this in a lot of modern publications for classical guitar. Likewise, you'll run into Drop D transcriptions as well.

Vihuela music also evolved - there were 4 course, and 5 course Vihuelas and even things like "re-entrant" tuning which is more like Ukulele - where a lower string is actually tuned higher.

But over time it got closer and closer to Lute tuning, which both got closer and closer to standard tuning.

In the early Baroque Period (and late Renaissance) Lute read Tabluature, but composers like Bach were writing more complex polyphonic music for it and eventually there was a move towards standard notation. By the Classical Era - and especially into the Romantic Period where music publishing was becoming a major financial industry, it just became necessary for Guitarists to both write in standard notation - so they could sell more music! That's why we see a lot of things like popular opera Arias arranged for guitar or treated as Theme and Variations - guitar composers themselves (Carcassi, Sor, Giuliani, Carulli, etc.) had to be able to read and write standard notation to both stay competitive and make more money selling music!

The other big thing that happens and part of the reason the Lute and Vihulea kind of get replaced by the Guitar is the move from instrumental music in the Renaissance being more of a "lesser" form, to it becoming an equal or even predominant form in the Baroque and especially Classical periods, which also coincided with a move away from Modality into Tonality.

So all the modal tunings sort of gave way to the Major/minor system, which necessitated fewer tunings (and by the time we get well-temperament, we don't need adjustable frets and things like that) and what we now called "standard tuning" was sort of the best compromise to work for the musical system in place.

It does allow for chordal playing. if you compare to Violin, which is tuned in 5ths rather than primarily 4ths, Violins weren't really chordal and used more for playing melodies and individual parts, and because of their size (scale length) and playing angle of the hand, using 4 fingers per string to cover the span of a 5th is quite practical.

Notice that Double Bass by comparison is tuned in 4ths - because the scale length is so much greater it has to have fewer notes in one position before moving to another string.

While Lute scale lengths (and older Viheulas) were shorter, they weren't really as short ad violins and playing higher led to tuning issues, so more strings with less distance between them worked better - and allowed for chords.

So by the time all these factors come together, the "Classical" guitar became standardized with what we now call standard tuning, with exceptions here and there (there are even Dropped D and Dropped G (A string tuned down as well) pieces).

In the later 19th century, when music for guitar was becoming ever more demanding (Paganini, many of the later guitar Virtuosi) tuning started to get changed for fuller sound, and we even see in the 20th century guitarists using 7 and 8 or more stringed guitar to enable them to play transcriptions from Romantic Period piano works, or orchestral works, or to be able to compose for guitar that way. And in the 20th century, people got even more experimental.

Many guitarists coming from a pop music perspective today may learn about Drop D, DADGAD, open tunings, or 7 string guitars for example, but none of this is new. It's actually ancient at this point!

But, basically what happened was that in the "Common Practice Period" which includes Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods, as well as popular music in the 20th century, had so much music written for standard tuning on Guitar, and so much music could be easily transcribed to standard tuning (even earlier music!) that it became the "default" tuning that allowed players to play the most amount of music with the least amount of hassle.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ok, long answer.

"Music Theory" is really a broad range of inter-related subjects.

We can break it down into a couple of categories:

1. Music Fundamentals - this is "the basics" - knowing Key Signatures, understanding Scales, Chords, and Intervals, and so on.

2. Analysis - this is more like the "grammar" of music, or "what makes one particular style different or similar to a different style".

3. Application - this is taking what you know - that "grammar" - and "writing your own story" or "holding a conversation", etc.

If we draw an analogy to language, #1 is like knowing your Alphabet, the letters, the sounds they make (possibly) how words are spelled, what words mean, how to understand speech and speak to others, and also how to read and write words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on.

#2 is more like talking about parts of speech - what a noun is, what a verbs, subject-predicate agreement, and so on.

THIS IS THE DESCRIPTIVE PART when most people are talking about music theory. IOW, you don't have to even know what a noun is to communicate effectively in your native language (well, at least in English we don't). It helps, but just simply growing up in an environment where you do nothing but hear people speak, and you speak, and learn to read and write, you basically "pick up" the grammar of your language (of course, it depends on what you're exposed to...)

So a lot of Music Theory *analysis* is like saying, "oh look, all these people at this time used "Thee", "Thy" and "Thou" commonly, so they all have something in common with each other, and are different from other things that just use "I" or "you", etc. So when we say Music Theory is descriptive, what it means is we're describing (which is revealed through analysis, using the terminology for elements from #1) elements within the story that give it a particular - something - form, relationship to other works, etc. - So we can make a distinction between old English, Elizabethan English, Modern English, and "Text English" and Slang.

_____

Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> essentially describes one aspect that was used commonly throughout one historical period that continues to this day. It's hard to draw an analogy but the nearest I can think of is "Yoda Speak" where "words in wrong order are they". Before Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, which is pre-1600 roughly, was like Yoda Speak. It makes sense, but the "grammer" is not quite the same. And we treat that as a major difference between to major stylistic eras (not unlike the "great vowel shift" in the English language). Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is more like the Grammar that developed the way writers in Victorian England wrote - it's "modern", and not like Shakespeare - and I don't know my authors well enough but if you've ever read HG Wells or Arthur Conan Doyle and things like that, there's a certain way of speaking that is still comprehensible by us, but it's not the way most modern literature is written though most literature (and language) is clearly descended from it, with evolutionary variations. But if we were to make the bold statement that "Victorian Grammer is the epitome of English" then by analogy, "Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" (and Common Practice Period Style) is the epitome of Music.

And unfortunately, many people believe that.

It's not really, but is a significant era, with significant amounts of music, with significant influence, and with relevance today, so it's still super important for most musicians to understand.

________

My #3 - application - that does sort of point at the "composing" aspect in that, if you understand grammar well, you can write a story, poem, or novel.

Probably the best analogy here is a poem. Just by hearing them, one can probably know that they rhyme.

But, if you simply just make things rhyme, while you might have a poem by definition, you might not have any kind of traditional poetic form, and your poem might sound naive - like "they're trying to write a poem but clearly don't know how".

So what we do is name elements and define them (#1) like Rhyme Scheme, Couplet, Consonance, Meter (Iambic Pentameter, etc.), Form (Limerick, Sonnet, etc.) - now, we named these elements from #2 - by analyzing poetry - but what that also allows to do is, then look at other written things (or spoken things) and see if they "meet the definition of poetry" - that is, we are able to "describe" what poetry is, and what makes it poetry, and what those things are, how they're used, and so on in the poem. So we do the exact same thing with music.

Now, Poetry and Music are both art forms. So why we say it's not "prescriptive" is two fold. Firstly, it's not a "rule-based" system. I mean, we AI and stuff that can learn grammatical rules and musical rules and spit out replicas of pieces of art, but really, it's like Legos - sure, if you follow the instructions (rules) you get what's on the picture on the box. But to CREATE your own things from your imagination? Well, you don't "need" the instructions - all you need is a general understanding of how the blocks attach to each other, and maybe inspiration from the world around you, and then you're off and running. So music theory isn't "instructions" in that regard.

The other way it's not prescriptive is that it really is like grammar. I mean, I can say, "sentences must contain a noun and a verb". "Chaos reigned" is a sentence. But "Run milk" might not make all that much sense. Plus like language, sounds don't always have inherent meanings - they can have multiple meanings and meaning depends on context. So "Run milk" could be a command telling your friend nicknamed "milk" a zombie is coming for them. It could also mean to "implement the milk protocol" in a sci-fi movie.

______

Finally, while we may want to exclude extreme fringe examples of sonic art from a definition of "music" that most people want to compose, music can be very very simple, or very very complex. And essentially, the more complex it gets, the more theory you might want to know. You might compose in a completely new and never before heard style, and old theory won't apply. But you may still want to keep some ties to tradition - for example, in both "A Clockwork Orange" and "The Jabberwock" there are a bunch of made up words - but the context still allows you to comprehend them based on your existing knowledge of grammar. So you can use "made up" chords and scales in music, but still present them in more traditional contexts. Or, you can write gibberish where theory doesn't apply. Up to you as an artist.

And, if you want to write in Elizabethan English like Shakespeare, then you need to be intimately acquainted with the grammar of that time. If you want to compose like Bach, you have to know the theory. Now, grammar, or theory is just one aspect of these things - for example grammar has nothing to do with the type of story that would be common in Shake's time - you could, for fun, write a Sci-Fi story using Elizabethan English, but it's not "historically authentic" if that's what you were going for. Likewise, you could play Bach on Synthesizers (Wendy Carlos did). It's not historically authentic, but still fun. But more importantly - like how you learned to speak - you need to immerse yourself in any given musical culture or style. You can't "learn theory" and expect to be able to compose a Symphony if you've never studied any symphonies. Because there's far more to it than just theory.

Many great musicians do everything by ear. They "get" the theory, but they often don't know the terminology - but they "get it" because they live it. This is what everyone else does, so this is what you do. You don't not play blue notes in blues, and you don't play blue notes in classical music. Just like you don't (or shouldn't) cuss out your mama, but it might be ok to let a damn fly with your friends. So theory is a way to describe what is appropriate for given styles and if you want to recreate those styles, then you need to learn the specific "grammar" of that style as well as immerse yourself into it by playing it, and living it, then trying to write it - as composers have always done.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;The /r/musictheory FAQ suggests learning about three seemingly obscure topics as a foundation: counterpoint, partimenti, and post-tonal music. To the uninitiated, those seem far removed from mainstream music.

To the initiated to :-)

Using a word like "partimenti" is a little "too academic" IMHO.

And one of the things that makes me cringe is whenever someone comes on this forum asking about how to write something like modern popular music one of the first responses is always "learn counterpoint" (usually accompanied by 2- upvotes and no additional info).

It is far removed. So much as to be useless in many ways.

Popular music of, let's say, the "Rock and Roll era" (1950s) onward has a lot of ties to tradition - it didn't totally do an about-face. But much of it, being "rebellious", did eschew many of the typical elements of other styles - there's an "anit-functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" movement if you like. That doesn't mean that you can't find songs that aren't purely functional, but certainly, there are plenty that aren't and trying to understand them from a functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> standpoint is trying to put a square peg in a round hole.

Essentially, since you can't really study the non-functional stuff because no really consistent practice has ever developed, you have to study the functional stuff so you can tell where it differs!

I think what you need to understand mainstream pop music of the latter half of the 20th century to the present it:

Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>

Blues

Modes (especially Dorian and Mixolydian)

And to keep in mind that much of the music is not a result of intentional "learned" practices but in many ways would be described academically as "folk", or "primitive" or "naive" and so on - unschooled. Most harmonic practices are situational. Guitar was a predominant instrument so chords and chord progressions tend to focus on what was easy for unschooled players to do on guitar. Something like the common Cadd9 chord doesn't have anything to do with anything other than guitarists finding it easy to do. Obviously, not all music was guitar-based so this is not meant to be an across the board statement, but these kinds of elements have a huge element.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Rhythm looks great!

One reason the repeated note thing in the LH may be troubling you is it more kind of clearly points out some things we could call "errors" in your chords.

Your LH part is kind of like a typical pop progression and we'd kind of expect what's going on to be Dm - Am - C - Dm then repeated.

The problem is, you "main note" of each <b><u>harmony</u></b> tends to imply a different chord.

For example, your first measure we would expect to be Dm, but your long note is a G, which with just a single note (even repeated) in the LH makes it sound like some kind of G chord rather than a Dm chord.

Likewise, the one that would be Am has an F, which makes it sound like some kind of F chord.

Just as an experiment, move all the LH note up a 4th (or down a 5th) so it goes G - D - F - G.

I think you'll hear something more familiar and maybe "better".

It kind of makes it sound like your melody is one key (G) while the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is in another (D). We don't typically do this when writing music like this.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;but flattened the 3rd (F#) to a 2nd (E). 

You "lowered" the 3rd to the 2nd.

&gt;I cannot for the life of me get an answer on quad inversions

That's because there's no such thing! A 4 note chord is a "tetrad" (or rarely, "quartad") but we usually just call them 7th chords in tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Inversions are a Tertian-based thing, so your chord has to have a tertian structure in order to work (aside from our using "inversion" in a rotational sense but that's a different thing).

However, your chord is not inverted.

&gt;Is there even an inversion for this specific chord structure?

Well, there are inversions for 4 note sets (rotations) and even tertian tetrads.

D-F#-A-C as a sus 2 is simply D-E-A-C - now the inversions would work just like they would with the D7 chord, simply replaces the F# in each inversion with the E. But this is likely to create some sounds that won't have the same kind of clear root that the regular 7th would because suspensions originate as *non-chord tones* not chord tones.

However, your chord is a D chord, with D as the lowest note. So it's not inverted at all and the point is moot.

What you may be asking about is "voicing" which is separate from inversions.

In essence, you've taken D-F#-A-C, and voiced it D-A-C-F# and then turned the F# into an E. None of that has changed it out of root position though.

It *could be* a D9, and most people would in fact call it that for simplicity's sake. It's a far more likely way for it to happen in music - the F or F# would be implied or would be in a melody or bass part, or heard from a neighboring chord, etc. That's the reason we don't see D7sus2 as a chord symbol all that often - because it's often more likely a D9 with no 3rd and just a specific voicing of a D9 chord.

One thing that might help you is to look up "Drop 2" and "Drop 4" voicings for guitar. You'll see how a 7th chord across 4 strings in either of those voicings gets inverted. When you use a 9th chord things get trickier though because using only 4 string voicings means one note has to get dropped (as yours could be). Again this makes some of the voicings sound "less rooted" but since these kinds of structures are more often used in Jazz, there's usually an assumed Bass note that implies the D, which allows the guitarist to play voicings that on their own might not sound too D-like, but can easily be used over a D bass context.

Since yours already has the D as the lowest note, it's going to sound pretty solid.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Dyads aren't named.

They are simply seen as "intervals" and are named like that.

C to E is a Major 3rd.

But we don't name them  "C chord name" like we do chords (because, in essence, though some people call them chords, they're not really chords, just intervals).

The only one we have names for are the "Power Chord" which is simply called a "5" chord.

E5, G5, and so on. This is just root and 5th.
______

This is something that a lot of people don't understand: Music Theory is Descriptive, but, it describes actual musical events that took place in quantity.

We don't really have a musical system in existence where only Dyads are used, or where Dyads form the major part of what the system is based on. Thus, not need to "name them as chords". It's the same with Quartal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - there has been no major musical style to develop that uses them as a foundation of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, so no naming system exists for them.

But, as we can see, something like the "power chord" has become some prevalent in a number of musical styles for enough time that giving it a "chord name" is considered appropriate and necessary.

But regular old basic intervals, no not really. That's what notes on the page are for.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Surely, if I use a mode based off the D Major scale, for instance, then it will just end up sounding like D Major due to the nature of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and how our ears are conditioned to look for it?

This is the crux of the problem - our conditioning.

So we have to "thwart" that conditioning.

So what we do is *avoid* functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and avoid anything that either makes the music "drift towards major" or "sound too much like major".

In order to do this, most modal music uses some means other than functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and traditional cadences to "re-focus" our ears on the Final we want it to be rather than whatever the relative Major (or Major Parent) scale is.

Sometimes, the important note or <b><u>harmony</u></b> can be part of a traditional chord progression that when used, distinctively sticks out as "that can't be major" and other times it can just be a progression that avoids common functional progressions (avoiding the vii^o chord for example).

Also, it's important to understand that music "isn't really about <b><u>harmony</u></b>". I mean, it's a big factor, but MELODY also plays a HUGE role here.

So, for example, what makes Dorian different from Minor is note 6.

D Dorian has a B while D minor has a Bb.

So we need to do two things:

1. Keep the tonal center on D instead of C, because obviously D Dorian is the same notes a C Major.

2. Make prominent use of the B note so it's also clear it's not just plain old Dm.

One way to do this is just use a D Drone note with the notes of D Dorian over it. Another way is to use a progression where D becomes the center by "force of will" - hearing it more, used in more important places and so on.

Dm - C - G/B - Dm give you a nice Dorian progression. - Dm - G - Am - Dm is going to do the same. Dm - G - C - Dm might sound a little too much like C Major, but the position of the Dm chord and its predominance means that, in conjunction with melodic phrases that also emphasize D, notes of the D chord (D-F-A) and include this B note prominently, will sound "more Dorian-ish" and "Less C Major-ish".

That's just a simple overview, but that's how most people approach them. Modal Jazz and "Chord Scale Theory" where modes are used on a "per chord" basis rather than "per piece" basis are different animals and there are special considerations for them.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Polychord.

D over Eb.

If you wanted to you could call it Ebmaj7(#9#11) but from a voicing standpoint (even though chord symbols shouldn't be used to imply voicing) D over Eb would be simpler and more elegant.

Write it like a fraction:

D

.....

Eb

&gt;If possible, how would you functionally notate that?

&gt;I feel like the F# is important because it's the leading tone in G minor.

It is, but it doesn't lead to a Gm chord.

&gt;So I feel like acknowledging that D maj triad in the chord is important from an analysis standpoint.

Well, it's a familiar sound no doubt. And that's probably why it was used, and sounds good to us in this context.

But here's the problem: This is not the style of music that those concepts and terminology were developed for. It's no necessarily tonal music, and it's not necessarily functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and using those terms and concepts to describe it is uninformative. It's simply two common sounds from Gm used together.

Where is it borrowed from?

20th century classical music? Jazz?  It was inspired by other composers who use polychords in their music. It comes from there, not some other key or mode or whatever.

The "logic" in useing them is because of the really cool colors they create. That's art.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Why do you want to be abnormal?

Why do you need new progessions?

Billions of artists and composers seem happy to make billions of dollars off of the same old progressions.

Here, something unusual:

I I I I I I I I I I I I

How many 1 chord songs do you know? If you're looking for a challenge, try restricting yourself to fewer element so you can concentrate on creativity.

"adding more chords" does not make it better. Adding in unusual chords does not make you more creative.

I - iii - vi - ii - V - I is by far NOT the most common thing to do.

I can't think of any songs right now that use that progression.

But I can think of probably 20 that use the "Axis Progression" and probably 50 that are 12 bar blues off the top of my head.

You're already creating an "unusual" and "different" progression by using a progression that's not commonplace. I don't know why you think it is , but it's not.

Try writing just a melody.

Try using a static <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Try oscillating between only two harmonies, or three.

It seems that if you think that progression is most common then you haven't really learned (or analyzed) any music at all. Maybe you should spend more time learning music by others and seeing how they deal with it that worrying about whether a progression is "normal" or not. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>u/billybrowntrombone, trying to cut through the noise here :-)

So, Classical Music - which is likely what you're studying in Theory, is different from a lot of other styles. There are many styles that are either descending from this "CPP" music (Common Practice Period) and certainly some of those elements are still in use in many styles and may even be prevalent.

But, to explain maybe a little more deeply:

The progression "up a 4th" or "Root Movement of a 4th" is considered the strongest Functional progression because it allows the Dominant to resolve to the Tonic. It also very quickly helps us establish keys because it makes unique progressions that can't be duplicated in other keys, so things like ii - V, and vi - ii also exhibit this property.

However, maybe a better way to say it (and the way it is often said) is to refer to those functions - Tonic, Dominant, and Subdominant (or Pre-Dominant, or Dominant Prep, etc.) and then authors don't agree on the others, but one word is "Mediant" or another is "Variable".

What CPP music does is use Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> to imply and establish a Tonal Center (Key) through use of SD to D to T progressions. This could be ii - V - I (and frequently is).

ii could be replaced by IV, and V could be replaced by vii^o (and notice IV to vii^o is also root movement of a 4th).

But, IV - V - I also does well to establish tonality and is functional - being SD-D-T, but one of them is not a 4ths progression.

Secondary Dominant chords are actually also the same as a V(7) - I resolution, and thus a 4ths progression too. But, Secondary Leading Tone chords can be (and often are) used similarly.

N6 goes to V - which some people see N as a modified II, but others see it as a special type of chord.

So we could say that the Cycle of 4ths progressions are part of the structural underpinning of Functional Progression and Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, but, in that they exhibit the SD-D-T functional progression, not "Just" that they're a 4th apart (because as we can see, there are other possible moves with similar function).

iii is actually a very rare chord in Major keys. If you were to tally up the number of chords in every piece during the CPP, you'd probably see I, or maybe even V(7) at the top of the list. ii and maybe IV, then vi and vii^o are probably next. iii would be way down on the list. In fact, you'll probably see more Neapolitans and way more Secondary chords before you see a iii! In fact, you're probably even more likely to modulate to a new key and use a bunch of non-iii chords in that key before you'll see a iii in the primary key !!!

I have my book of Bach Chorales here and the progression for the first one goes:

I - I - IV - V - I - I - V - vi - IV - vii^o - I - V

So, my point to you in my original response is, look at this. It's not your typical pop music - I - V - vi - IV progression. There's one in there, but it's not a 4 chord loop like so much pop music. It's not just slamming a 7th, 9th, or alteration on there to make it "more interesting" or "more unique" and so on. It doesn't even have any significant Cycle progressions - IV to vii^o is one. So is V to I. I to IV is not usually considered one because I is treated specially, but it's not a iii going to vi, and a vi going to ii and so on.

Where the "interest" comes in - and this is part of my original point - is which chords are used when and how they work with the melody, and which chords are inverted (for example the first IV and V are which is different from root position) and so on.

So it's more about making the <b><u>harmony</u></b> serve the melody, and in doing so, creating interest and variety through inversion and chord choice (also, in Chorale, there's the addition of non-chord tones, though rhythm is pretty straightforward in that style).

But, there is also a general move and smaller moves from SD-D-T.

T - T - **SD - D - T** - T - *D - fake tonic* - **SD - D - T** and this ends on a half cadence to set up the next phrase.

There are types of analysis which also reduce phrases like this to show a more basic structure, where the first part is all sort of an elaboration of the Tonic function (the IV and V being weak because they're inverted) and the "real" move being IV - vii^o - I and so on (I'm not saying that's exactly what it is here, but that's how it often works) which is a "deeper level - SD - D - T move.

So actually, that kind of analysis is used in "more complex" pieces that don't follow the more obvious path or where function is more obscured. But generally, we like to talk about it in terms of function rather than specific chord numerals all the time.
____

Now, popular music is different and is even more likely to not only not use any Cycle of 4ths progressions, but not use functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> either - some are "anti-functional" on purpose, or do what we call a "retrogression", which is going "backwards" - DOWN a 4th instead of up a 4th! So it's like going - T - D - SD - T for your pieces - the wrong way! But we accept it because we like the way it sounds too.

_____


I keep saying "4ths" and "Cycle" because really, the "Circle of 5ths" isn't at all about progressions. It's about Keys. Period. But obviously because it's organized in 5ths many people make the connection. I prefer "Cycle of 4ths" or just "Root Movement of a 4th" because it ties in with what you use for voice-leading principles and so on. But some people don't care to make such a distinction.

____

And finally, I was just trying intentionally throw you some curveballs to get you to think about this stuff - too bad others reacted so counter, but it's a very common problem we see - people trying to make chord progressions "more hip" or "more complex" and so on. There can certainly be reasons to do so, but if you think about it, a common Jazz misconception is to just put say an alteration or higher extension on the chords. But the problem is, that becomes a cliche itself and then isn't really any more complex.

It's more about what chord you use when - or when you don't. Sometimes a well placed triad in the middle of some 7th chords, or a well placed secondary in the middle of a diatonic progression, can say far more than just making a string of secondaries (in a "circle of 5ths progression"!) That's fine in a sequence on as part of a development section or something, but it can seem over-bearing and tend to wander or have *too much** direction/thrust in a phrase - sometimes, composers just want it to be all about I, or all about I and V, and so on.

So don't get too caught up in always trying to make the progression the main focus of a piece. It's OK for it to be "boring" if your melody makes up for it. It's even better to learn to use inversions creatively (which most pop music doesn't even touch on).

These are the kinds of things you're likely studying in theory class - but sometimes it's a little hard to see the forest for the trees. So take a step back, look at the forest, the trees, the leaves, the limbs, the roots, and everything because music is really about the big picture and overall effect of the piece - sometimes it could be a forest, but sometimes it could just be a single giant old oak tree in a pasture that's so beautiful on its own.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; The book emphasises that the 1, 3 and 5 scale degrees of the major scale are the tension relieving notes of the melody(the tonic the most). What does it have to do with passing notes? 

Nothing.

&gt;If we have a melody in D major but key of C, will a D E D be a tension relieving melody? 

Er... you've made a typo I think.

The melody could be in D Major. Did you mean "Chord"?

A C chord is not in the key of D Major, so it's not the best example.

In the melodic pattern D-E-D, E would be a Neighbor Tone if the chord was D, or a D chord moving to G, etc.  - i.e. the D note would be a Chord tone, and the E would not.

"tension relieving" has nothing to do with this really.

I think what the book is saying (or should be saying) is that 1, 3, and 5 are considered the "tonal degrees" of a Key and are also considered "stable" tones and tones of resolution as far as the KEY is concerned. Likewise, scale degrees 2, 4, 6, and 7 are called "Tendency Tones" because their *general* tendency *in reference to the key* is to resolve to the tonal degrees (sometimes people also called scale degrees 2, 4, 6, and 7, "modal degrees"). Therefore, scale degree 4 has a tendency to resolve down to scale degree 3.

However, CHORDS over-ride these tendencies.

Scale degree 4, a G in the key of G Major, may move anyway it pleases most of the time, if the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is for example a I chord - D Major.

So G could be a neighbor to F# or A, or it could be a passing tone between F# and A either direction.

There's no real "resolution" there, even if it moves from 4 to 3. It only usually has a sense of "relieving tension" when it's in a harmonic context where it's a dissonance (but could be a chord tone!) resolving to a consonance. For example, in A7 to D, the G note (scale degree 4) resolves down to F# (3). This is not any type of Non Chord Tone. It may look and even act like an IN, or App. or PT or NT based on where it comes from, but in that case the Harmonic Tendecy of Dissonance resolving to Consonance over-rides any other tendency. In this example though it happens to agree with the "key tendency" but it doesn't always have to. And that has nothing to do with PT or NT, etc.

Sorry to see this got downvoted.

As chordspace has shown, you're kind of "on to something".

There are some pretty obvious things in a lot of music - if you look at Gregorian Chant, it's mainly stepwise, with leaps that aren't too large (the larger the leap the rarer it is) and things we see as "outlining a chord" didn't happen in the same way we see it later.

When we get to CPP music, especially the Classical Period, you see an abundance of "chordal" melodies - melodies that outline the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. There's still all of the stuff from way back, but there's way more "arpeggiated melodies". Also, as time goes on, larger intervals appear, and larger intervals continuing in the same direction become more common.

As we get to the 20th century, you start seeing more "angular" melodies, with larger leaps and of course non-diatonic scales and more dissonant intervals.

I'm not really up on AI or computer algorithms, but my understanding is this how you can create predictive models - you feed in a style or even an individual composer's style and catalog it this way - or like, "what is the probability a C in the key of C will be followed by an E, or F#, or Bb..." and so on.

One of the psychological aspects of this seems to be that melodies with larger leaps are harder to follow, especially when there's other accompaniment going on.

Look up "compound melody". Once notes are registrally displaced, we can't follow a line as easily and more likely to hear it as two separate elements.

BTW, we use the words "consecutive intervals" to mean something else.

I don't know of a specific term for what you're describing, but "successive" would probably be a better term.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In the chorus?

It's Gm - Eb - Bb - F.

The classic "Axis" 4 chord progression.

The Dm chord is questionable - it can hear what might be considered an F6 (which is a D note added to an F chord). I didn't listen to it super intently or on really great speakers and sometimes stuff like that is F one time then Dm the next and so on. But I'm hearing just a basic F chord - the melody goes Bb - C over it and doesn't even hit any D worth mentioning.

You know, I know people like this style of music but it's really horrible for learning to transcribe. It's got so much processing, so much reverb and delay, so much filtering and eq - so many synth sounds that are "atmospheric" and so on.

You need something with more prominent Bass notes and chordal notes, not all this froo froo "airy" kind of sounding synth parts!

Also a lot of modern pop music (even from before this style) is "pandiatonic" meaning there are often so many notes happening in so many different instruments that they can sound "right" even if you're playing a chord they don't belong to.

For example, whether the last chord here is F or Dm, the melody is a Bb - that's an "allowable" non-chord tone even from traditional standpoint (well assuming it's an F chord) but in pop music you get that stuff in the bass part, and in any countermelodies, harmonic embellishments, arp synths, and so on, that it just becomes this mass of "notes in the key" and they all sort of all sound OK with each other. Which again is part of what makes it hard to hear things in this kind of context. It also means you can't say "the melody note is Bb, so it must be a Gm, Bb, or Eb chord - because it could be F, Dm, Am, or something else as well. So you can't use that as easily as a means of eliminating choices - though in other styles it would be a go to technique.

Then the production on top of that just adds to the confusion as you get echoed notes from a chord a beat before still being heard in ambience over a different chord.

Usually, aside from Melody, your Bass line is the best indicator - much popular music only uses chords in root position so if you can pick out the bass (which is why prominent bass notes are helpful) it can tell you the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

I grew up on pop-rock where bass players often just simply played the root note in 8th notes so it kind of beats you over the head with it. The guitars often just play a chord version of the same notes - power chords - so you can figure them out pretty easily - makes for an easy transition from basic melodies into harmonies.

Try a song like this where the bass is singled out and pretty prominent:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acK0KH2uJGc

I grew up on songs like this, where the chord progression is laid pretty bare:

Songs like this, are even better, because not much else is going on:

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't know that composers actually used the chords this way.

The whole point in many cases is that in cyclical progressions, there is no function - IOW, in the absence of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, what holds the progression together is the cyclical nature of the pattern. It's not unlike Sequential Progressions (which they're really part of) where the "logic" is in the sequence itself, rather than any functional hierarchy.

Can you give any examples of where a III or bIII, would be a "Dominant Function" chord?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, that's interesting, but I don't think by any means universal.

The problem is that cycles of 3rds, and ultimately 2nds are really part and parcel of non-functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, so assigning them function is really quite arbitrary and potentially misleading.

He might be saying they are "like" those functions or "could be used as" those functions by a composer, but it's not really functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> anymore.

There are a couple of problems with this kind of approach, firstly that it should be 4ths, not 5ths.

G UP to C, or V UP to I would be your functional progression.

Thus it should be, for example bVII UP to I or Bb to C that is a "similar" function (in fact, vii^o to I already is!).

There are probably far more bVI - bVII - i progressions that are treated as cadences in actual music than there are iii - ii - I or any other similar qualities. And that agrees.

These are all "ideas for composing", not anything that actually happened commonly in music - that is, taking traditional elements and applying them to non-traditional harmonies.

I wouldn't put too much into this chart. It's fine for larger conceptual ideas, but things as specific as "iii takes on the Dominant Function in a cycle of thirds progression" is not really borne out in the musical community at large.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, yes and no :-)

There are a couple of different things going on here, and a major one is how Consonance and Dissonance is treated in music.

And this varies from historical period to historical period and from style to style, but as a broad general observation, things that were once dissonant have become consonant over time, or, at least *treated like* consonances.

Tertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> (building chords in 3rds) is actually not the first way to build harmonies, and "consonance based" <b><u>harmony</u></b> is slightly different from "tertian based" <b><u>harmony</u></b> in practice.

Harmonically speaking, 3rds, 6ths, and 5ths are all consonances. 4ths were, then went to being consonances only in certain contexts, and then back to consonant again.

2nds and 7ths were dissonant pretty consistently up to the 20th century.

But - and here's where things get tricky - and what you've basically stumbled upon - once we get to "chords" as we know them (tertian based triads, etc.) those notes that are dissonances may still be **dissonant** but *achieve chord tone status*!

IOW, there's a subtle distinction between being a chord tone, and being an out and out dissonance. And basically, this is how <b><u>harmony</u></b> has generally evolved - notes that were at first dissonances and simply not use, became usable dissonances, then became chord tones (but still dissonant) then became what are essentially consonances.

Roundabout Beethoven's time, the 7th was a chord tone, but still a dissonance and treated like so, and 9ths were just started to get added commonly as "the next extension" - still a dissonance, but starting to get treated more like the 7th.

By the time we get to the 20th century and late 1800s, you're seeing composers add higher and higher extensions - 11ths and 13th and treating them like "stand alone chords" without any need to resolve.

Then you get to the point where people are writing things like parallel 2nds or 7ths, and more dissonant structures where for all intents and purposes, any note is a "chord tone".

Now, most people talking about 13th chords and what not are coming from a Jazz background and while the evolution is different there, the "basic unit" of Jazz <b><u>Harmony</u></b> might be seen as a "consonant 7th chord" where it doesn't have to resolve - and by extension, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths are treated the same way - it's why we can have Cmaj7, C6, C6/9, C7(13) all as tonic chords for example.

It's an "acceptance" of more dissonant notes/extensions as "stable" or IOW "treated like consonances".

So yes, in effect, in certain contexts you could "harmonize" any note with any interval, however, most people in certain styles have a specific approach for this, such as using traditional tertian-based voicings. There's also a tendency in Jazz to "justify" things simply by naming them, such that, if you can come up with a chord symbol for it, it must be OK!

So to give an example, it's common with French composers at the turn of the century to use "planing" or parallel chords and one of their favorites was the Dominant 9th chord (like C9) - Debussy, and Ravel especially liked these kinds of sounds.

In jazz people call this "constant structure <b><u>harmony</u></b>" or similar terms but the thing is, playing the *interval* of a 9th in parallel along with a melody line might not sound quite as legitimate as playing 9th chords with that 9th on top.

And this is because we're putting it in a *harmonic* context where the 9th is an acceptable *psuedo consonance* versus the plain interval where it's simply an *interval* - which doesn't carry the harmonic implication with it. That doesn't mean it won't sound good or bad but the point is, writers just don't choose their <b><u>harmony</u></b> or harmonizations willy nilly - they do it based on an understanding of the style they're working in.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>That's a really open ended idea though...

I mean I "compose" so I'm a "composer" - I don't do it professionally or as my only or primary source of income, but I do write pieces every once in a while.

So what it even means to be a "composer" is kind of ill-defined, plus most compose in many styles and do a lot of different things - so hard to class them as distinct from "everyone else" really.

I don't think 2nds are "consonant" but I also don't have a problem with secundal <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I actually don't think any interval is consonant or dissonant because I know from experience that it's how they're *treated* in a piece of music that makes the difference. There might be a difference in that kind of conceptualization than "everyone else" but I don't know that I'm not unique in this thinking, or it's standard fare for anyone...

I'm ok with The Pixies too :-)

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Consider the repeated notes simply "re-iterations" and you have a quarter, quarter, quarter in the measure that looks like I - I - vii^o6

But now you're thinking of the repeated 8ths as just a single quarter on beat 3 you can see how they're non-chord tones.

The Eb is a lower neighbor (resolving to the F in the treble), the Bb a passing tone moving to A, and the G moving to A.

So it's not really a chord at all - just a collection of simultaneous non chord tones that happen to spell a familiar chord.

But as Vornska said, it's not "really" a chord at all. It's all just an F <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, with some non chord tones on beat 3 (that happen to spell a known chord).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is not how music of the Common Practice Period is analyzed in academic circles.

Non-Chord Tones are a pretty important part of Polyphonic Counterpoint and the axiom here would be "just because something looks like a chord doesn't mean it's a chord".

This has to do with conceptual aspects like Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, Voice-Leading, and harmonic practices within contrapuntal frameworks.

To kind of simply explain it:

G - G - G

E - F - E

C - C - C

We don't call the middle chord "Csus4". It's simply not a chord. It's a "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" where one note has been displaced by a Non Chord Tone.

Likewise:

G - A - G

E - E - E

C - C - C

Looks even more like a "named chord" because now it's not even a "sus" kind of thing, but a standard triad.

But, conceptually, if the function is that of a Tonic triad for example, the A is simply a "decorative" tone - a Neighbor Tone. So it's "not really" an Am/C chord, but a "C <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" with a NCT.

When you couple the two together:

G - A - G

E - F - E

C - C - C

You get something that looks like C - F/C - C - but again, the F chord is really more "decorative" and is "resultant" from contrapuntal motion - NCTs, rather than being a "real" chord.

Some theorists call chords like this "apparent" chords, and others do things like put a IV6/4 in parentheses to show, yes, it spells a IV6/4, but it has a weak harmonic function. Again, it's just decorative, not "functionally" or "harmonically" important.

This is actually kind of borne out in situations where such motion results in "chords" that *aren't* nameable.

For example, you may run into a situation like the following:

G - Ab - G

E - E - E

C - Bb - C

So while the middle chord could spell a Bb7#5, we don't even have those kinds of chords in CPP <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It's more clearly a *result* of upper and lower neighbor motion in the outer parts. In four voices, you could even end up with wackier things that are like clusters, or quartal chords and so on. While we can always find some name for them using "jazz" thinking, this ain't jazz and simply naming this simultaneity as a chord totally negates the importance of the linear melodic motion in each contrapuntal part.

So when a chord like the one in the example given (a CPP work) appears in a context like this (which at this time period was pretty reliant on polyphonic counterpoint still) we like to make the distinction between a "true stand alone <b><u>harmony</u></b>" and one that is merely "resultant" of Non Chord Tone linear/melodic motion.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, it's hard to say.

If you're the typical pop style guitar player, I would say really it's probably more important to learn to play the music of others, and begin writing your own music if you aren't already doing that in earnest.

Theory is really not very useful unless you're applying it in daily use!

You don't specify two of the sort of "next step" aspects which are Secondary chords and Mode Mixture. If you don't know that stuff, that is the logical path.

In universities, Semester 1 is "fundamentals" but it moves quickly into Analysis, Part-Writing, Figured Bass Realization, Formal considerations (Cadences, Phrases, Periods, Forms, etc.).

Most of that stuff would probably not be of too much interest to a person with a pop background, and even Jazz players are probably not really too interested in it (their time is better spent realizing Lead Sheets rather than Figured Bass for example, and learning 12 Bar and Song forms rather than Binary and Ternary forms, etc.)

So it really depends on where you're coming from and where you want to go with it.

You don't mention 7th chords, and those are the next most important things after triads of course. But then it's really Chromatic <b><u>Harmony</u></b> - which includes the Secondary and Borrowed chords - which is more relevant to all styles.

Beyond that, most things are either genre specific, or "too classical" to be of use to someone interested in other fields.

For example, I'm not sure an in-depth study of Sonata Form is going to be all that useful for you - though of course knowing it and choosing not to use it is a whole lot different than not knowing it and wanting to use it! So any knowledge is good of course - but a lot of that kind of stuff may not be *necessary* and the performance aspects (or instrument skills) are of far more use.

Do you know your 7th chords?

Do you know how Secondary chords work? Borrowed chords?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Lead sheets don't indicate function.

If you want to add it I suppose you could, but I don't know why you would because it's superfluous information. D for Dominant, T for Tonic, SD for Subdominant - that's the typical Jazz way of abbreviating those functions.

But most people simply understand that V means "dominant".

Lead sheets are meant to play music from and give you only the information you need to do so - the melody, and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> (aside obviously from things like feel, key, etc.). No need to fussy up the score with unnecessary info.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No such thing as "sus11".  They are sus4.

You have to look at IMPLIED <b><u>harmony</u></b> when you're playing dyads.

Gaug is the only chord that's not in a key. Though is it really G+ or is it a G and Eb?

G5 = G-D

G+ = G-B-D#, but you could actually have G=Eb

Gsus4 = G-C-D

Fno5 = F-A

Fsus4 = F-Bb-C

F5 = F-C

so you've got the notes:

G A Bb (B) C D (D#) Eb F G

Assuming your G+ is actually a G/Eb dyad, then you're pretty securely in **G Minor**.

If it's truly G+ that complicates matters.

</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Well, not bad for a first attempt.

There are a couple of things to think about - you're composing for Guitar, Bass, and Drums as if they were Flute, Clarinet, and Bassoon - that's kind of odd.

That's not to say it can't be done - it surely can be - but that's not what most people would do for this type of ensemble. Usually drums would carry a rhythm pattern (a "drum beat") and bass would play foundation notes and lines for the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and guitar would carry the <b><u>harmony</u></b> or possibly a melody (or both).

What kind of music are you modelling this on? 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Generally speaking, the way composers of tonal music do it is that melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> are conceived of together. IOW, once they start noodling with a melody, they know what Key it's in, and what kind of potential harmonies could accompany it and so on.

Then what they do is decide what kind of texture to set the melody in - contrapuntal - where it's more linear - additional lines (counter melodies) or homophonic - where it's more vertical (melody with chordal accompaniment).

A melody could be accompanied by an infinite number of ideas, so there's no correct answer here. Think of it like a character in a setting. "Bob" is "at his office" or "driving down the freeway" or "fishing for the weekend" - each setting would be different, but the character is still recognizably the same.

Maybe he's an "office drone" and the accompaniment there would simply be low long notes that don't do much. Then in traffic, maybe it's fast paced - other cars zipping by, bobbing and weaving through lane changes and exists - you might see this as counterpoint - with multiple countermelodies zipping along. Then fishing by the brook - might be sort of a combination of the two - harmonies created by countermelodies that themselves aren't attention getting, but together form a nice harmonic backdrop like undulating water.

So you figure out the "general <b><u>harmony</u></b>" and then add ideas to support that - but, as you compose, you shouldn't lock yourself into just one option.

In fact, one of the best things you can do for yourself is to take "Bob" and put him in a bunch of different settings - take your melody and harmonize it a number of ways and in a number of textures - because often in music "characters" re-appear throughout a composition in different attire, in different settings, with different emotions, and so on.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In older music (Classical Music) 9th chords were used primarily as dissonant chords that resolved like 7th chords, with the 9th resolving down into the next <b><u>harmony</u></b>. By and large they happen on Dominant 9th chords.

It's not until we get more towards the end of the Romantic Period and into Impressionism that you start seeing both Minor and Major 9th chords and freer treatment of Dominant 9th chords.

In most cases, they would be used simply as extensions of a chord and just go along with the chord to where the chord would go.

If it was Dm7 - to G7, it would be Dm9 - G9.

However, the freer used of the Dominant 9th especially got coupled with the ideas of a "color" chord (used just for its own sound) and in "planing" sequences (9th chords moving in parallel).

Interestingly, the Dom9th especially is part and parcel of Funk music, and we guitar players often treat it as a triad on the upper 3 strings, as in D-F#-B over top of an E <b><u>harmony</u></b> which we then slide up a whole step to E-G#-C# giving us a 13th chord (assuming the 7th implied in another instrument). What's cool about it is you get this kind of melodic chordal movement within an over-riding <b><u>harmony</u></b> at the same time.

But there are also plenty of Funk lines with parallel moving 9th chords (again usually dominant 9th though).

FWIW, another common guitar player trick is add9 chords, which are more likely to happen over a Major or minor chord - Hendrix loved them.

Of course you can look to Jazz where 9ths can be added at will to chords :-)

Finally, another way to look at them is as the result of melodic movement - for example, you might have Am7 with an A on top, but then move that up melodically to B (and maybe to C, then back) and get a m9 chord that way.

Fmaj13(#11)

_____

Ok so let's clear up a couple of things.

Firstly, chord names are just "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" names, not **specific**.

A chord with "13" in the name doesn't and really isn't intended to tell you if the 9th and/or 11th is included.

Secondly, when a 7th is present, it's 9, 11, or 13, and when the 7th is not present, it's "add9" "add11" and so on.

Thirdly we don't usually use "add2" or "add4" (though some pop sources do) and instead call them "add9" etc. even if the added note is low in the chord.

Finally, naming chords is kind of a stupid exercise :-)

If you want people to play specific voicings, you need to write it out as standard notation, or for guitar, tablature or chord diagrams. Chord Symbols (names) are not intended for this.

Think about it this way, if I put "C", a player could play that any number of ways. Same with G13(#11) - they could play it a number of ways. It's totally up to them - just because it has more notes or "numbers" in the chord name doesn't mean you get to specify any more :-)

So there's no way to name some of these that a guitarist would play them that way. You have to notate it, or tab it out, etc. There's no point in even naming the chords aside from maybe telling people who can't read tab what they are (which is why guitarists need to learn to read standard notation) or as just a practice exercise for you to learn how to do it.

So what this means and why I spelled it out like I did above, you can't really put "add9add11add13"!

You can get away with stuff like "add9(#11)" because putting the #11 means to include it - but because it's altered. But if it were plain 11 it would probably be "add9add11" which again gets cumbersome.

One way around this is to look for alternate bass names so for example your 7th to last chord could simply be C/F. It's much more compact than Fmaj7sus2.

Hopefully you can see that the system is just not designed to name these rather complex non-tertian "added note" style chords. It can, but it produces rather cumbersome names that really don't mean any more than "Am7", which again, could be played any number of ways.

____

You're not doing it wrong at all and this is actually very typical guitar playing - including open strings within other chord shapes to create harmonically rich chords that give us weird names.

And your naming for the most part is good. Your errors with the tougher ones stem more from the difference between 2, 4, and 6, and 9, 11, and 13 and just some typos.

So really good job!

But, please do yourself a lifelong favor and learn to use standard music notation if you don't already know how to do so - and while published music would certainly name the chords in a standard notation with tab with chord diagrams format, don't try to worry about voicings with the names - just use them as a general reference - an "after the fact name" that is the "one that is clearest" without using it to play from or anything like that.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's really hard to say without being able to directly assess your skills.

It might be more helpful for you at this point to post compositions and get critiques on them - even if just exercises and so on.

Really, the go to is going to be the music of other composers, and trying to emulate that. All the "Theory Texts" all just sort of do roughly the same thing - they may take varied approaches but the information is pretty standard. They're more a "what is mode mixture" than "how you as a composer can use mode mixture" because aside from one or two examples they may give, the examples again are in real music and analyzing it.

Rhythm is a far tougher subject - most musicians - even some excellent ones, are weakest in rhythm (except trained percussionists). But with composing it depends on where you are - and again that requires assessment - I mean, are you writing music with only quarters and 8ths, or are you into metric modulation and hyper complex rhythms? And sometimes, all a piece requires is a simple rhythm...(same could be said of <b><u>harmony</u></b> as well).

So again it's really hard to tell without seeing some of your music and seeing where you are with it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Parallel means when two voices/parts move the same direction by the same amount.

It could also mean when an interval played on a single chordal instrument does the same.

If a Soprano singer sings an E, then moves down to D, and an Alto singer sings an A below the E, and then moves at the same time down to G so you get the following:

E - D

A - G

You have an example of Parallel 5ths.

In this case, the distance between A and E is a PERFECT 5th and so is G to D so we may sometimes say "Parallel Perfect 5ths" but the word "Parallel" implies they would both be the same type of interval (Perfect 5ths in this case).

"Parallel" motion also implies SIMILAR direction, so this:

E - E

A - A

is not considered "Parallel" because there's no "motion" at all - it just repeats.

But, if both notes go up, or down, by the same amount, then the distance between them will also remain the same, so it's both Similar motion (they're both going up, or both going down) and because it's the same amount, it's more specifically Parallel motion.
_________

There is nothing wrong with Parallel 5ths. However in some styles they were not used. If you were trying to emulate such a style authentically you would also want to avoid Parallel 5ths. 

However, there are many styles that embrace them - Parallel Organum from the Middle Ages, Planing in Impressionism (Debussy and composers like that) and they are part and parcel of Modern Electric Guitar technique and ubiquitous in pop music and especially hard rock/metal guitar where entire progressions are made up of Parallel Perfect 5ths (Power Chords).

_____

Other intervals can be parallel as well, and the word is sometimes kind of loosely used - for example, we'll often say "parallel 6ths" or "parallel 3rds" which really should be called "consecutive" intervals in similar motion as "parallel" implies it would be MAJOR 3rd to MAJOR 3rd specifically - but when you play 3 or more 3rds or 6ths in similar motion in a song in a key for example, you'll usually get a mixture of major and minor 3rds and 6ths - so while they may not technically be parallel, we still use the word.

The prohibition against Parallel 5ths is largely part of Counterpoint arising in the Renaissance Period and then continues into the Common Practice Period which includes the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic Periods.

In Counterpoint, the main idea is for each part or voice (like the melody each singer would sing) would harmonize together but more importantly, maintain a sense of individuality - one way to do that was to move voices "counter" to each other - contrary motion. But constant contrary motion gets boring (and is impossible in 3 or more parts) so similar motion was allowed, but under more strict guidlines - because when voices move in similar, their independence is weakened - it sounds like one voice is "following along" with the other, or becoming dependent on it. If they move in consecutive motion, it's even more so, and when they move in Parallel motion, so much so that they totally lose their independence. Parallel 8ves are especially bad because it sounds like one part just drops out and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> goes away and so on. Parallel 5ths are not much better - they remain a little more harmonic but still stick out like a sore thumb and don't sound very contrapuntal. There was no prohibition against 3rds or 6ths because again, even when consecutive they don't usually stay parallel more than a couple of moves so they don't lesson the <b><u>harmony</u></b> or independence as much.

So during the time period mentioned above, composers didn't use Parallel Perfect 5ths (or 8ves) between any pair of parts/voices (or when something similar happened on a chordal instrument) in Contrapuntal textures (4-Part Chorale style writing for example) so if you want to write in that style, you shouldn't use them either!

But, if you're playing modern pop music, there's nothing wrong with them. If you're playing metal, you BETTER use them!!!!

______

And just to be clear, Parallel motion happens between a PAIR of parts/voices - the vertical (harmonic) interval of a 5th say between a Flute and Oboe, or an Alto and Tenor, or between two Violins playing in counterpoint, or the melody and bass line on a keyboard instrument, moving to another 5th distributed the same way.

It has nothing to do with a note in a melody, moving to the next note in a melody - that's just called a melodic interval and moving from an A note up 5th to an E note is NOT parallel 5ths - just a melodic interval of a 5th.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; interval of a perfect fifth is so 'encompassing' as to obscure the other? That's the thought that formed in my mind. 

Maybe a better way to put it is one note is "subsumed" into the other. But yeah, you have the right idea.

&gt;If a piano player plays Amin9 you wouldn't want one guitarist to play A-E and another to play E-B. 

Well the piano player has nothing to do with it.

If one guitar plays A up to E, and the other plays E up to B above that, then yes, that would Parallel 5ths.

However, when you start talking about the Am9 chord - if that <b><u>harmony</u></b> sounded the whole time it would be just seen as arpeggiating chord tones - parallel 5ths usually assume a "change in <b><u>harmony</u></b>" - so if it went from Am9 to E7 and the guitars move that way, then parallel 5ths. But within the same <b><u>harmony</u></b>, usually there's a little grace there.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Wow, Ok. Cool.

So, steel drums are pitched, but being a metallic instrument, they contain a lot of inharmonic overtones, And since you generally play one part (or 2 note chords) in a full ensemble, it's similar to being say an Oboe player in a woodwind quartet - where you don't play <b><u>harmony</u></b> yourself a lot, but the whole group does.

I noticed in theory classes people who didn't play chordal instruments had a harder time grasping <b><u>harmony</u></b> - in fact sometimes I'd think a student actually thought that the whole orchestra was just playing the same thing they were - not playing different notes!

So part of this could be your used to concentrating primarily on your part, not not really "hearing" or "listening to" or "paying attention to" how your part incorporates with the others, and another part could just be that the pans have made you used to hearing things one way, which a lot of other instruments don't necessarily do - so it could have made you listen for the wrong thing.

Since you play guitar though - and that's primarily chordal - I would suggest just sitting down and learning chords and learning songs. You should be able to sit down and play an A chord then an Am chord, and start just listening to the difference between those two. Then to it with D and Dm, E and Em and so on. Then start working on augmented and diminished chords, then on to 7th chords.

Playing them on a chordal instrument will really help.

Also, singing along with a chord, and then doing things like playing a C chord on guitar, but adding a 7th with your voice really helps you "intuit" and internalize what that 7th sounds like  - so when you hear it somewhere else you go "ah, that must be adding a 7th to the chord".

Since you're playing on the fly, I understand you wanting to build this ability - and of course trial by fire is a sure way to learn, but it can be frustrating.

Your comment below of never putting in the effort is the problem though.

It also helps to have some knowledge of theory so you can use process of elimination.

For example, if you had a basic reggae song, many of them are just in a basic key, and use I, IV, V, and maybe vi. So you ask the key - if the key is A, then it's A, D, and E (7) and maybe F#m.

If you don't know your chords to your keys, that's something that's really going to help narrow down possible choices - so your ear might tell you "minor", and then your theory knowledge will tell you "must be F#m, or maybe C#m or Bm, since those are the only minor chords in the key of A.


The song you linked to is quite a bit more tricky because it's so busy.

But you know, go online and see if you can find chords for those songs! My ear is pretty good and I do a lot of what you're talking about (in different styles) but if I listen to a song and it's got more than a couple of changes, I will totally "cheat" and find a YT video or a chord chart for it online!

Now obviously, if a song is called on the fly and I've never heard it and no one can tell me the key, I'll just try to pick out a few notes here or there and just keep it simple until I get far enough into the song I can figure out what's going on!!!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I see why this has been downvoted. I won't.

But, u/Conrad59 the traditional approach is to write a melody first then harmonize it - "harmonize a melody" rather than "melodize a <b><u>harmony</u></b>".

However, u/bj14231 it is true that a lot of people writing non-traditional music do in fact start with the chord progression first and write a melody to it as Conrad59 suggests.

But really, what you need is an understanding of how melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> work together in music, and conceive of both kind of at the same time - so you don't come up with a melody with no idea of key. You come up with a melody where you already understand the possible harmonic implications.

And that comes from playing lots of music and analyzing it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; Sources for this claim?

All of the first Polyphony, where an existing Chant melody was used and <b><u>harmony</u></b> was added to it. That practice continued from about the 1100s through the Baroque period where you see Bach doing the same thing - taking a chant melody and harmonizing it. In fact, there are multiple chorales that use the same melody that are harmonized differently. The same is true for classical Theme and Variations movements, which begin with the theme borrowed from another composer, which is then harmonized and elaborated. That continues well into the 20th century. It's even pretty clear in atonal music that a diatonic melody is composed and a chromatic accompaniment is placed under it, and in dodecaphony the tone row can also be seen as a "melody" that is created first.

Any form of imitative polyphony, especially things like Canons, have to start with the melody first.

Even Jazz uses "reharmonizations" and substitutions taking a given melody that was written first and creating new changes for it.

However, you're right (and I said this too) that in pop music (and to some degree in Jazz as well, as improv over a chord progression is very common) it's not uncommon to come up with a chord progression first and then write melodies to it.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Well, the music is close enough in style to a typical classical minuet that it's going to get compared to that. So, from that standpoint, there are a number of things "wrong".

Your key sig is C, but it starts in G Major, and thus should be written in G Major.

Your B section (begins in the key of C) should carry accidentals (naturals) for the F notes and just keep the key sig of G for the whole piece.

Subito means suddenly. It's not its own dynamic.

The octave A notes in m.7 sound really "bare". You've got a couple of other spots where you have a 4th, and so on. Those "open intervals" sound really empty - the octaves especially - it's as if the <b><u>harmony</u></b> drops out for a note or two. You seem to have avoided the F# in the A sections and I'm not sure if you didn't know you were in G and they didn't sound right so you left them out, but that's the perfect place for a C or F# to accompany those A notes in the melody, as you basically have a D7 <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

The B section - the idea is ok but usually the F melody note would be harmonized with a D in the bass, so the lowest notes in the LH would go C-D-E with the G in between. The E against F sounds pretty clunky. Likewise, you don't usually reverse the pattern like you did in m. 10.


In m.18 where does the low D go? When you repeat it goes back to 2nd space C. That's a bad idea. Lines like that usually "lead to" the note - so it would be better if that G-F#-E-D line was up an octave so it leads right into the C in the repeat.

On the 2nd pass, it jumps WAY up to B. That's just kind of crazy. Think about singing these lines  - no one wants to jump around like that. Instead, you need a 2nd ending that leads to that B for the A section, or a smoother way to get there from what you have (or a different starting note for the A section reprise).

There are lots of little problems like this throughout - and that's only the first one. 

Maybe you should try to write one, and fix it up and learn from that, before going on.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>not as much. Sometimes for just one part or section, but keeping it in the same basic key but adding more color chords, extensions, alterations and so on in the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, as well as secondary chords is more typical.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Just FWIW, if you say "quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b>" in a Jazz context, you are almost exclusively talking about quartal **voicings** of tertian chords rather than actual quartal <b><u>harmony</u></b> (except in more experimental forms).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK, here's the truth:

There IS a set of "principles" for training your ear.

And that is done in a style of music that also has "principles" like math that can be studied, analyzed, categorized, repeated, and more importantly, taught, and learned, in a manner where there are in fact correct and incorrect answers.

It's called "Tonality" or Tonal Music, which is part of the Common Practice Period style.

In Tonality, everything is in a "context". There are "knowns".

Outside of Tonality, we might say things are like 2X = Y where in Tonality, things are more like 2x3 = 6.

Now, before I go further, I want to point out something: Like math, it's something you have to "practice" and "use every day" and "have a reason to use" or else it's not going to be of any value, or going to stick with you.

So, "Ear-training" is a lost cause if you don't play an instrument (voice), aren't actively transcribing or otherwise making music etc. composing, or otherwise putting it to good use. IOW, it seems a lot of people on these forums think they need to learn Ear Training, or that it's going to make them able to do something, but it doesn't. It's just a skill, like sight reading, that can enhance your overall musicianship - but it doesn't do you any good if you can't do basic math - sort of like how I really don't need to figure the area of spheres (is it 4pir^2 ?) and I can't even figure out Pythagorean Theorem (not that I have ever needed to...) without knowing how to multiply and add. Heck, order of operations gets many a Facebook poster daily...

_______

So, here's how it works.

You need to use a system called "Moveable Do" which places the syllable "Do" on the TONIC - which is the most important note in Tonal music. You could use numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc where 1 would be the Tonic and that's OK as well.

But what you do is use the numerals or these "Solfege Syllables" (Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti) to SING patterns.

This serves two purposes: It helps you INTERNALIZE the sounds - because you have to THINK about how to produce them vocally while you're "hearing" them mentally, and you actually do HEAR things as you do them.

Now, what we do in college is, we listen to a melody, then try to write it down (Melodic Dictation) as well as having chords, or intervals played, which we try to identify. The latter is where those ear-training apps are pretty good tools actually. But the former it really helps to understand the KEY - the TONALITY.

Another thing we do is look at a melody we've never seen before, and try to sing it (Sight Singing). 

But, both of those melodic activities are helped by "ear training" which is, us learning to internalize these specific tonal principles.

______

Many suggest learning intervals like "A Major 6th is the first two notes of "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean".

But that is USELESS (OK, not totally useless, but less effective for what most of us really want to accomplish).

Instead we should be thinking, "The Key is C Major, and I'm seeing a G then an E on the page, so that is So, the 5th of the key, up to Mi, the 3rd of the key, which are also both part of the Tonic Triad".

You don't even have to even know the name of the interval!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (so many ! because that's the rabbit hole everyone falls down and gets lost).

IOW, we use a system of Sight Singing and Pitch Identification where we "fix" either "Do" (hence "Fixed Do Solfege" or a numeral like 1 to the Tonic note and then reference everything else to that.

Because that's what the actual music most of us are trying to train our ears to hear better is - tonal music. So it makes perfect sense to use a tonal approach to training your ear as well.

________

Unfortunately, most "training" even in college does not necessarily take this approach. If my college courses made it apparent, I was too rebellious at the time to notice, or they just didn't. It was actually after I graduated that it actually clicked for me - I was working a dead in job in a warehouse in the freezing cold trying to make it as a musician, now out of college with no prospects, and no musical culture to be around, and I decided to start using the solfege I had learned because I was needing to sing harmonies in a band and needing to find the 3rd of the chord and so on.

What I then finally realized - because now I actually had a USE for what I thought was a complete BS waste of time class, was that had I been smart enough to actually listen or pay attention (if it was even said) or better, grasped the concept of the relation this class had to Tonal Theory, I could actually put it to use. And then I was, and it actually made sense.

Now, we studied Theory along with it. We studied our instruments along with it. If you don't know theory, and you don't play an instrument, or aren't proficient at either, ear-training might not help you all that much - you have to get the "basics" down first. But if you do have them down, ear-training makes a great companion and supplement to your other musical pursuits.

But you have to walk before you run.

Sing a C Major Scale:

Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do up and down (or use numbers).

Then start singing the distances from Do to ever other note:

Do Re Do Mi Do Fa... and so on.

Then patterns like:

Do Mi Re Fa Mi So Fa La...

That's in thirds - try it in 4ths, 5ths, etc.

It's important ultimately that you're able to "orient" yourself to the Tonic Triad.

We always sang:

Do Mi So Mi Do SO Do (SO being the So below Do).

This "orients" your ear to the tonic Triad.

This makes singing intervals like "Do to La" easier, because you "hear" in your mind where "So" is as part of the tonic triad, and then sing La a note above this.

_______

Here's the important part: What this means is, rather than a melody that goes:

C E A G F D E

being thought of as "sing Major 3rd, then Perfect 4th, then 2nd down, another 2nd down, m3 down, 2nd, you think of it like this:

"Tonic, 3rd 6th 5th...etc. The Tonic, followed by the 3rd Scale Degree (or the 3rd of the Tonic chord) followed by the 6th scale degree, etc.

IOW, you don't sing "note to note" as so many online resources would have you believe - where you have to think of each successive interval as the beginning of some song.

here's how that goes:

C to E - oh that's a Major 3rd, which is the beginning to X song.

Now I need E to A, which is a Perfect 4th, and that's the beginning to Y song...

The problem is, you're treating each successive note as a "starting point" and referencing each successive note to that.

But in "tonal thinking" if you like, you're referencing everything to the Tonic note, or the Tonic Triad, and other known guideposts along the way, such as the Dominant Chord, the Subdominant chord, the Leading Tone, and things like that.

It's fine to say that a tritone is the beginning of "The Simpsons"....

But you're FAR more likely to encounter that interval in a piece of music as from Ti up to Fa, NOT Do up to Fi. And most likely as part of a V7 chord (Dominant chord). So if you know your Tonic and Dominant harmonies (which you learn by singing patterns to get them in your ear like above) then you can more accurately pinpoint where those notes are.

_____

Now this has largely been about singing them, but when you do so, you "internalize them" and what that means is, when you hear them in real music, you'll recognize them more easily.

So, another exercise to do is sit at a piano or other instrument, and play a chord, then sing each of the notes of the chord - but mentally you also need to reinforce which chord members - and if in a key, which scale degrees they are. Then you play say C and G, and sing an E in between. Then play C and A and find an F in between. And things like that. "complete the <b><u>harmony</u></b>" type exercises.

After a while, you start to really hear and internalize things like how Ti to Do sounds, how Fa to Mi (as part of a V7 to I resolution) sounds. How changing the m3 in a Tonic chord to M3 or vice versa sounds. What a 7th added to a chord sounds like and so on.
____

So to summarize, most people learn things backwards.

They start by learning one note referenced to the previous note. And that's how most resources approach it.

But what you should be doing is starting at the top:

Establish a Key, and reference everything to the Key Center.

Take that down to Primary Harmonies (I, V, and IV) and reference to them.

Take that down to scale degrees, and reference to other "guide post" scale degrees (1, 5, 4, 7, etc.)

Take that down to "successive intervals".

So, not enough time or space to go into huge detail, but what I'm trying to show you is there is in fact a path that can really help you out and that's the way you should try to learn things. But it's difficult to do online, and it's even more difficult if you have little to no theory skills and/or instrument/vocal experience.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>With this, and your other post, you're writing very "classical" forms, and writing music that is so close in style that when comparing it to that, it's "bad".

You don't have any <b><u>harmony</u></b> in a lot of spots - just octaves.

For example, in m. 3 you have a D then a C in the LH and that's just the same notes as the first part of each beat in the RH.

Again, you really need to go back to some basics of writing before trying to do multiple movements.

How many sonatinas have you played? Whose sonatinas are you modeling these on?
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Excellent for a first completed composition.

But, extremely repetitive and dare I say, "boring". I didn't listen past measure 11 - after the first repeat, that was all I could take.

Yes, the LH is horribly repetitive. A chord on each downbeat in the 2nd section - you at least had a decent melodic idea with direction in the first part.

The problem is, you have no "point of interest" beyond <b><u>harmony</u></b>. You're placing too much emphasis on harmonic movement and not enough on MELODY.

Basically, your 2nd section sounds like it's an "accompaniment without melody" - there should be a melody there, but no one wrote it yet!

Listen to and better yet, PLAY piano music by other composers and see what they do.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>As a teacher, a word of advice: If your assignment was to write a duet, and you're still "learning how to write music", then "experimenting" might not be the best ideas.

We as teachers are usually using exercises like this as an opportunity for you to show us you actually learned what we've been teaching and are now trying to include it in an assignment.

What exactly have you been studying?

You have a lot of octaves here so the Cello is not really adding anything other than doubling to the violin part - no real <b><u>harmony</u></b> - they're all unisons (octaves) on the down beats.

The 4th measure is especially clunky where you have the cello do the same notes as the violin but then have it move to G/F#.

Playing double stops on Cello is fine, but again, that might not really be what the exercise is intending.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Luke. Wow.

A couple of thoughts:

Notation - there are a couple of traditions with piano but generally speaking,  the lower staff is not so much the "bass" staff as it is the LH staff.

I would simply put all those down stemmed long notes in the accompaniment at the beginning in the lower staff - it's assumed the LH is going to take them.

This makes the stemming in both staves neater and you don't have all those upstemmed notes in the melody reaching so far above the staff - and having the slur lines have to arch over so high and so on.

The same is true in the more movement section towards the end - you do change at m. 57 and put he accomp in the lower staff. But really, again you could do it through that whole passage.

In fact, one tradition in engraving is that if the LH is playing in the upper staff, you should actually have nothing in the lower staff - no whole rest!

I would just notate it on both staves - again this saves the concern with multiple voices on one staff and all the upstems above the staff and tall slur arcs etc.

I might also suggest you consider either some meter changes around 48-49 - or - you know the notation you have is clean with quarter notes, but it's "wrong" and all those 16ths should be tied in like they are across the bar.

But at a page turn, and with the accomp pattern switching spots, someone may just totally miss the rhythmic shift, or not execute it in the way you really intend - a meter shift may help re-orient the player.

I love the way you get from 55 though 58-59 - though I'm not really sold on 60 - honestly, I love the way you made the transition, but not the notes you picked... sorry. The low E just sounds out of place based on everything else you've done in the piece. Or, the high A...maybe it's the <b><u>harmony</u></b> repeated in 60 or something - something is making that E/A 4th a little ineffective in my opinion. It's kind of the "big moment" in the piece, but at the same time it's kind of anti-climactic in a bad way (meaning, you may have wanted an anti climax or at least an unpredictable one, but I'm not so sure you pulled it off).

The piece is outstanding though and one of the best things I've seen on this forum especially of this style. I mean, it's every bit as good as anything professional I've ever heard (and of course, even better than some of that!).

From a listening standpoint, none of the score things would matter, so you could just leave the notation as is.

You could leave the piece as is too and it would still be gorgeous.

But you know, it's one of those things where I mention something you were also thinking about, or someone else mentions it as well, it might be worth re-investigating at least.

So that transition, it just didn't "do it" for me - and the rest of the piece "did it" so well for me, that that one transition kind of bums me out a little.

Still, it's only a little piece of bone found in one of the most luxurious hamburgers I've ever had!

Congratulations.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>That's not true. It's not just shit.

What you have are GREAT ideas.

It's working them out that's part of the "craft" of composition - and the hard part for everyone - even the greats!

Based on this and your other post, I'm not so sure you know chords and theory very well.

Let's take one measure, where your Eb notes begin in m.11.

Usually what would happen there is there would be a C in the LH against the Eb in the Rh, then on beat 2 the Eb would be in the LH and the C in the RH - so your order of notes in the LH would be opposite of what it is now - C to Eb rather than Eb to C.

What this does is provide a "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" consisting of C and Eb together rather than just the unison of two Ebs together which is not really <b><u>harmony</u></b> and can be rather "thin" sounding.

What you generally want is 3rds or 6ths between voices, and less often, 5ths - especially on the beats.

If you have a G in the melody, it should have an E or a B under it to make a 3rd or 6th.

These would imply (assuming the key of G) that you had a G <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or possibly an Em <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It could also imply a C <b><u>harmony</u></b> especially if a C note came right before or after.

You might could have a C below that G to imply a C <b><u>harmony</u></b> but that open 5th can also sound kind of "empty" harmonically speaking if there aren't other chord tones nearby to "fill it in".

You could have a G under a G, but we usually only do that at cadences, or maybe beginnings where we want to establish or confirm that the tonality is G. Otherwise, having plain octaves especially on each beat (even with other notes filling in between) have an empty and "non harmonious" sound.

Now, sometimes, a lower part will double an upper part for emphasis - and that's fine when you want that - but what you have is kind of a mix between the two, which is pretty unusual.

Here's a simple piece that has a melody with an accompaniment that is often just a single note (in broken octaves) the provides a <b><u>harmony</u></b> as well as rhythmic motion, that contrasts with secitions where the melody is doubled exactly in the bass:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBjjfUexPCA

Notice how in the first 2 measures it does use a 5th - A against D, but it also "fills in" the rest of the notes of a D chord. But it's not D in the melody and D in the bass on each beat like yours is.

The 3rd and 4th measures are doubling for emphasis - so he didn't want <b><u>harmony</u></b> there, and that's OK.

After the repeat bar which is the 2nd section, there's A in the bass and notice it has a C# in the melody - not an A. So you have a harmonious 3rd on each beat.

That whole section with the E that has the chromatic notes on top does have some octaves and more 5ths in the melody but he's setting up this dominant chord - called a dominant pedal which is common before a recapitulation (and part of a development idea).

At right at 30 seconds after the 16th notes in the RH that do in fact start on the octaves (the difference here between what this is doing and what you did is that this is staying on a single chord where you were often changing chords moving in what we call "parallel octaves") you'll see in the 2nd to last measure on that page:

E-G#-A-D in the RH against E-D-C#-D - notice that the octave E acts like an "final end" to this section of pedal E notes and then we get movement - so you get a G#/D pair and a C#/A pair - a diminished 5th and a 6th. Not octaves.

The last note is an 8ve and usually this is a no no but it's on a weak beat and goes by pretty un-noticed - and when we land on the next downbeat again it's a 6th of E to C#, not an 8ve. The last two notes are octave but that's because he's leading back to the doubling idea which continues on to the next page.

Check out this one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llZxwf8Dq4w

It begins with Bb over G - not two G notes or two Bb notes.

The second measure forms a Dm <b><u>harmony</u></b> with A-D-D but the bass note is F, so it forms a 3rd and 6th - again, not an octave on the beat or anywhere in the measure.

The next measure has Eb against G on the downbeat - not two G notes or two Eb notes - in fact the melodies of measures 2 and 3 don't even include the bass note in the melody lines!

The 4th measure - that's the dominant chord and he wants a big hit on that because it's the end of the phrase and important, so THAT one is an 8ve.

Measures 5 and 6 are great examples for you - notice that there is on 8ve on the down beats. But you would have written Eb on beat 1 of measure 5 and D on beat 1 of measure 6 to "go with" the melody notes.

If you scan through this one (which has many more chord changes than the previous one) you'll see that almost every measure begins with a 3rd or 6th between the bass and melody, except at cadences (m4, 12, and 16 and m8 has an open 5th).

In fact, I only count 8 instances on the first page on the melody even having the same note as the bass part, and of those, 2 are on beat 3, the weakest beat of the measure, and the rest are at cadences.

Yours by contrast has an octave on 21 occasions and the vast majority of those are on the beat for the same time span (and I'm not counting the spot where it looks like you intentionally doubled in mm. 13 and 14.

in the Musette, when there's an octave, it's less commonly on the beat, and, the chords are not changing (2 whole measures are the same chord at the beginning) and it's consider OK to have an 8ve like that within the same <b><u>harmony</u></b>. But since you're changing chords (like D to C with D in both the melody and the bass moving to C in both the melody and bass) it's considered to be "less harmonious" and "empty". That's fine if that's the effect you want but in this kind of context, it just sounds like you don't realize you're allowed to put different notes under the melody (though other parts of your piece make me think you know that's OK).

So i hope that helps. I'm not trying to crap all over your work, but trying to help you.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You could probably make a lot of analogies, but a Noun could be a stable, consonant <b><u>harmony</u></b>, while a verb - as we are often taught "action words" - are dissonant chords that demand resolution.

It could also be used just for function, like tonic is noun, while dominant - an "action" chord, is a verb.

Adjectives would be more like Secondary Dominants.

You could go crazy with this but IMHO it's better to keep the analogy rather broad because just like words can take on different meanings and functions, so can chords.

You could also apply this on multiple levels, such as higher level Key Areas, or just in melody alone - embellishments, chord tones, non-chord tones, and so on.

So I don't think there's any one specific answer to your question, just like "google" can be a noun or a verb (is it an adjective in "google doodle"?) a C Major chord can be many many things depending on the context.

So it's a helpful analogy, but not a 1:1 one, nor the only one.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;I don't understand why someone would claim such a thing

Sheer ignorance probably. I don't know why you're so worried about what one person on the internet claims when obviously you've given clear examples yourself to the contrary thus proving this one person simply wrong.

It's possible someone was talking about Monophonic music, where in things like Plainchant, there was no <b><u>harmony</u></b> prior to about the year 1000, and they were modal.

But if the context were pretty clear that the discussion was not about them, which is typically the case, then the person is either not able to read context clues, or is again simply unaware of the existence of modes in harmonic settings.

There may be some people who are being very nit-picky about what a mode is, or what modality is, and all that, and may be saying that "modal" music refers specifically to monophonic chant, and that "modern modality" is a different thing and is thus "not really modality" and basing their claim on that. But that of course is always suspicious in terms of motive and again awareness.

It is also possible someone is under-informed and things that modes are used only in chord-scale theory and thus not "chord progressions" as they're played over a single chord. 

They might be not understanding that the word "progression" is being used in a broad sense as it most typically is, where it just means a "succession of chords". We could say that Modal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> does not have the same kind of functionality as Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, but it can adopt things like functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and have substitute progressions that contextually are meant to imply the same kind of progression, or they can have their own "new functionality" that is exclusive to a given context, but that again is someone just trying to nit pick, or go off on a tangent, etc. as most people are simply talking about exactly what you posted - chord progressions in a mode.

Sometimes people want to point out additional or alternative interpretations, or make people aware that there is more to it than just what is being discussed, or that there are possible refinements to what's being discussed, and their motives are not necessarily ill-intended, but sometimes in text, by its very nature, come off that way or be easily misinterpreted that way. But some people do have very little knowledge, are unaware of their ignorance, or are trolls.

So lots of potential reasons, including not-so-obvious meritorious ones (or simple misinterpretations) but yes, chord progressions are used in modes.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>V+ is use to move to I, and I+ to IV.

The latter is kind of acting like V/IV to IV, but as V+/IV to IV.

Traditionally, + triads only resolve to Major triads, because the 3rd of the + chord as well as the raised 5th both continue upwards by half step like so:

G - G

B - C

D# - E

So notice if the C chord were Cm, the D# of the G+ would end up going to the Eb of the Cm chord and that doesn't really "work" as a resolution (though it could work in some other contexts one of which I'll hit below).

In essence, the + triad "arises from" voice leading, and that is taking the 5th of the V chord, or some secondary V chord, and raising it chromatically, to lead into the 3rd of the next chord.

Since I and V are the only two chords that have a dominant that's also a 4th below and in the key, they're the two most common ones.

But, you could have D+ in the key of C move to G, so like V+/V moving to V.

You could also do it to Eb, Ab, and Bb either in minor or borrowed in major.

So you could have a progression like:

C - Bb+ - Eb - G7 in C Major.

_____

Another way they're often found is through voice-leading as well, but as more of a Chromatic Elaboration of a Static <b><u>Harmony</u></b> akin to the "line cliché.

Cm - Cm/B - Cm/Bb - Cm/A etc. gives you a static Cm chord with a descending chromatic bass line.

But very often, the additional C is omitted from each chord, so you get:

Cm - B+ - Eb/Bb - Am7b5, etc.

This is the "Chim Chim Cheree" progression (which we'll probably start hearing a lot more of with the impending Disney cash grab)

Most peopled don't consider it "functional" in that context though as it's really "resultant of chromatic line" and not "independent". Even though the traditional use above is also originally from a chromatic move, + and 7#5 chords are often found as "stand alone" chords as well, especially now - so they've shed a lot of their origins and act on their own.

But you can absolutely non-functionally and as "color" chords, when they "sound right" so don't dismiss that outright or anything.

This piece is famous for using them:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYKl41e_hoU

I'm sure you know the + triad is symmetrical, meaning it can resolve in 3 ways, so it can be used for enharmonic modulations, though I can only recall ever seeing one piece that did this (Schubert or Schumann) and that property was never really exploited in classical music, and I'm not sure anyone really has done it in any contemporary music either.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The problem with stuff like this is that the "chord" is really based on mostly the bass and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> built from it, but other musicians are playing "chords" above it that alter it in various ways.

Think about this - if you have a C chord, you've got a C chord.

But if someone plays an Em, or a G over that "C focused <b><u>harmony</u></b>" it's going to sound not necessarily like a new *<b><u>harmony</u></b>* but the *chord* has changed because it's now Em7 or Cmaj9.


When the piano sound comes in, the last chord is different - that is, the last chord **that the piano part has** - but the basic vamp is still the same "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" going on.

I'm listening no laptop in a noisy environment so it's hard to tell, but all it sounds like to me is an extra extension is added to the chord - like a 9th getting added or something. There's one chord earlier - like the 5th or 6th chordal hit where it also sounds like they add a 6 or 4 into the chord as well.

These don't really functionally change the nature of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> but do provide some variety for the "re-loop".

It's not so noticeable earlier if at all - the backing synth part is kind of nebulous and "changes chords" in that it produces some note combinations that could be worked out as chords, but really it's more of a "pandiatonic arpeggio" where simply notes of the key are being "made active" in a repetitive pattern. The funk guitar kind of sound also just seems to be the same chord without the variation the piano has - so it really is just kind producing this static harmonic texture where additional notes enter and exit at will, keeping the vamp interesting harmonically, without it sort of "taking over" any of the more important ideas.

At least, that's what I can make out here.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>DRL47 is right - "what chord it is" is of secondary, or less, importance.

Now, sometimes - 2 part "counterpoint" **is** a "reduction" of what would be a fully harmonic texture and in those cases they are implying specific harmonies.

For example, in 2 part writing you're not typically going to do things like F-G moving to E-C or having the interval of a tritone appear in anything but passing motion.

But in "reduced" 2 part writing, the two voices are taking the "most important" notes of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> so it's clear of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> they're outlining - like V4/2 - I6 in the first example I just gave.

If you had:

F# - A - G

D - C - B

in the key of C, in a relatively "harmonic" texture, the C-A interval clearly is implying V4/2 of V - moving to V6, especially following the D/F# pair.

So dyads CAN have *implications* as to what <b><u>harmony</u></b> they are.

Here's another quick example - in 2 part "reductions" of full <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you'll often see something like:

E - D - C

G - F - E

At a cadence, the first dyad is clearly a I6/4, then the second is V4/2 and the last I6.

Because "this is what the chords would be if all the notes were present" - but they're not, and we have to include the "most important notes" that imply the harmonic function but also maintain the sonic characteristics of the chords (i.e. no open 5ths for example) and to some degree remain "legal counterpoint".

But I said "counterpoint" in quotes a couple of times up there because this kind of "reduction" is more of not really true 2 part counterpoint, but a reduction of a 3 or 4 part texture to just 2 voices, and it won't follow the same traditional counterpoint rules all the time because of that.

For "true" 2 part counterpoint though, you shouldn't be worrying about chords at all. It's about 2 voice combinations and melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>
&gt;Is there a proper name for a non-chord tone that is approached by leap and resolved by step?

Yes, appoggiatura :-)

Vornska is maybe hinting at their distaste for Kostka's/Payne's text where the authors use some now-common terms for some types of App, namely those approached by step. 

What V is essentially saying is, an APP is any unprepared dissonance (so that eliminates Suspensions and Retardations) that falls in an accented position.

This is the "classical" definition - a lot of older texts don't really differentiate between NCTs that are approached by step or leap, or "unprepared" - let's say there's a category of NCTs called "Accented NCTs" and in that category are 2 types, "Prepared" and "Unprepared". The Prepared ones have names - Suspension, Retardation, the Unprepared ones do not - other than App.

What K/P and some (many?) others do (and I'm not sure of historical precedent) is give names to other formula in the Unprepared family.

Accented Passing Tone and Accented Neighbor Tone - which are essentially "time-shifted" versions of their unaccented analogs. I've seen older texts just call these "app", so "aPT and aNT" might be "newer" (and seem so) and I'm not sure if they're an invention of K/P specifically, or have been around a long time, are unique to US teaching, etc. I smell a Thesis...

So that gives you the following accented formula:

C - C - B (Sus)

C - C - D (Ret)

D - C - B (aPT)

B - C - B (aNT)

All that's left is things like:

A - C - B

A - C - D

E - C - B

E - C - D

and with leaps larger than a 3rd.

These are still App, just like those approached by step, except they don't have any kind of other special name other than "Accented Incomplete Neighbor".

Incomplete Neighbor is not something I've encountered commonly and also seems older (or European etc.).

The "strict" definition of that is when there is no approach note at all - such as a passage that begins on a NCT coming off a rest in an accented position, that resolves by step into the chord.

But, since the "leaping to app" makes it appear that there's no note in that range approaching it (especially when the leap is like a 4th or larger) it too is sometimes classed as an Accented Incomplete Neighbor.

Really, if we were to follow the "time shifted model", these app should be called "Accented Escape Tone"

Here's a great quote:

&gt;Appoggiatura comes from the italian word appoggiare, which means literally "to lean." Thus they are leaning tones and are differentiating from suspensions due to the fact that are accented dissonances that are not carried over from a previous <b><u>harmony</u></b> but are struck "afresh" along with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and then resolve into a chord tone. **You will often see these referred to as "accented passing tones,"** (emphasis mine) but "appoggiatura" is still very much in the contemporary musician's vocabulary, so you should understand them in these terms. Often in Classical era music, the appogiatura was written as a small grace note, place ahead of the beat, but nevertheless designed to be played [on the beat]

So I mean, App are anything aside from Sus and Ret, which are both prepared, but some people call App that are approached by step either Accented Passing Tone or Accented Neighbor Tone and just continue to call those that are leapt to App. Then there are some that use Accented Incomplete Neighbor for App that are leapt to. Some may reserve App to specifically the NOTATION part of it - and our OP may have actually be asking about that and we've led them astray :-)







</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; To answer your question, my interest is really for <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and melody writing in the context of songwriting. I want to no have to guess so much when trying to find chords for my chorus when writing a verse and vice versa. 

So now the question is, how many songs can you play? How many songs have you learned?

Remember that most songwriters out there don't take theory - not in any kind of formal way.

I don't know (or remember if you said) how much you know already but if you don't know how Keys work, there's where you need to start.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Pierre Schaeffer coined the term to differentiate it from what he later termed "Musique Abstrait" or Abstract Music.

The latter is traditional music where music written on the paper is "abstracted from" the actual musical sounds. Notes on the page are merely a representation of sound, not the sound itself.

Schaeffer instead felt he was working directly with the sound, since it was recorded onto tape. Thus it was "concrete".

It is more a method than a genre, but, as with many things, as the originator of the genre he kind of set the standards.

Initially it was sounds recorded on to tape, then assembled and manipulated.

The term for music that incorporates acoustic instruments is Electroacoustic music, and Acousmatic music is similar, but all of the sound comes from speakers/electronics. Usually, Musique Concrete exists only a pre-recorded, while Acousmatic music could involve live players, and Electroacoustic music would involve acoustic instruments in combination with fixed media.

But, the terms are often used rather interchangeably even by the people who coined them (they were after all, trying to create inclusive musical forms).

Stylistically, "real" Musique Concrete is typically experimental and "sound art", lacking Melody, <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, and Rhythm in the traditional sense, or at least really de-emphasizing one or some combination.

Thus, while many rock records were recorded by one person on tape, and may splice, reverse, etc. it's not really "Musique Concrete" in spirit.

So that spirit is really "avant garde" or "experimental" or "sound collage" or whatever we want to call it. IOW, I'd be very hesitant to extend it to typical pop songs and even "artsy" pop songs or "poppy" art music might be a little looser than what the spirit seems to imply.

The same can generally be said about Acousmatic or Electroacoustic music - they tend to be "experimental" and not "traditional" forms of music either.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you have to pare it down to one theoretical thing, you could say that Jazz is based on the 7th chord as the base unit of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, while traditional music is based on the Triad as the base unit of <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

But, your Barbershop example isn't necessarily the same kind of example, because you're picking out something that happens in other styles, but is just ubiquitous to the point of cliché in Barbershop.

So for Jazz, "swing" would be a big one. "Syncopation" might be another. Those happen in other styles yes, but they (especially in combination) are certainly identifying factors of what Jazz is.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think any practice you can do is a good thing. The apps are very good for when you're in a place where you don't have access to a keyboard - so you can practice on a break at work with earphones or something.

But here's a question - have you identified the interval that is the first two notes of the melody of Summertime? Have you identified their relationship to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the key?

Can you sing it (even poorly) and find the notes above the first <b><u>harmony</u></b>?

Training your ear works best in musical context. It can definitely help to extract problem areas so you can concentrate on them and bring them up to snuff, but it's way more effective (and useful!) to be able to "hear the 3rd of the chord" or "hear the 5th of the chord" than it is to recognize the intervallic distance.

Furthemore, personally, I don't hear the distance BETWEEN two successive notes, but which chord notes they are or which scale degrees they are.

So if I hear G - Eb - G, I don't think "Major 3rd down, and that's the opening to such and such song" which is how a lot of Ear Training is taught.

Instead I think, 5th of the chord to 3rd of the chord and back. Or "scale degree 5 to scale degree 3 and back".

Then my theory tells me that, assuming I already have figured out it's a minor key that that distance is a major 3rd.

One of the best ways to do this is to Transcribe songs by ear - melodies, chords, and so on. Start with very simple melodies and try to "figure them out" at the keyboard. It will be a lot of trial and error at first, but the more you do it, the better you get at it.

But all of these activities kind of work together - you have to play and hear sounds, and then think about the sounds you're hearing - identifying them, paying attention to what X sounds like, and what Y sounds like, and then try transcribing stuff, and try playing a chord and singing each of the chord notes in turn, then leave out a note of the chord and fill that in with your voice, and so on.

Most apps just offer the supplement of additional practice and honestly, that's kind of what they should be primarily used for - IOW don't rely on it alone to "train your ear".
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Because chord symbols tell you the *<b><u>harmony</u></b>* not the *voicing*.

People don't seem to get this.

Here, let me explain it:

When I say:

A

What does it mean?

It doesn't mean A-C#-E. It means any combination of A notes, C# notes, and E notes that a person may play - or that was played which we now call an A chord.

A7 means the same thing. We call any combination of A, C#, E, and G, NO MATTER WHERE THE G IS, or the E is, or the A is, or the C# is, or how many duplicates there are.

A-C#-E-G is just as much A7 as A-G-C#-E or E-G-A-C#.

They are ALL an "A7" <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

The only thing we do do is notate the INVERSION. That's all.

C#-E-G-A is STILL an A7, though of course we'd call that one A7/C#.

But when you see an A7/C# chord symbol, you can voice the chord any freakin way you want as long as the C# is on the bottom, and the remaining notes provide the necessary tones to produce an A7 <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

C# - E - G - A,  or C# - G - E - A,  etc. They are all "A7" chords.

So the **fallacy** here is that people are taught by "stacking" the notes to produce chords so when they see "9" they think "it's stacked on top of the 7". But that's a really ill-informed thought process. That's not what music ACTUALLY does. It may often do it, but like the 7th, the 9th can be anywhere within the chord. It doesn't HAVE to be in the upper octave, or even above the 7th.

What we do is "list" the notes "in 3rds" starting from the root.

But that tells you **note content only** - not voicing.

A9 could be voiced A-B-C#-E-G, even though it's "note content" is A-C#-E-G-B

Again, only if some note other than the root is the lowest sounding note do we indicate that.

Here's really what everyone should be taught on Day 1:

1. Do not use chord symbols for specific voicings. They tell you "note content" only.

2. Inversions or alternate roots are notated in the format "chord/bass note". This is the ONLY thing we specify.

3. If you intend for people to play specific notes, write them down as notes.
____

If you want to know why the simple answer is, it evolved that way.

A lot of people all did it a similar way, then that became the "standard".

The players who were playing this music didn't care about voicing - it was Jazz - it was improvistory - they made up their own - they did what sounded good or created the sound they wanted - the played a different voicing every time that chord came up in the piece.

"9" implies a 7 is in the chord. "add9" implies there's not.

"add2" is superfluous because it's aready covered by "add9".

And "sus4" does NOT meanL

C - F - G

It could meam:

C-G-C-F  - should we then call that "sus11"? What if the bass note is an octave lower, is it now "sus18"?

What "sus" has come to mean is that the note is replacing the 3rd of the chord. The numbers 2 and 4 are used because they're on either side of 3 (plus historically, it was called a 4-3 suspension).

"add" simply means the 7th is not present, but it's understood as a continuation of extension, such that it's more like you have a 9th chord but have omitted the 7th.

______

Now, that doesn't mean people don't try to do this. Guitarists especially. But it's really a misunderstanding of what they system was designed to do. Chord symbols just tell you note content so you can produce the desired <b><u>harmony</u></b> (or not, in some cases, as some people treat it merely as a suggestion), not anything about voicing other than the lowest sounding note.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Traditionally, the 7th in the melody would not be doubled in the accompanying parts, especially if that Db continues on to a C.

It could be Db in the accompanying <b><u>harmony</u></b> for the first 3 8th notes of the 3rd and 4th beats (assuming 4/4) and then the Db in the accompaniment would then go away because it's taken over in the melody. But it could also just be an Eb chord and the Db in the melody essentially turns it into a 7th on that last 8th note.

"Stronger" is irrelevant. It's whatever the music needs at that point. It's actually a good place for a first inversion Eb or Eb7 chord.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, it's called an AUGMENTED SIXTH CHORD!!!! :-D

It is, kind of, a notational thing.

But really, it's a "resolution" thing.

+6 chords come from chromatic voice leading approaching the dominant scale degree. 

In C, think of it like this:

F# - G

Ab - G

Those notes might have come from a IV6 chord like so:

F - F# - G

A - Ab - G

In a sense, the +6 family of chords "aren't really chords at all" and some authors call them "sonorities" or "simultaneities" and things like that to help show that they arise from voice leading and are more simply a "happenstance" or "resultant" chord rather than a "stand alone" <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

-----

Traditionally speaking, altered notes want to continue in the direction they were altered. So b6 wants to go down to 5. #4 wants to go up to 5.

b6 to #4 intervallically is an +6 - so it "expands" because of the directionality inherent in the chromatic alterations (which is apparent because of the key).

By contrast:

Gb - F

Ab - Db

This would be a V7  - I in Db Major.

The 7th, traditionally resolves down by step. Again, this would be apparent by the key. If the key were Ab Major instead, this would be a V7/IV - IV - and there the Gb would have been altered - lowered - so it wants to keep going down to the F.

____

Part of this is a notational convention - we spell chromatic notes in the direction they go in a lot of contexts.

But it's also an AURAL convention.

And those together let us take advantage of the fact that at least a GERMAN +6 chord sounds like a V7 (dominant 7) chord, so we can resolve it despite how it is spelled - and as listeners we don't know how it's written on the music! We can only tell by its resolution.

What this allows a composer to do is spell it as say Ger+6 but resolve it as if it were a V7/?

So

F# - F

Eb - Db

C - Ab

Ab - Db

It's NOTATED AS a Ger+6, but RESOLVES LIKE a V7 of Db. In the key of C or Cm, this would sound like a tonicization of the Neapolitan or maybe a modulation to Db.

So we can kind of use this similarity in sound, and ambiguity of spelling to our advantage in what's called an "Enharmonic Modulation" (which can sometimes just be an Enharmonic Resolution but is often used in modulatory passages, hence the name). Same with o7 chords which can be "enharmonically re-interpreted" to resolve as if they were spelled a different way.

____

But the important thing about the whole +6 family of chords is the resolution of that +6 interval - that's what makes then different from any other chord, including any 7th chords they sound like.

Note: sometimes the #4 may resolve to 4 when the chord it goes to is a V7, meaning the outward resolution is "thwarted", but we assume this is intended and the chord quickly switched to a 7th chord on resolution. That doesn't negate the voice-leading origin and intent though.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I understand that, but that's not a "named chord".

What you're playing are Dyads, or what people simply can "an interval".

They are not chords in themselves, or at least not "named" chords, but they can imply chords.

in rock music, the "power chord" C5, D5, E5, etc. became so common as an implication of a "regular" chord like C or Cm, D or Dm, E or Em, etc. that it became an accepted name (only relatively recently - back in the 80s they called them "C omit5" and names like that.

If you play G and C, it creates the same <b><u>harmony</u></b> as C and G which is a power chord. It's just "upside down".

Or, if you played a power chord with the octave in it, you'd have 

C-G-C

one of your chords is the lower two of those three notes, the other is the upper two notes. But it's all a C5 chord.

The "proper" name of the "G4" would actually be C5/G but it's a little silly to name it that for just a Dyad (but if we HAD to give it a name, that's what it would have to be with the naming system we have).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Usually, a chord progression for a solo - like a guitar solo in in the middle of the song - has already been established by the song itself - the intro, the verse, the chorus.

Sometimes of course, completely new sections are written for solos.

However, I'd say that realistically, probably the vast majority of the time either the chord progression comes first, or, the solo and the chord progression are kind of conceived of at the same time.

But don't worry, the world is not going to come to an end if you "screw up" on the <b><u>harmony</u></b> side.

My suggestion would be, if the solo is well written, it should suggest a general harmonic scheme, and if you keep that scheme consistent with the rest of the song, then it should be OK.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's a 4-3 Suspension.

Generally, in analysis, Non-Chord Tones are not notated in the Roman Numeral Analysis and instead just notated in the score as they appear.

They did however appear in Figured Bass and some people use similar numerals in their Roman Numeral Analysis.

So it would be

V^4 - V^3 with a little horizontal line between the superscript 4 and 3 to show the 4-3 suspension movement.

Somewhat like this:

http://www.choraleguide.com/suspension.JPG

But many people don't even mark it, they just put V - - - - I and that's it.

In Jazz, if it's meant to be played from, you'd put Vsus4 - V - I.

It can be more convoluted, as shown here:

http://decipheringmusictheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/A6thcad64.png

Or like so:

http://decipheringmusictheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/A6thcad64.png

(the last has the V with a dash to show it sustains which is common in a Cadential 6/4 to 5/4 figure, but often the dash is in between the numerals).

This is more what I'm used to (again, a 6/4, not just the 4-3 suspension):

Or more like so:

Here's another:

https://academic.udayton.edu/PhillipMagnuson/soundpatterns/chromaticII/chromIIpix/SP34.4d.gif

The dash doesn't have to be there, but "V^4 " just looks a little odd by itself, especially since it's not a common inversion symbol so adding the dash that leads to a 3 helps to show you're just notating a 4-3 suspension within the numerals rather than in the score itself.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>&gt;but use inversions to your advantage 

Seconded.

It's kind of simplistic and repetitive, which is OK. But the next logical step would be to use more inversions (purposefully, not randomly) in your <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Correct. And your theory knowledge should just tell you that that's a P4!

So Do Do Do So Re Ti Do

Thinking of So Re as a 5th is tough, but hearing it as scale degree 2, and then with it leading to Ti, as part of a V chord <b><u>harmony</u></b>, helps to tie it all together.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; P.S. Isn't it odd that a '<b><u>harmony</u></b>' would include notes higher than the melody note?.

Not necessarily. But these are really just examples. They're more trying to show "B note, part of G chord" than any specific octaves or voicings, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Good question. No, we don't.

Historically and traditionally at least.

This is part of what "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>" is all about.

The V and vii^o chord have "Dominant Function" which means they lead to the Tonic Chord (and both contain the Leading Tone).

But III chords in minor are considered "mediant", or "variable" function rather than Dominant function. V and vii^o lead to I in Major, but iii doesn't.

So there's no real need to raise the 7th scale degree in a III chord because it doesn't resolve to i anyway.

So the basic idea is that the 7th scale degree is only altered in chords with Dominant function - that's V and vii^o - and not any other chords that contain scale degree 7.

This also means that the tonic chord with a 7th added gets the natural 7th, not the leading tone.

Jazz is slightly different as people do use chords based on "minor scale with a leading tone" or what we call Harmonic Minor, but in traditional tonal music, the 7th note of the scale was variable depending on whether the <b><u>harmony</u></b> was dominant or not.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yeah, what Jongtr said.

While we name those things different chords, it's really more like just a moving note within a static <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Line Cliche is more a jazz thing, and what you've described is more a pop thing (generally) so you could say it was a chord progression, even though it's really a static <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I wouldn't call it Line Cliche though.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you are preparing for an exam, you need to get the information from your teacher so you can score well on the exam.

Music is all about context, and so is stability. 1 is stable degree, being the tonic, until it's made part of a ii7 chord, where it becomes highly unstable and needs to resolve.

Generally speaking, the tones of the Tonic Triad are considered "stable" - 1, 3, and 5.

The rest are called "tendency tones" (rather than unstable) by more people.

7 wants to go to 8, 6 to 5, 4 to 3, and 2 to either 1 or 3.

Again though, these tendencies can be over-ridden in a <b><u>harmony</u></b> or depending on the context.

So you need to get the context from your teacher - as in, the context is what they taught you so you can get it right on the exam.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>That's not how it works.

To have a cadence, you need a "cessation" of harmonic motion, a "coming to rest". There are many types of cadences and which one you use depends on the sound you want, though stylistically speaking, some types of cadences are more commonly used in certain contexts than others.

In the Authentic Cadences, which are a Dominant <b><u>Harmony</u></b> to a Tonic <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, in Tonal Common Practice Period Style music, as well as styles inspired by/descended from, the Dominant <b><u>Harmony</u></b> will have scale degree 7 in it, which will seem to aurally resolve to the Tonic note in the Tonic <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, scale degree 1 (though it can actually go down to the 5th of the Tonic chord in some instances).

Here's a common cadence:

2 - 1 (down)

7 - 5 (down)

5 - 3 (down)

5 - 1 (up usually)

Some composers sometimes choose to take 7 up the half step to 1 so:

2 - 1 (down)

7 - 1 (down)

5 - 3 (down)

5 - 1 (up usually)

This results in a tripled root in the Tonic chord, which is typically done as the final I chord of a piece, though sometimes at the end of sections or phrases as well.

If scale degree 7 is in the highest voice, they pretty much always make it go up to 1.

&gt;I know that but you'd never go from root position tonic to root pos fifth and back again root tonic, you'll always use inversions in order to make the voice-leading pleasent. 

You wouldn't? How many pieces have you played? It happens frequently.

You don't "always" use inversions. You might use inversions if you want to - again, it depends on the sound you want.

&gt;That's my question -- is it the ONLY one min2 interval moving UPWARDS one of the notes of the tonic that makes it stable and complete.

Well, what makes it stable and complete is that it's ending on a chord that has been established aurally in the piece as the chord to end on - the Tonic. The approach to the tonic really doesn't have any effect on stability.

You can approach I with V or vii^o and it will have an upward resolving (if not technically, at least aurally) scale degree 7 to 1 which is a semitone in both Major and Minor keys.

However, you could approach it with IV and it would still be stable. iv - i in Minor has a semitone as well, but it happens in a different voice than it does in Major, so it's not quite the same as the V-I resolution.

With a V7 chord, there is an additional note that resolves by step - in Major it's a semitone, but in minor it's a whole step.

But you're focusing on something here that's really a non-issue - it's not the half step motion necessarily that makes the final chord stable. It's more than the note that is NOT the tonic but a half step away is present in the first chord that makes the first chord so "unstable" (not the best word, but "tending towards resolution" might be a better description).

IOW, the fact that the Dominant chord has scale degree 7 in it - which is called the Leading Tone - is what makes the V chord "want to lead towards" the Tonic chord. 

The half step resolution might be said to be "more satisfactory" but it really doesn't affect the stability of the Tonic chord - it's stable by virtue of being the Tonic.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;A#.

That's Bb.

It would depend on the context but as u/DanOwaR1990 points out, it would be D Dorian for at least the first 3 chords.

The Bb chord though comes from Dm.

Modern music is kind of weird like this as it often freely injects keys or modes with things from other keys and modes in a way that it becomes difficult to pick any one key or mode as the "center" of the piece.

For that reason, it's sometime better or more logical to say it's "in D" rather than specifically "it's in Dm" or "it's in D Dorian".

However, most of the time, for simplicity's sake, we go with the one that covers the most ground, or happens most of the time - since 3/4 of what you have here is D Dorian, it would be better to say it's in D Dorian, and you just simply have one chord from Dm (or D Aeolian if you must) in there.

If you replace the 3rd chord with G/B you're going to hear a SUPER common progression - Cream's "White Room" and "Tales of Brave Ulysses" both use this progression (in D) though sometimes the D is actually Major, making it Mixolydian until the Bb. But it can also be Dorian until the Bb. - see, it's all wibbly wobbly mode-y scale-y.

This BTW is a GREAT example of someone who could come on here and say "what key is my chord progression in" - well, without any further information, after correcting the Bb most of us would go "Dm" without hesitation.

But you gave us the additional context of lines that include B rather than Bb, so that turns this otherwise Dm progression into D Dorian, at least for the first 3 chords! (and that's because none of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> chords have a B or Bb in them so we can't tell from just those alone).

Have fun!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; It's interesting, isn't it, that although the C# seems like a NCT, the music treats it as a chord tone? 

This is what I call "chord status".

The evolution of <b><u>harmony</u></b> is one where things that are stand alone chords - that have already achieved "chord status" - have NCTs introduced which are at first bound by the laws of linear contrapuntal motion, then gradually achieve "chord status" - often by virtue of them simply being heard for longer periods of time.

A great example also comes from Haydn where a cadential progression like:

E - C

B - G

F - E

G - C

appears. It LOOKS LIKE maybe some kind of weird Em7b9 to C, but really it's a "G13" as we'd call it today - but it's a Dominant chord with an Escape Tone. I know you don't care for K/P but they call it a V7subs6 and I think that's a valid point they make - that this "thing" has achieved "chord status" by virtue of this NCT figure, and Escape Tone (so it would have been D - E - C in the upper part) has been lengthened such that the CT is no longer even present in the figure (the D) and the E, the ET, which would have often been just the last 8th note, or a 16th note before the resolution, has now been lengthened to sound for the entire <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Essentially, this is really how 7ths which originated as NCT dissonances "achieved chord tone status" such that we consider these structures "7th chords" and stand alone harmonies.

The +6 family is a similar thing - born out of voice-leading, but seen enough and sustained enough to be considered "stand alone" harmonies - they have achieved "chord status" now.

This example may be one where since we don't have a chord name for it really (in this context), it's still in it's "NCT Phase" - we're seeing evolution as it happens - it'll take until the IV7 - I in blues for it to be fully realized, but it's a start :-).

I would love to see a manuscript on this one though to see if the editor changed the note ;-)

What I will say is, Haydn is way under-rated. He gets a lot of credit for being the "father of classical music" and the "father of X genre" - String Quartet, Concerto, Piano Trio, Keyboard Sonata, Symphony - but he is about as crafty as one can get, harmonically, melodically, and so on. He too got more chromatic with age and really pushed juicy chromaticism along as much as Mozart or Beethoven.


From an analysis standpoint though, I think the Db is still, at this point, a NCT, though Haydn is playing with us - as all great composers do - and milking it for all it's worth.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;to do with the context in which its played?

Darn you did it to me again...

My answer from the title was "context", and then you said it in your next sentence!

Yes, context.

"consonant" and "dissonant" are actually not absolutes in music like many people think they are or would like them to be.

A long long time ago, music was primarily vocal based. The words consonance and dissonance actually evolved before <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and especially <b><u>harmony</u></b> as we know it.

So these words were used in dealing with MELODY - interval to interval.

And basically, "dissonance" would mean "hard to sing".

This is why though, we consider an interval like a Major 2nd a "dissonance" in a chord, but in a melodic interval, it's commonplace.

So melodic 7ths and 6ths were considered dissonances, though at some point the m6 interval became "OK". The Tritone was also a dissonance.

But a long time ago, they used Modes, and there were no accidentals - things like Augmented 2nds simply just didn't appear in Modes. And, they even altered the Tritone to make it "singable".

But this entire tradition of singing led to a reliance on diatonic notes and intervals and further adjustments to them to make them less dissonant when they did appear (as in the tritone becoming a P4) and ultimately when music became more chromatic these "new" chromatic additions were considered "outside the key" and thus "dissonant".

Of course, this primarily happens in Minor keys only, and they even did "correct" them by using Melodic Minor.

So an Augmented 2nd in minor is created by an alteration - rasing scale degree 7, so it's "out of the key" and it actually is a little more difficult to sing, even though it's aurally the same as a minor 3rd.

Actually, it's the same with raised 7 to b3 which is diminished 4th - aurally it sounds like a Major 3rd, but is a little harder to sing and outside of the system, hence "dissonant".

But the augmented 2nd is probably the one most often talked about (aside from the Tritone) because it appears so readily in Minor keys in what would otherwise be a "stepwise" melody.

So in the key of C Minor, the distance between Ab and B natural is a +2. And it's considered a melodic dissonance. (it can also appear in a B^o7 chord, where it's a harmonic dissonance as well).

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you want to write music for fun, you really don't need to study theory - especially in any formal sense.

There are in fact plenty of websites, a few of which are recommended by this forum and included in the links in the sidebar.

But really, what you need to do is learn music by other people, then emulate that. That's how musicians learn to make music. It's like how we learned to speak - we listened to other people, tried it ourselves, until it made sense. That's how musicians make music too.

Of course, what's harder is, you probably spend a year or more as a child listening and emulating, and for many people, they don't speak well unless they want to learn to speak well, which some can do by pushing themselves to learn to speak better (or as well as they can without any formal training) while others a perfectly fine without learning anything more than the basics.

As an older person though, it's harder to be willing to take that year - or more - to learn music - and you have to listen to it and emulate it - and in this case emulate means not only "speaking" music - playing it, but "writing" music - creating it.

So what do you need in language? To be able to read and write, and know the basics of spelling, and then have listened to and spoken/communicated with others enough that you have a solid grasp of the language.

What music theory is, is like defining parts of speech - noun, verb, adjective...and "diagramming sentences" which I despised in English class.

But I'm trying to think of the times I've needed to diagram a sentence since 10th grade? 0. And it's been a LONG time since 10th grade.

You need the "basics" of music, the "fundamentals" - notes, rhythm, keys, and meter, melody, and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and that's really about it for most of the music most people want to write.

Now, I will say if you study theory, yes, you're likely to be introduced to new concepts that could inspire you, so that's good. But also, a lot of concepts in "formal theory" are not always very applicable for the music most people want to write - I doubt figured bass is going to help most people - it's like diagramming sentences again. Additionally, you may be introduced to concepts you weren't previously familiar with - concepts you could have learned in songs if you actually played songs, but sometimes through theory study you'll come across something that will cause you to investigate it further in music - which again is a good thing.

But think of it this way - Shakespeare probably didn't even know what "Iambic Pentameter" was. He just wrote sonnets, and wrote them in a way that sounded good to him. But he did push himself to craft what he was doing into what we so revere today.

If you want to get away from the same old ideas and concepts, the first thing you need to do is change the radio station (or today, change your playlist I suppose). Theory is not going to help you do that. You still need **musical examples** so you can "internalize" what's happening in a musical context. Reading about "Borrowed Chords" would be great if you don't know about them - it's a simple thing that a lot of people don't seem to know about - but the reason is, not because they didn't study theory, but because they haven't played any music that includes them. A lot of people only listen to or play one style of music. You're not going to start using words like "panoply" just because you read in a book it's a noun. You have to hear it used in context, and start trying to use it in your own speech. In fact, it really doesn't matter if you know it's a noun or think it's an adjective - as long as you use it in a "grammatical" way (which comes from learning the language, not studying grammar necessarily) it's going to add something to your speech that not everyone uses in same old everyday conversation.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Gradually, and over an extended period of time (I guess that means the same thing, but to emphasize that it was a slow evolution!).

Really, it's not something that can be answered other than in digest form.

If I could put it any way that would make sense, the Modal system was "scale degree" and "rotationally" related, while the Tonal system was "transpositionally" related.

With Modal music, Dorian was D, period. In practice, people may have sung it at various pitches but in written music it was understood to be D.

What essentially happened was, as melody became more elaborate, and as <b><u>harmony</u></b> was included, there was a desire to eliminate dissonant melodic and harmonic intervals.

Thus, over time, it became more and more common to introduce Bb into the Modal system, which made some modes aurally similar to Major or Minor at least initially for brief stretches, the later longer ones.

Over time, this had the effect of sort of "hybridizing" or "neutering" the modes, such that Lydian and Mixolydian became this new thing, which was Ionian.

However, it also had the effect of creating "transposed modes" such that Dorian could now start on A for example.

So in a lot of modal music, you'd have a phrase in Dorian, then a phrase in Phrygian, then a phrase in Mixolydian, then a phrase in Dorian again. This is *sort of like* how a Tonal piece might modulate from D major, to Em, to A major then to D. But rather than "change key", it "changed Final" - but with transposing modes, you started to see rather than just the Final changing, the whole mode "shifting".

Then another big factor was that over time, composers came to prefer cadences that inlcuded a semi-tone approach to the Final. Phrygian and Lydian already had them, but in modes like Dorian and Mixolydian, a note had to be changed - C# added in Dorian, and B natural added in Mixolydian.

Add a Bb to Lydian, and change the Bb to Bn in Mixolydian, and you have Ionian. Add C# to Dorian and you have what is basically Melodic Minor. Add the Bb you have Harmonic Minor, and only the Bb you have Aeolian.

But this changing of the cadential notes initially created what we'd call today a vii^o6 to I or i motion. Over time, through counterpoint in 4 or more voices, we end up with the now familiar V7 - I or i cadence.

Ultimately, as the ability to transpose modes explored more distant transpositions, and the use of Bb, F#, Eb, C# etc. increased, and as the 8 Ecclesiastical Modes were "hybridized" into Ionian and Aeolian, music slowly became "about" the relationship between "modes" with different "Tonics" than it did about Modes being related to each other "rotationally" (that's a later concept, but the way they were used is similar enough to make the comparison).

So obviously this didn't happen over night, and there wasn't any one event really that pinpoints the change. Many scholars consider the music of Corelli to be the first "Tonal" music but if you listen to the music of a generation before, that stuff is so "Ionian" it's really hard to say if it's Tonal or not. There were funky things happening like scholars debating whether a specific piece was in one mode, or two modes simultaneously, and if that was itself creating some new type of mode.

Remember that Theory describes things that already happened in music. People like Glareanus were simply observing trends already happening in music - which is why he added Ionian and Aeolian to the system (though he did it in the "older" Ecclesiastical context of including Hypo- modes, and not as some new thing leading to Tonality - which he couldn't comprehend from his vantage point). Same thing for Rameau once we get into Tonality.

And, at the juncture, you can be sure that older dudes were composing Modally while younger cats were composing Tonally - like how in the 1950s some people were composing Jazz still, while others were experimenting with this new rock and roll thing.

Modality remained in Sacred music, and even Tonal composers still had some Modal inflections in their music - a lot of Bach Chorales are better described as "Tonalized Phrygian" than truly Tonal. IOW, Bach is still a little more Modal than theory texts would lead you to believe.

Also, in general, Minor Keys show a much greater influence of Modality with the way Harmonic and Melodic Minor work, and chords like the Neapolitan and things like the so-named "Phrygian Half Cadence" - minor was slower to fully tonalize (or maybe, it never did...).

So obviously, this is not meant to be authoritative in any way, just a brief overview of some of the things that happened - there are books upon books written on this subject but it's one of those things where you can't really pinpoint any single thing or single time, musical tastes just changed (possibly due to non-musical influences as well) and things like the rise of instrumental music and secular music are major factors as well.

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br> &gt;the chords themselves achieve "note" status as in Bartok and Debussy.

THANK YOU! You just linked something for me I hadn't realized.

I've often also thought that when you get into, for example, parallism/planing, the "chord" is no longer acting as a chord, but a "note" - there are melodies made of chords where the chord is "subsumed" into this "unit" that's really "just one thing" - a "chord-note" rather than 3 (etc.) individual components.

This really ties together some of my thoughts on modern music.

It's like there's this huge arc in music where we started with notes, added "<b><u>harmony</u></b>" that wasn't really <b><u>harmony</u></b> but more a "doubling" of the notes - a "color changer" because it was parallel. Then with counterpoint, line starts to produce "complex melodies" that themselves form harmonies, until we get to more homorhythmic styles where the lines almost disappear and we get "three melodic notes combining into this new thing, a "chord" and then those chords themselves have melodies added, which then subsume into the chord unit again, then over and over until we get these chords that nothing more gets added to, but become linear as a single unit again - planing, parallism, power chords in rock, constant structure <b><u>harmony</u></b> in jazz....

Gonna have to ponder on this for a while.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The "Ecclesiastical Modes".

There are 8. Four are the names you know: Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, and Mixolydian. Those are called the "Authentic Modes". 

But there are also "Plagal Modes" which all have the Hypo- prefix, like Hypodorian.

Dorian is Mode 1, but Hypodorian is Mode 2, so I don't have the original post in front of me but Mode 5 should be Lydian. Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, and Mixolydian are 1 3 5 7.


The "Final" is a name that I believe comes from the time period - the "Finalis". Hard to explain, but it's a conceptual difference. Modes all use the same exact notes, so what is important is the Range (Ambitus), Final, and Dominant (Reciting tone).

It's so distant because it's like hundreds of years older! Look at how different Punk is from Jazz and there were people still writing Jazz while Punk was out. Modes go back to ancient Greece but they were codified about the time of the fall of Rome (and thus the rise of the Roman Catholic Church and the Papacy) which was about 476 AD. By 850 the "Gregorian" system (named after pope Gregory) was codified. Tonality really doesn't start until almost 1,000 years later!

You might thing of the Reciting Tone (also often called the Dominant) as being "the second most important note" and by that standard it is like the Dominant <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in Tonal music. But it doesn't really play the same role per se - there are some similarities we could draw but again it's conceptually different.

One thing that happens in music history is a recycling of old terms in new conceptual guises - we still use "Authentic" and "Plagal", but in terms of Cadences, not modes. We still use "mode", but in terms of 7 rotations of a scale, not 8 Ecclesiastical modes. We still use "dominant", but it's not the same as the modal "dominant".

I don't know if people misunderstand the terms and they just start getting used differently through ignorance or if they're forgotten and then resurrected in a different meaning just because someone thought it was similar or just cool to use an older word or what, but it happens all the time.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'd agree this is true in a very general sense.

"Classicism" as an artistic movement is actually defined by things like symmetry, economic use of materials, and even what we might calle "square-ness".

So by its very nature it tends to focus on simple 2:1 (and 3:1) divisions and subdivisions rhythmically speaking.

Of course this is a vast oversimplification. Take an Iron Maiden song, with its galloping 8+16th figures, and compare it to Beethoven's 7th, and you'll see they have a lot in common.

Obviously though, there are certainly rhythmically simplistic top 40 songs, and rhythmically complex classical songs.

I think u/Jongtr hit the nail on the head (as usual) - Classical music (especially Classical Period) tends to focus more on <b><u>Harmony</u></b>, Inversions, Harmonic Tension and Resolution, Harmonic Motion, Large Scale Harmonic Relationships, and dare I say, Melody, while keeping Rhythm more straightforward. Most pop music instead places more emphasis on Rhythm, and is far less concerned with <b><u>Harmony</u></b> in many ways (simple chords, no tension/resolution in those chords, scant use of inversions, no large scale harmonic relationships - even modulation by any means but direct modulation is rare in pop music in general - and we could even say much pop music doesn't have much in the way of melody).

Personally, though I wish all musicians would be forced to play nothing but rhythms for 4 years before they were allowed to change pitch at all, and that rhythm SHOULD be a part of music theory but usually is only barely touched on, I don't think this is a misunderstanding of rhythm on your part.

It's actually kind of inconsequential and in this case, not really part of music theory. Look at it this way: you can't fault Classical (Period) Music for being sticking to the things that make it Classical Music. If it didn't, it'd be a different style.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't know that I can offer good advice here. It's kind of like you're mixing methods a bit which is what kind of sets you up for this kind of problem.

I'd suggest that the solution may be to not be too rigid with your <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and if you write a contrapuntal line that indicates a new <b><u>harmony</u></b>, just go with that. IOW, the harmonic framework you begin with is just that - a framework.

YES. FINALLY. Someone with some sense :-D

&gt;I was wondering if there were any good resources on other dances / sub-genres / styles that are defined by a specific melody, <b><u>harmony</u></b> or rhythm (or combination of these). Following Wikipedia's "See also" links unfortunately only goes so far.

Yes. The pieces themselves.

And the reason it only goes so far is because these are actually not major factors.

There are "stock harmonies" and "stock rhythms" but some of them are VERY general - like, "Sarabandes feature an emphasis on Beat 2". That's it. You study some Sarabandes to see how they do it. But other than that, there's nothing else really similar from Sarabande to Sarabande. "Waltz" - well, it's in 3/4 with an "oom pah pah" accompaniment. That's about it. There are so many variations it's difficult to really describe anything more, and that's why Wiki can't really offer you much.

Folia, Passacaglia, Passpied, Passamezzo (all similar), Ground Bass all refer to a "stock" pattern - think like how 12-bar blues is now.

Baroque Suites are probably the other place to start as they contain "stylized" dances (dances not meant to be danced to, but inspired by the original forms) that contain enough "constraints" that can help you - Jigs are usually "dancy" and in 6/8. Minuets are generally "stately" and in 3/4.

There are other similar dances like Tarantella (Tarantula -think motion of the spider) but lesser known forms like "Jump Ups" and Salterellos and things like that.

So those are great places to look.

The chords are not usually specific, but rhythms and meter are often kind of "pre-described" if you will. Melodic figures are generally not.

More important is the Form of the piece - which is often more consistent (Binary, Ternary, Rounded Binary, Divisions, Through Composed, etc.)

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Remember that Chord Symbols do NOT show voicing, even though many people attempt to use them this way.

All Chord Symbols are just "shorthand" already - rather than writing out the notes. They're *supposed to* just show you the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, not what actual voicing and even notes to use. In some ways, they're merely a suggestion for performance.

C/B is just further shorthand for Cmaj7/B.

Now, Jazz and Pop are two different styles, and Jazz Players simply won't typically play just a C triad (they MUST put at least a 7th on everything ;-) just because they know the Bass instrument is taking the B. Similarly, they wouldn't just play a C triad if they knew the melody note was B. Heck, if you just give them "C" as a symbol, they're going to play Cmaj7, C6, C6/9, Cmaj7#11, Cmaj9, Cadd9, or whatever. And most pianists aren't going to think of LH vs. RH - if the bass is B, and they're playing C-E-G by chance in the RH, in their mind the <b><u>harmony</u></b> they're playing is Cmaj7.

Now, I will say that in Pop music, especially rock, there is more of a tendency to not only try to show voicing, but because of the use of Guitar and Bass, or Piano and Bass, etc. and a greater preponderance of just plain Triads (or even Power Chords) these symbols can be used in contexts where they "make sense".

But, IOW, C/B should not simply be taken as "since there's guitar and bass in the band, the bass player plays B and the guitarist just plays C". They might, but like in jazz where the bass player is probably NOT going to play ONLY the written Bass note, but other chord/scale tones as well, pop players may also still elaborate.

Yet where the context becomes important is in passages like this:

C - C/B - C/Bb - C/A

or

A - C/A - D/A - F/A

Both of these in a rock context are intended to show either a moving Bass under a static chord, or a moving chord (triad) above a static bass. Both of which are extremely common moves.

But there's nothing worse to me in a context like this when someone calls the C/A "Am7"!

This is for "naming" chords in an already written song though.

IOW, don't use C/B to try to tell someone to play a C triad, letting the bass take the B. Simply use it because it takes less characters on the page. Unless it's in the context I just mentioned and part of a pattern like that.

So outside of that kind of context, C/B and Cmaj7/B are "the same thing" for most people, except those who think or want to try to make symbols mean voicing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Major

Minor

Dorian

Mixolydian

"Blues"

Which can be the so-called "Composite Blues Scale", but is like a combination of both Minor Pentatonic and Major Pentatonic often with an added b5 additional blue note.

Check this out. Here is C Major:

C D E F G A B (C)

Here is C Minor:

C D Eb F G Ab Bb (C) - notice how 3, 6, and 7 are lowered.

Here is C Major Pentatonic:

C D E G A - it's C Major, without 4 and 7

Here's C Minor Pentatonic:

C Eb F G Bb - it's C Minor, without 2 and 6

Eb and Bb are the "Blue notes" in the key of C.

So you can play C Major - won't sound very bluesy, or C Minor - can sound bluesy but the b6 is not typical (but bear with me). You can play Major Pent - also not so bluesy, but common, and C Minor Pent - which has both b3 and b7, without the pesky b6, so very bluesy!

C Dorian is:

C D Eb F G A Bb (C) - notice also b3 and b7, but no pesky b6! Notice it's the same as minor, but with only b3 and b7, not b6 as well. Or you could say, it's Major with b3 and b7.

C Mixolydian is:

C D E F G A Bb - so like major, with b7 - only one of the blue notes. But still more bluesy than just plain old C Major. In fact, this is the way most harmonica players play!

So what we're beginning to see is, the 3 can be either flat or natural, and the 7 is more often flat.

But, if you notice, Harmonica players for one, often don't necessarily play 3 or b3, they play "in between" the two, bending notes. So do guitarists, and vocalists. But Pianists can't, so they often include BOTH.

So the "Composite Blues Scale" is:

C D Eb E F G A Bb (C)

It's got the b3 and b7 for bluesy-ness, but it also has the regular 3 for when it's needed (usually when the piece is more C Major than C minor).

If you look closely, you can find C Dorian, C Mixolydian, C Major Pentatonic and C Minor Pentatonic all in there!!!

Now, to give you an example in a more bluesy context how it can be used, when you play the I7 chord, it's usually more Major - it can take the b3, or in between b3 and 3, but can also use plain old 3. So it's like you're playing the Mixolydian Part of the scale, or the entire CBS.

But when you go to a IV7, the 3 really sounds kind of out or unusual (it's uncommon for sure). So you use the b3 instead - which makes it like C Dorian - you wouldn't want to use the whole CBS here on C (you could shift it to F though) because that 3 is really going to clash.

So you can think about the CBS as "being composed of" elements of both Mixolydian and Dorian, and Major and Minor Pentatonic - in fact it's not uncommon to see people use Major Pentatonic with an added b3 like:

C-D-Eb-E-G-A - which we could see as Major Pent with added b3, or CBS with missing 4 and 7.

So you can kind of see the CBS as this note pool you can draw from where it helps you incorporate they "bluesy" notes of b3 and b7, without the annoyance of b6 from pure minor, or only 3 over any chords that is sound funky with.

You can add in a b5 to any of these to make them even more bluesy, but it's so very common in a Minor Pentatonic that you'll hear some people call this "the" Blues Scale:

C - Eb - F - Gb - G - Bb.

So really what you sort of need is Major and Minor, then the CBS, which itself consists of Major and Minor Pentatonic, and Dorian and Mixolydian elements.

You can see Minor Pent as a subset of Minor, or a subset of Dorian, or a subset of CBS - it doesn't really matter - and that's why Pentatonics tend to work well in so many contexts.

FWIW, "R&amp;B" today means something different than it did with music from the 80s and 90s, and then something different from its original meaning in the 50s and 60s.

"The term "rhythm and blues" has undergone a number of shifts in meaning. In the early 1950s, it was frequently applied to blues records.[4] Starting in the mid-1950s, after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll, the term "R&amp;B" became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music. In the 1960s, several British rock bands such as the Rolling Stones, the Who and the Animals were referred to and promoted as being R&amp;B bands; posters for the Who's residency at the Marquee Club in 1964 contained the slogan, "Maximum R&amp;B".[5] Their mix of rock and roll and R&amp;B is now known as "British rhythm and blues". By the 1970s, the term "rhythm and blues" changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk. In the 1980s, a newer style of R&amp;B developed, becoming known as "contemporary R&amp;B". It combines elements of rhythm and blues, pop, soul, funk, hip hop, and electronic music. Popular R&amp;B vocalists at the end of the 20th century included Prince, R. Kelly, Stevie Wonder,[6] Chaka Khan, Whitney Houston,[6][7][8] and Mariah Carey.[7][9][10]"

"contemporary" R&amp;B is in some ways, more commercialized yet, and in many ways, watered down. We're seeing a resurgence of original elements in the "neo" genres like "Neo Soul" and "Neo Jazz" which really mixes a lot of the various elements that have been used over time.

But look at some Prince guitar solos, or some Stevie Wonder licks, and you'll have "blues licks" all over the place. They're still using that same basic thing - Major, Minor, and when they want to be bluesy, Blues Scales (though Stevie Wonder certainly could go farther into the Jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b> realm with additional scales and modulations etc. but that's a different ball of wax).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Very simple: Music is not about <b><u>harmony</u></b> ;-)

First of all, I had to kind of laugh at your title - "unconventional <b><u>harmony</u></b> in Ravel"? Well I damn well hope so. It's Ravel, not Mozart (who used a few unconventional harmonies here and there too).

&gt;This piece is very classical in its structure 

Yes. And that's what it is. This is actually something is WAY under-discussed and under-researched IMHO and that is that you can get away with murder melodically and harmonically speaking if the RHYTHM is regular and familiar.

What makes a lot of people have a distaste for Expressionist, "angular", 12 Tone music is NOT the lack of tonality, but the crazy rhythms that present no sense of regular pulse and feature all kinds of "backwards agogic accent" that all contribute to obscuring the meter. They think it's because it's Atonal, but it's really because its Ametric.

The Ravel is a case in point.

IOW, we can handle Atonality with no problem. It's the Ametrical part that actually bugs us.

If you were to take a completely tonal piece, and present in some whacked out rhythm, people would be "this makes no sense".

and u/Roderik_Stark 's response is worth re-reading - it is they RHYTHMS that give it a sense of cohesion, and the regularity of phrasing, and the cadences do sound rather "familiar" so we're cool with it. Also, there's this sense on page 2 when the higher note comes in that it's just this very typical type of piece, "with wrong note <b><u>harmony</u></b>".

Granted, his melodic and harmonic choices are not just totally random - look at the low notes - it's a big fat vi - ii - V - I - it's highly decorated with chromatic tones, but that underlying harmonic move (as well as harmonic rhythm) gives the same kind of cohesion that the regularity of rhythm and phrase (and repetition of course, which is really a major thing in many cases).

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Most people don't know this, but there are many - MANY - pieces of classical music that end on just the Tonic NOTE, or just the Root and 3rd of the chord.

And of course, who says you have to have <b><u>harmony</u></b>! Gregorian Chant didn't use it and you could write solo music in Locrian.

Who says you have to stick to Tertian <b><u>Harmony</u></b>! Maybe Quartal or Secundal <b><u>Harmony</u></b> would be more effective for this mode.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; You're not serious , are you? 

No. It's an overstatement to point out how people place more emphasis on <b><u>harmony</u></b> and not enough emphasis on other things that are just as musically important, such as rhythm, form, melody, etc. Things that get overshadowed on forums like this where it seems everyone thinks it's *all* about <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

The Chopin was an overview.

I have neither the time, nor the available space in a response to analyze everything in minute detail. I try to address what I read as the primary point of a poster's question, and get them started in the right direction, to they can see forests for trees, without dwelling on bark.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;if I want to create chords in a mode, do I use that specific scale? 

Yes. If you're writing music "in X mode" then all the melody notes and <b><u>harmony</u></b> notes come from X mode (of course, you can still use notes outside of the mode but you have to do so carefully).

&gt;Also If im in a key like C Lydian, am I focusing on the F#? 

Lydian is not really a "key", but if you are in a Mode like C Lydian, you focus on the F# only to make it clearly NOT C Major, which it could easily be confused with if the F# were not used, rarely used, etc. So you'd want to include chords with F#, and melodies with F#, because that makes it obviously not C Major.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>

Short answer, no.

Bb - A - Ab

G - Gb - F

E - B - C (escape tone)

C  - C - F

the middle chord is C - B - F# - A

That's no traditional chord. I mean we could call it a Cmaj13(#11) but really its a "resultant sonority" not a stand alone <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Things like this happen quite frequently in music (especially more contrapuntal music like fugues). As long as they follow the basic rules of counterpoint and non-chord tones, and make sense sonically, it's fine. But let's just say that more typically, not all 4 notes, or even 3 move to create new "odd" chords - it's fairly rare comparatively (IOW, it happens frequently, but no where near as frequently as only 1 or 2 NCTs moving between two chords).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You're overthinking it.

What it most often means is that rather than playing every single note of an entire <b><u>harmony</u></b>, some notes are left out that are "unimportant" do defining the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

For example, playing just F# and C in the context of the key of G major can, by itself, imply a D7 chord. The D and A are not present, but arually speaking, the F# and C are enough information for us to *infer* that this is a D7 chord. This is especially true if the two notes resolve to G as we'd expect.

Sometimes people use the word "implied" in other ways. For example, moving from a V7 chord to a I^6 is a no-no in common practice music because it "implies" Parallel Octaves.

What this means is, in the key of C major, the F note of a G7 chord should go down to E.

But based on the inversions, the bass notes will also go G to E - so it's kind of implied that the G to E motion in the bass parallels the F-E motion above, and the G-E is "filled in" with the implied F note, making it parallel octaves.

If you hear a song where the key is well established, and the last two notes just go "So Do" with no <b><u>harmony</u></b>, this implies V-I cadence.


But these aren't things people are sitting around going "I want to imply this note without actually playing it". Instead, it's musical patterns that are well worn in the musical vocabulary and so common that everyone naturally understands what it means.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You would want to use turnarounds in your music if you're interested in using turnarounds in your music. That's really all.

If you are playing a style of music that uses turnarounds frequently, then you'd probably want to also use them, so your music would sound stylistically congruent with the style you're emulating.

It's kind of like asking, "why would I want to use Blue notes?" Well, if you're writing anything you're going to call "blues", then you're going to want to include Blue notes, because it won't sound very bluesy without them.

You don't really seem to know what a turnaround is. If you're just learning theory, each time you hear a term, don't go, "Oh crap, am I supposed to be using this?" Instead, you need to research what it is, how they're used, find examples and so on. Many people who learn to play blues and jazz actually play turnarounds long before they know what the name for it is.

If you listen to music, and play music (which you should be doing 90% of, with theory only taking up 10%) then you'll notice that very often, at the end of a phrase or line, or section, the music does something to help "propel" the music into the next section or a repeat of the previous section.

In jazz and blues, this is called a turnaround. It's a place where harmonic motion usually increases (like 4 chords per measure instead of 1 chord per measure) and also where *stock patterns* are common (which you should learn to *play*) to lead you back.

Think if it like a "chord fill" - very often, you'll have a singer sing 7 measures of music, then end on the 8th measure's 1st beat. Drummers will then usually fill up the rest of that measure with a fill (that's why it's called a "fill"!) which helps keep some activity and interest going while the vocal is not. It may also be a musical fill on an instrument or instruments or even background vocals etc.

A Turnaround is like a "chordal fill" where the end of a phrase or section of music is "filled up" with more harmonic activity (and often some melodic riff as well, and again many are stock patterns you should learn to play), They sort of both re-emphasize the ending of the phrase and help to bridge the time between the end of the first phrase and the next, and even "lead into" the next section.

These are super common in blues and jazz and considered part of the typical vocabulary of those styles. Are you writing blues or jazz? Do you want it to sound "typical" of those styles? If so, you'd want to use turnarounds. Are you writing pop or classical music? Those styles don't typically use turnarounds (unless we really stretch the definition) unless they're paying homage to or mimicking a blues or jazz tune. So you probably wouldn't want to use them there unless you were intentionally trying to mix styles.

You don't really use them "over" (unless by that you mean "instead of") regular chord progressions - they are a chord progression (typically). 

In a 12 bar blues, the pattern is:

I - I - I - I

IV - IV - I - I

V - IV - I - I

The last two measures is were the turnaround typically appears, so the last line will look like:

V - IV - [I-IV-I-V]

Harmonically speaking, ending on V instead of I also creates a sense of "demanding continuation" and "resolving the <b><u>harmony</u></b>" which happens on the next phrase. So rather than end on I like the "basic" 12 bar scheme, the turnaround lets the phrase end on measure 7's beat 1, then "some frilly stuff to happen" that ends up on a V chord to "turn around" - set us up for the repeat back to the beginning of the form.

The above example is not the only kind, and in Jazz they commonly consist of patterns like vi - ii - V - I but there are many many variations which is why you need to learn to play them, and take notice of what happens.

HTH


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; The TL;DR is essentially jazz players often assume a chord that isn't a regular triad, often the 7th. Thus, a jazz player may refer to a 7th chord (or other variation) as the "standard" chord instead of the typical triad. Yes?

Yes.

&gt;If so, how would they say "the regular C" if they did only use a triad? Just like that? Curious of jazz theory has rules for how the alternate naming works. 

A Jazz player - play JUST a triad? Heresy!!!

Seriously though, what I mean is, if you write "C" in a chart, it's doubtful most players would play a basic C triad.

They're going to play C6, C6/9, Cadd9, some quartal C chord, Cmaj7, C7 if it's bluesy, etc. etc. etc. And they may even play what equates to Em7 (for a Cmaj9 sound) and so on.

I don't mean that if they see the notes C-E-G on the page they're going to call that C6 or Cmaj7 etc. Just that when they (we, because I play it too) see a "C", it's understood that you want "some kind of <b><u>harmony</u></b> with "C-ness" to it". And if they just see C^o, it's assumed it means C^o7 (and in fact, in that case, it's even more pretty much assumed).

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Errr, not sure, but it's kind of backwards.

If you notate "Cmaj7" a Jazz player may play Cmaj7, but they may also play C6, Cmaj9, Cadd9, C6/9 and so on.

I discussed this in another thread recently. Even if you put just "C", no jazz player is going to typically just play a C.

Let's say this: In jazz *performance*, which is anywhere from moderately to heavily improvised, chord symbols are merely suggestions. A player will "jazz up" a chord symbol any way they see fit or feel appropriate. They don't see "Cmaj7" as a "particular chord" but a "suggestion of a possible <b><u>harmony</u></b> that is "C majorish". As long as the chord as "C ness" and "majorish ness" to it, they'll play it. That also includes the possibility of direct functionally equivalent harmonies like Em7, which in the context of "C ness" is a "Cmaj9 sound". 

This is what people don't seem to understand about chord symbols. They don't tell you what to play, and they're not supposed to. They tell you the desired or "suggested" <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or, "the <b><u>harmony</u></b> someone else played in a popular version" and things like that.

Now *analysis* is different - we'll look at a set of notes and go "that's Cmaj7". 

Rock/Pop and Classical music are different - we generally want to play what the composers wanted, or original recordings did, unless we're specifically doing a reharmonization (though some pop styles do allow for a degree of improvisation as well).

But in Jazz, the whole idea is that lead sheets are vague on purpose. They give you the melody, and a skeletal "suggestive" <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It's always kind of funny when someone says "yeah, the real book is full of mistakes" - well, that's not necessarily true because whoever wrote the chart out wasn't making a note-for-note transcription as a lot of people assume. They may have just played it that way themselves. Kind of a "I play X pretty much like Frank's version, but I like to change up this chord". We didn't get a transcription from Frank's publishing company - we got an under-the-table "Fake Book" thing just was a collection of charts that people had written out the way they played the song - or had decided to perform the song etc. (of course there are bona fide mistakes and misprints too).

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes, this is a great addition. A lot of times a player's <b><u>harmony</u></b> choice is really based on the melody note in combination with the chord symbol.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Thank you for the correction. I think this must have still been in the introduction part of Schenker's <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. To some degree maybe it is, but I think what they found and made a good case for, is that it is flat out wrong in many ways and it was fundamentally misunderstanding things in a dogmatic a priori way (to have the arrogance of renouncing pre-existing practice due to discrepancies with the theory). 
I took music theory 1 and 2 and while it is primarily vertical <b><u>harmony</u></b> based and does not go into much about voice leading at all aside from teaching how to avoid parallels and so on, the general framework for understanding passing tones and nonchord tones suffices to analyze things like Bach chorales in the limited way that it does without raising alarms all over the place, which would inevitably happen if everything were treated as fundamental harmonies. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>They probably only play the minor pentatonic over a major chord when it is on a dominant 7th style <b><u>harmony</u></b>. The mixture of a major and minor 3rd on the dominant has been used since like the renaissance sometimes. Sometimes in jazz they use the minor 3rd as the sharp 9 but really it's like the leading tone alteration simultaneously being there in the lower register and not there in the upper register. That minor third of the dominant leads down to the flat 9 and resolves to the 5th of the tonic when the leading tone resolves up to the tonic and the 7th of the dominant resolves to the 3rd of the tonic. If you play around with that you can understand maybe some ideas of how that works out in a prolonged passage structurally. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You're never going to come up with anything if you're primarily thinking about the emotions that may result. that's not a good mindset to think toward imo.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think tonal stuff with a bit of ambiguity that relies mostly on voice leading is where it's at. Having the functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> to give more direction and character than just early renaissance music, but also allowing lines to go where they may independently as characteristic in traditional "modal" music. That is a lot of what Bach did when he drew from the past in his advanced fugal stuff as he got older. The E major fugue from WTC book 2 is a good example and then of course the Art of Fugue. I view many of the directions lines go and the techniques employed as the contrapuntal equivalent to deceptive cadences by letting it flow on elsewhere and prolonging the statement. 

If you had to make something with primary dependence on diminished chords interesting, I'd say focusing on contrapuntal devices would be your best bet because that would allow more sense to come through that you won't get from just a summation of the vertical <b><u>harmony</u></b> from one time to another. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Music theory is more like a language or a set of formal logic. A lot of theory 1 will only teach how to do very specific things like write chord progressions in 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> that do not violate certain harmonic or voice leading rules, and while it is so limited to really understanding the music of those times, it takes some practice to get good at and you will like what you learn. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Some Bach, particularly the LATER he gets, becomes more modal in ways that evade typical harmonic function. I don't think you can listen to the fugue in E major from WTC II for example and not see the renaissance inspiration, despite the elements of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> it has. It's like a fusion. Other examples are clear in the Art of Fugue and Musical Offering. Even the use of the name ricercar was drawing from the past. However it's later in the classical and romantic era where you have like uber functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, like the Schubert Erlkonig as an example most everyone knows filled with obvious functional cadences to work through distant keys. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hip hop music is usually rudimentary so you can purely be a hack and rely on basic harmonic fundamentals with orchestration of the typical instruments and electronic stuff. Sometimes it can have more funky <b><u>harmony</u></b> but again used in a sampled repeated kind of way 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>The wrong path is for instance creating music that intentionally obscures any meaningful connections and strong patterns of organization on both small and large scales that characterized the success of common practice period favorites. That is the means with which the best art music communicated information. There could be other ways of doing so than the usual manipulation of subjects or themes, but generally modern composers have been bigger on avoiding that than anything. They have not even done a good job trying to create just what sounds good, Shostakovich would work there far beyond most who are liked by academics. 

Established composers, faculty, anything like that, shaming people who would use any of the meaningful principles of common practice art music. There is no grand conspiracy. It only requires snobbery and belief and it formed a circlejerk that largely took over for a while and that is how trends work that control an entire international academy. Almost any of the good music I've ever heard is definitely tonal, and the merits are in some way rooted in common practice convention, even if still very different. I can explain some of why that is so. Western music discovered much of how the mind works and can be exploited when listening to music. It creates an extensive logical system of theory that listeners build up or understand when they study it with how <b><u>harmony</u></b> works. They use the most powerful building blocks, and then use that as the ground work to set expectations and break them in a process that creates a highly ordered, self-referential, and consistent system within a single musical piece. You can still do these things while totally breaking into new territory in other ways, but generally people do not. That whole element of the art is supplanted sometimes by glorified masturbation and pretentious garbage. It's not objective, but if we had the capability to analyze what goes on in the mind with the structure of lines and even had a way to analyze the symmetries, balance, and entropy of a rigorous piece in particular like a beautiful fugue, it will blow out of the water a piece that is arbitrary wondering nonsense done by feel and merely imitating other such colleagues with superficial changes or justifications because the music is so ugly and blind. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Look up the Alan Belkin videos on modal stuff, he gives tips on how to do modal <b><u>harmony</u></b> in pieces that highlights the mode characteristics without making it sound like bad functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You should study voice leading because that is the key to understanding compositional techniques really. Learning the removed from context information about upper structures or nontertian <b><u>harmony</u></b> would be completely useless without learning the treatment of dissonance because that is what makes sense of any of it and allows any of it to be used meaningfully.
So do exercises in what is called species counterpoint. You can find the Gradus Ad Parnassum or study other texts. Beyond that you can apply those concepts of the passing note and prepared dissonances toward analyzing later music and understanding how things are elaborations of more basic voice leading. Schenkerian analysis gets really deep into that. Archive.org is great for pdf scans of many music theory texts in the public domain.
You can learn the most advanced concepts out there and end up sounding basic if you skip over voice leading, while sound application of creative voice leading can make even basic harmonies into a complicated and sophisticated piece. 
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Well you can find all of the music theory pdf's on docslide.net from authors like Schenker, Salzer, Schoenberg, Piston, and others, and then of course purchase the full legal versions instead of illegally downloading the pdf's. You can also go right to archive.org and download full pdf scans of public domain music theory instructional materials.

Watch this guy's entire course, it covers topics from 3 semesters of music theory. It is crucial to work out exercises. You need to be able to harmonize any given lines or just making your own with 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b> according to those rules and get good at that. Then you can use passing tones and elaboration to make Bach style chorales. 
https://www.youtube.com/user/OrchestrationOnline
Of course just as important as the theory fundamentals, you're gonna need to learn principles of orchestration. Now with connects you have doing a business kind of thing, you can hire people to orchestrate your work before the parts are recorded, but it is good to know as much as you can because they should only be fine tuning musical ideas that are already grounded in a good idea of orchestration. 
Most important thing once you learn the principles of common practice tonal music, analyze the composers works that you like. Get out the score and see how they orchestrate things that sound good. See what interesting harmonic movements end up being, or what they really did behind a cool sounding part. 
I would recommend familiarizing yourself with the piano but only enough to know the keyboard and you can use it to input chord voicing and so on into digital audio workstations, or so that you can write something spontaneous at the piano. It has a way of producing ideas that you don't get sitting on a computer in Sibelius or Ableton or whatever. 
Best of luck and feel free to ask followup questions! 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you use negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> as a technique to explore new sounds and progressions that you then decide you like, that is one thing. But I do not think negative harmonic explanations after the fact are very useful. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You need to learn species counterpoint and build from there learning common practice voice leading. It will pay off. Archive.org has free counterpoint texts and you can find Fux for free among others. At the same time a run of the mill <b><u>harmony</u></b> text of today such as Kostka/Payne will help you brush over common practice stuff in general.

2. A common modern music theory textbook. You can buy one used to fill in the gaps in your harmonic knowledge as well as learning the voice leading rules for 4 part writing, nonchord tones, etc. The Kostka-Payne tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> textbook is what my classes used and is one of the most common I think. Hopefully you could find a used one and maybe a new workbook, the exercises do help you. 
3. If you want to study the ultimate consequence of 4 part tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> with independent voices, Bach chorales are where it is at. Bach's son CPE Bach released 371 chorale harmonizations from his father's works. It is reworked slightly so you can play them at the keyboard, and it is simpler to read the modern clefs. 
4. Finally if you want to write in a particular style, find sheet music of the artist(s) you are inspired by and study how they accomplish their voice leading in multiple parts.

This has a lot of <b><u>harmony</u></b> and moving lines over pedal notes. You should seek to understand it. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Roads are sometimes less traveled because people don't know about them. Other times they are less traveled or quickly abandoned because they lead nowhere, they are called "fugue" but lead from the theme to a jumble of failure rather than any discoveries and relations about the subject matter, or even the choice of wise subject matter in the first place. Keep in mind, however, that I'm not being some huge stickler on what exactly a "real fugue" must be. Most of Bach's fugues even violate those things entirely in their own separate ways.   
[Mendelssohn Prelude and Fugue in E minor (fugue)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0fGpUw7Cx4)  
Mendelssohn writes magnificent organ fugues in the Bach sense, they are far better than his romantic music because his undeniable raw genius for counterpoint could shine with functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and smooth voice leading. On the other hand with Brahms I cannot bear to listen to most of his fugues that I've heard but I think he shines in the Intermezzos.   
[Luigi Cherubini - Credo (excerpt)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FATvlSMiTGY)  
This is an absolutely massive fugue undoubtedly pretty unique because it uses an entire double choir and develops the subject and countersubject and inversion over such a huge range of time. Cherubini taught at the Paris conservatory and funny enough, the man who I will link next Anton Reicha would go on to take the role as professor of counterpoint and fugue while Cherubini headed the whole thing, and Cherubini had disapproval of the liberties Reicha took.   
[https://youtu.be/9ZYx\_KHReQU](https://youtu.be/9ZYx_KHReQU)  
[https://youtu.be/EjhDNqvAYXs](https://youtu.be/EjhDNqvAYXs)  
[https://youtu.be/-\_J9drITajY](https://youtu.be/-_J9drITajY)  
Here are some of the fugues from Anton Reicha's 36 fugues, and really you should listen to all of them. It's one of the most remarkable accomplishments of the late classical era, and I think the only one in which the spirit of fugue and classical writing were combined in such an idiosyncratic way. This foreshadowed some of what late Beethoven did decades later in his Great Fugue, despite Beethoven's disapproval of this work. That's not to mention its use of odd meters, polyrhythm, from a one note subject up to 6 different subjects developed together, and subjects repeating at intervals never used before.  
The first fugue I linked, fugue 22, has an exposition repeating at the tritone. The sequential gymnastics to accomplish this smoothly with such an elegant classical tonal theme are remarkable.   
The second fugue I linked, fugue 28, well you just have to listen to it to see how the different parts and interludes come together. When you get to 3:30 you should be surprised by one of the most dramatic harmonic progressions ever written, and then concluding with the simplicity of the major scale and a great IVM7 V7 I.   
The third fugue, fugue 31, is a really conventionally beautiful double fugue that develops the subjects separately and then together very nicely.   
The thing about all of Anton Reicha's fugues is that they are both the most academic/experimental and yet the most practical as pieces; he does not take off his composer's hat to write fugues nor does he start a bad fugue and cheat it as so many scoundrels later on would. If one wouldn't call what he does a fugue that is fair but he retains an integrity and consistency in what he does that is not found if someone does a normal exposition of unremarkable material and then reverts to alberti bass or other complete abandonment of the initial texture without reconciling it.

"The real problem that we face in governing ourselves is that “systems” favor wishful thinking, or us deciding what “should” be true and voting for that instead of a realistic response. Realism requires us to both be aware of our world, and to have a goal other than the immediate, like an aspiration or transcendent purpose. Most people are afraid of that choice because it defines them by quality and ability, and there is no faking it. Good people choose good things in any of a million varieties, while bad people choose infinite variations of the same actual goals, which are always parasitic, perverse or deceptively predatory. These people deny life itself, and rage against it, desiring power so that they can alter in appearance the reality that offends them, and from that, conclude that they were right all along. This giant confirmation bias self-ratifying circle is what lies behind “progress,” which is the idea of pretending that reality is other than it is so that humans feel comfortable because they are no longer challenged to rise above what they are. “Progress” is a path to doom because in the process of denying appearances in reality, it also denies the inherent patterns of reality, and sets itself up for inevitable collision when those manifest in ways that conflict with progressive behavior."

"Our leaders now are degenerate because they are elected, and elections reward showmen and snake oil saleswomen but not realistic leaders, true, but also because they are atrophied. Leadership at this point is a matter of looking over two spreadsheets, a budget and public policy polling. Leaders pick the intersection between profit and popularity, make a speech and hope for the best."

"Leadership is a complex thing. It shows up at every level of humanity and consists of the ability to make decisions intelligently while considering all that needs to be considered. Very few do it well, which is why most of human activity is disorganized and mediocre. To be a good leader, one must be able to balance many competing needs in the mind and to think of the long-term as well as the short-term. Bad leaders create rigid rules that are essentially knee-jerk reactions, but good leaders plan to bring out the best possible outcome and then keep improving on it incrementally through a process the Japanese call kaizen."

"let us combine the best traditions of the past: anarchy, or total independence from the plans of others, and monarchy, or the tradition of picking our best leaders on the basis of their leadership ability alone."

"stop with the politics and economics, and focus on the design of civilization itself. The tool becomes the master when it is not guided by a strong hand. The strong hand we need is not a Fuehrer, but good leadership at every level, even for the average citizen to be morally upright and apply strong cultural principles. Then on top of that, we need the return of kings and a society which emphasizes hierarchy and excellence instead of the participation and equality which lead to degeneration.

Keeping up the grand tradition of inscrutably internally reflexive nomenclature, I suggest we call this “organic reaction,” and that it be known not as a system, but a type of civilization design that leads to better results — “the good, the beautiful and the true” and “the perennial things” (Huxley) or “tradition” (Evola) — so that we as individuals and the society around us are in <b><u>harmony</u></b> working toward a cooperative goal of ever-increasing excellence."

ideally, science should be parallel to religion.

Any sane religion will exist in parallel to science, meaning that the abstract descriptions in that religion will match what science discovers. The problem occurs when religions decide to deny physical reality, or when science decides to politicize itself and create its own competing philosophy to religion.

In the hands of the right interpreter (not you, not yet), there is no scientific “truth”/fact that religion cannot interpret. It is creative mythology to those who understand.

Many of us desire a civilization where philosophy, culture, heritage, language, customs, religion and science are in <b><u>harmony</u></b> toward a distinct and exclusive idea. I do not aspire toward universal, standardizing, averaging, conforming, uniformist religions.

Books I would put there would be:

**20th century <b><u>harmony</u></b>** by Vincent Persichetti
**Structural Functions of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>** by Arnold Schoenberg
**Classical Form** by Caplin
**Gradus ad Parnassum** by Fux
**Preliminary Excises in Counterpoint** by Arnold Schoenberg
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>More than Diatonicism is broken in the 20th century. When you talk about 20th century <b><u>harmony</u></b>, roman numerals are almost never used because **tonality is also gone(for the most part).** 

"it has no effect on the quality or function of the chord" Not true. For example a I6 going to a vi is much more common than a I to vi. What about: I64, which is never notated like this and is generally appears in Figured bass next to a V. Ending a piece cadence on a I64 is actually much more unstable then ending on V. Just try it for yourself, you will see what I am talking about. If you just want to categorize chord functions into three categories and leave it there, then sure, inversions are sometimes unnecesary, but if you want to actually describe the music then you have to talk about inversions. If you see a V42, you expect it to resolve it to a I6 or i6. I don't see how on earth the inversion of a chord is irrelevant to the function of the chord.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>I recommend reading Schoenberg's Essay: Problems with <b><u>Harmony</u></b> were he addresses the Criticism for 12 tone music being disliked by 99.99% of people(I am in the 0.01%, which would be around 700,000 people, so not an exaggeration). 

"There’s too much chaos in today’s contemporary classical and too much order in today’s pop music." Are you aware of any contemporary music after the year 1922? The post war period was especially apollonian, and although I think there is too much order in today's classical music(we could do without minimalism), and especially in pop music: if the music is ever going to "settle into an intuitive groove..." I think it needs to stay in the path it is currently in: less pre-composition. It needs to get further away from the style of Serialism and Minimalism, and go back into more of the style of the Second Viennese School as far as order in *form* is.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"and a good deal of contemporary classical"

Sure, if you are talking about the Contemporary Classical that isn't actually classical music and is just pop music with a string section and a piano then that is true. But real Contemporary Classical is either not tonal at all or would never be analyzed the same way as Jazz.

"common practice has the 7 imply b7 unless explicitly stated otherwise" in common practice <b><u>harmony</u></b>, the amount of extensions are diatonic.

Is it the specific scale degrees common to the Tonic, Dom, and Sub classifications that make that work? If so, is it the 4th or 6th that matters for Subdominant functions?"
Because when you take a collection of pitches with proportional relations in their frequencies, they will exhibit what we call tonality.
Taking random pitches or pitches with very obscured relations will create non-functional (and unenjoyable for the most people music - check Stockhausen, Boulez  and friends).

"And 2: How does that apply to minor and other modes? Leading to: How do you actually use minor and other modes, and make it harmonically functional? Do you just have to use the same chords, and make it more major? If so when? IOW why does minor stress a major dominant function, but not tonic or subdominant functions? Or do you focus on what is most 'dorian-like' or what-not for the mode - and if so, what IS most distinctive for minor and other modes?"
At this point I think that you need to check the reddit FAQ or wikipedia. There are excellent articles.
You problems come from overthinking and not understanding the basics of music theory. You have probably skipped them and went directly to more advanced stuff.
You can't expect harmonic functions in modes when the optimal consonance exists only in 1 of the modes. 
In the major - it's the Ionian mode; Harmonic minor, Harmonic major, Melodic minor, Double harmonic scale, Neapolitan Major and Neapolitan Minor also have semi-useful harmonic functions. But all are worse than Ionian (but better than the countless modes).
So, learn the basics for wikipedia or the reddit wiki, then read this, if you have more questions
https://www.amazon.com/Genesis-Music-Account-Creative-Fulfillments/dp/030680106X
this is also good

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, I misread your question. Don't expect too much microtonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> from popular music. I don't think that Jacob uses microtonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> either unless you count the pure vocal harmonies as microtonal.
For microtonal <b><u>harmony</u></b>, check Ben Johnston, Lou Harrison, Boulez, Thomas Ades etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, modes are just rotation of a pattern. 
Tetrachords are "usually" 4 notes that divide a P4 intervals. You can stack 2 tetrachord and place a whole tone interval between them and construct a good scale. The Melakarta system of Indian music is based on this.
"Good" tetrachords  for constructing scales (imo) are (in integer notation): 0235 (Dorian), 0245 (Ionian), 0135 (Phrygian), 0145 (exotic/Arabic/Agni), 0125 (Indu from Indian theory sounds better than " Minor Third Tetracluster.2"), 0345 (Ritu/ Minor Third Tetracluster.1).  The last two are good for blues or Indian music, 0145 is good for flamenco or arabic style music.
These can be placed both as lower and upper tetrachord.
Some tetrachords are division of other interval - the Indians use 0126, 0136, 0146, 0236, 0246(used in Lydian and whole tone scale by Western people), 0346 as lower tetrachords and these are division of a tritone in 12et.
The lower tetrachords gives the main flavour of the scale. The upper tetrachord gives us colouration.

Beethoven named a piece in Lydian, so you can probably write "Lydian" in the title... But most composers don't like to reveal their "secret" scales. Lydian is all over the place in Hollywood music (older composers). Lydian b3 (0236) is favoured by Danny Elfman.

"Also just like each degree of the major scale has a mode each mode has its own scale degrees with their own modes as well?" - Yes, but the modes share scales and usually you need to write in a particular way to avoid slipping in the most stable harmonically mode (Natural major,  Melodic minor, Harmonic minor etc). There were examples for voicings in one of my old <b><u>harmony</u></b> books suggesting voice leading for some of the popular modes, so you don't go into major or something else.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You can find many out of print scans of older music books, if you search archive.org . Some of them are written by famous composers or theorists.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, there are probably an infinite ways to arrange any piece of music. What Ravel did was according to his musical liking... Even if a genre arrangement let's say a jazz or metal version of a particular piece, there are probably still hundreds of possibilities that can sound good. Comparing to Ravel is pointless unless you want to imitate his style from this particular period and mood.

To the OP:

Buy or download (out of copyright stuff from archive.org, there are also counterpoint, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and form books) an orchestration book. You will learn more about the instruments and how to write for them. 

Scores for studying:

Basic stuff like Mendelssohn, Bizet (Carmen), Tchaikovsky, Mozart.

Later:

Wagner

Holst- The Planets

Stravinsky - Firebird, Petrushka, Rite of Spring

Dukas: Sorcerers Apprentice

Copeland: Appalachian Spring

Ravel - Bolero; Daphnis and Chloe

Mahler -  Das Lied Von Der Erde

Berlioz -  Symphonie Fantastique

John Adams - Harmonielehre

Debussy - The Sea

Rimsky-Korsakov:  Scheherazade


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You generally want to tune the instruments, so they sound "smooth" with the notes you play.

 Really complex timbres (like the overmodulated FM dubstep growls) DON'T work with scales and tuning systems based on the simple ways strings vibrate (which created the Western musical system).

Adding <b><u>harmony</u></b> and counterpoint  further limits the choice - you have to distort the intervals to remain in a small system or add more and more slightly different notes.

Arabic music and Gamelan don't actually exist in 12et. 

For simple pop/electornic/rock music that doesn't modulate, all the various microtonal tunings are perfectly fine.

For something like Wagner - I doubt you want to notate a piece with 50+ different pitches..
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Many jazz composers and arrangers were influenced by European music. There is no such thing as "jazz" <b><u>harmony</u></b> and "classical" <b><u>harmony</u></b>. The harmonic choices are dictated by the composer/ player's personal preferences (unless you are intentionally making a pastiche).

That's why it's good to have broader music horizons.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Guys, what's up  with these "negative" <b><u>harmony</u></b> topics and retarded Collier threads.

Read the book "Introduction to post-tonal theory" by J. Straus - it's one of the recommended here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/wiki/faq/core/go_deeper

Go to the chapter dealing with inversional axes and symmetries and stop spamming reddit. 

(I doubt that Collier and his jazz friendos have read any academical post-tonal theory; there is no need to invent new names for old concept and spreading misinformation).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you have a phone with big screen, e-book or tablet, just download some out of copyright music theory books like this one.

http://imslp.org/wiki/Guide_to_the_Practical_Study_of_<b><u>Harmony</u></b>_(Tchaikovsky%2C_Pyotr)

Use words like <b><u>harmony</u></b>, counterpoint, form, orchestration etc and search archive.org and imslp.
Also, wikipedia is good - it has many music theory articles.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's called symmetry and you should have already studied some basics during your geometry classes in school.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry

The wiki article mentions Bartok and Berg. You can listen to their music to hear different uses of the so called negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>. In the Straus books you will find some examples and 12 axes of inversion (reflection in mathematical jargon), one of which is the one used in Collier's video.

Maybe read http://solomonsmusic.net/diss.htm and Howard Hanson's <b><u>harmony</u></b> book (public domain - proto post-tonal theory, he talks about "involution")
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b><br>That webpage is completely useless - people in the past used different meantone and well temperaments, which means that some tonalities were out of tune, but each key sounded different and more in-tune than the equal 12.  You need microtonal synths for this. Serum, Omnisphere and some others can be retuned in such way. 

Equal 12 came in fashion because of composers like Liszt, Wagner etc that would modulate between unrelated keys in their compositions, but the orchestral players of course would re-intonate the notes in a musical way, which is impossible on the piano and requires electronic piano with a switch button between let's say Cmaj and Gbmaj or else it will sound out of tune, if you try playing pure <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"Negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>" is axis inversion practiced by people like Bartok, Carter, Berg etc. It's already described in the post-tonal analysis theory books and academic articles. Check Straus's book, probably it's also mentioned in the other good textbooks.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, the musical set theory is criticized too. The transformational theory is criticized too. I wouldn't care too much about what is popular and criticized, you will find good ideas in all of these books.

There is also this:
https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Post-Tonal-Miguel-Roig-Francoli-<b><u>Harmony</u></b>/dp/007293624X

Straus is good, but dry and academic. I wouldn't say that any of these books will give complete undertanding of what is going on.

I suggest going to the amazon pages and checking the table of content, you will see that some of them feature topics not represented in the others (some interesting techniques are also just mentioned).

Harmonic Materials of Modern Music by Howard Hanson is out of copyright and already scanned, it's proto-post tonal theory. I suggest checking it.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's based on fourths, I think. 

I had to write a pastiche in EDM style recently for a client. I checked the original song. Obviously the producers didn't have a clue about traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody playing and were just jamming - the end result was the typical pop song that is hard to analyze - major and minor scales mixtures, borrowing chords etc.

After thinking about this type of <b><u>harmony</u></b>, my ideas were: it's a reflections of the normal notes on some axis ("negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>") or it's circle of fourths <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

There were no modulations or outside the key /foreign/weird chords and notes.

So ,(imo) these type of chord changes are most likely based on fourths,
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; There were musical theories way-way before Bach and Mozart in the Western culture. Consult any "History of Western/Medieval/Renaissance/Baroque music theory" type book. And plenty of theory during their day.

And it wasn't speculative at all. And it was also pretty narrow to the point that when Western people encountered the music of other cultures, they were considered primitive, because they didn't develop <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but other elements of music, but scholars didn't understood that.

Even now the standard textbooks are useless in teaching anything other than 18th century practices. Let's not also forget the limitations of the staff notation and how anything more complex becomes almost unreadable.



</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, there is a difference between the craft of music composition/playing and the science of music - do you really want to know math, physics, psychology just to play an instrument, make "beats" or sing pop songs?

You probably don't need such "dry" theories even for serious "art" music.

If you want to know why things work - check books like "The Science Of Musical Sound", Mathematical Theory of Music or Music: A Mathematical Offering.

If you want to expand your horizons without going in-depth into academic language and theories - check A Geometry of Music: <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and Counterpoint in the Extended Common Practice.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The Cambridge companion to "X composer" and similar titles.

I wouldn't call this type of music French at all - there is nothing "French" in using pentatonic, modal, medieval, octatonic, medieval, Asian/ Wagnerian influences.

Exoticism/orientalism was very  popular in France at some point - many famous and now forgotten composers used to compose pseudo-asiatic/exotic music.

Also, modern <b><u>harmony</u></b>? What is this? You are free to compose in any harmonic way - from drones to clusters. There is no school of modern <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

If we judge the popular music, you should stick to the resources of the diatonic scale...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I wouldn't trust too much this book. There were several jazz "theories" employed last century and before them - no specific theory/traditional western music theory/adapted  African practices + some jazz musicians (mainly drummers went to Africa to study traditional music).

Maybe look for Gernhard Kubik's "Africa and the blues" (he also has 2 volumes of African music theory).

19-20th century <b><u>harmony</u></b> books already cover extended/chromatic <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"I really think that humanity deserves a better system for annotating musical <b><u>harmony</u></b>."

" For me, musical <b><u>harmony</u></b> is about diatonic chords and it should be annotated relative to them"

Well, musical <b><u>harmony</u></b> is not about diatonic chords only (and is also not only about Vinnese classicism or romantic period etc ).

For a scientific theory you need something that can be proved, is based on universal principles etc.

That's why the newest musical theory trends like the american set theory and neo-riemannian/transformation theory are based on mathematics, not on stylistic conventions based. 

 Also, naming a chord with a roman numeral by itself doesn't reveal anything about the way this chord  works and its relationships. Imo, the Riemannian system is better in functional analysis of traditional classical music, but is also more complex and harder to learn (and also just as useless for 20-21st century avantgarde music ).

I read your <b><u>harmony</u></b> book, HrvojeS - it is very good for beginners, because it is clearly written, but most of it deals with elementary music knowledge like notation etc which has no place in a <b><u>harmony</u></b> treatise (because when you start reading about musical <b><u>harmony</u></b> you should already know elementary music theory) and is incomplete. Someone can probably write thousands of pages on just <b><u>harmony</u></b> strategies and practices without mentioning elementary stuff like notation.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think that your book is somewhat lacking in the psychological side of <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 

Maybe this is a good compliment to it.

If you want to learn more about melody, study some melodies that you like.

Studying <b><u>harmony</u></b> won't make you a good melodist. You can even skip <b><u>harmony</u></b> completely, if you focus on rhythm, counterpoint (study actual pieces of contrapuntal music, not textbooks with generic advices) and melody practice, because good <b><u>harmony</u></b> will come naturally from your voice leading.

Study scales, rhythms, analyse the way composers structure their rhythmical gestures.

Check these short books.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If <b><u>harmony</u></b> "  sounds terrible on its own" you will have a hard time to convince anyone that it is "really really good when it's put into a unified piece".

Intervals that are used in the popular music already sound good on their own.

Maybe  listen to some 20th century 12tone/dissonant music - "bad sounding input" like minor seconds, diminished fifths etc =&gt; "bad" output (unless you are fan of horror genre, of course). 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LACCAF04wSs
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Analyse some film music. I doubt that in isolation the music will convey any of these emotions. It's all about the scene and without the picture or lyrics you will probably fail to invoke such feelings. You can probably use the same <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody for a love, battle/ heroic, happy whatever mood.

Instrumentation is more important in this case - distorted guitars or forissimo brass will sound more powerful/angry lute than a flute or solo violin etc.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I hope you understand that counterpoint is pretty much style based and the rules aren't "laws". If you know <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you should be able to make counterpoint. Also, learning Bach's style won't make you to compose like Palestrina, Beethoven, Wagner, Hindemith or Stravinsky, or the medieval composers, or gospel hymns. That's why, imo, books dissecting a particular style (Jeppesen ) are more useful than some general observations that don't work at in other styles.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br><b><u>Harmony</u></b> is congruence between frequencies (2:1 = octave, 3/2 = fifths; 4:5:6 will be pure major chord). 

Melody is a sequence of frequencies. If you add more tones to it, your melody becomes <b><u>harmony</u></b>. The more complex the ratios of the added frequencies, the more dissonant the <b><u>harmony</u></b> will be. 


</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b><br>I would stay away from any "Chord progressions". The reason why pop music music got so dumb is because some people decided that music making means looping 4 bars of a chord changes and all the notes derived from the chords.

My advice: 

First make a rhythm/pulse. Then assign this pattern to various percussion instruments until you have a nice beat/groove. Then use this rhythm and make a bassline (if your rhythm is 2321, bass should be harmonious to it - let's say you can divide your rhythm pulses 1 1 2 1 2 1 or combine them 5 3). Same can be done to melody notes and background <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Choose a scale and distribute the rhythm to various pitches for the bass/melody/<b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Then compose some variations of the melody, rhythms until you have a complete 2-4 minute song. Don't loop the same shit for 2-4 minutes!!! Noone buys generic music and you will become just another failed producer.

Knowing the genre conventions will help, consult various wiki/encyclopedia articles on specific genres - typical instrumention, history etc
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There is no best and it depends on what you want to compose/learn/what you already know. See the free e-books by Alan Belkin and his youtube <b><u>harmony</u></b> course. Complete musician - Laitz is good course too.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b><br>OP asked about producers that are objectively great in all aspects - not only technical - like recording, mixing, mastering, but also compositional and performance aspects.  We are not talking about what/me/anyone likes or not. Is it hard to understand? There is nothing subjective in judging the quality of the music. If you are conditioned to like certain styles, OK - we are not talking at all about personal preferences.  

Music has melody, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, rhythm, ornamentations/expressive articulations etc.

 Well produced (recorded, mixed, mastered) with low musical content (predictable/ boring/cliche) = garbage (Noisia - or at least of their recent output)

Well composed music with low quality production = garbage. 

Well composed music with pefect production = good. 

Bad production with bad musical content = garbage. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Man, listeners don't care about yours or traditional theories... You can invent whatever justification for your style. Traditional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is also just a style. There is no need for any "circle" or "function of" anything. The sad part is that people think of all this stuff as rules.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br><b><u>Harmony</u></b> is (poly)rhythm, man...

The Jacob guy is definitely a guy that knows the power of good marketing. I don't like his music and he is certainly overhyped.
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b><br>Collier in his viral video was talking about specific axis inversion (probably read about it in the Levy's book).

All this is incredibly awkwardly explained and the whole "negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> misinformation/Jacob is amazing" campaign is really silly.

First: learn who is Bartok

 Second, try to remember when you learned about the symmetry operations in school - reflections, rotation, translation etc.

Third, there is a university level textbook on modern music theory:

https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Post-Tonal-Theory-Fourth-Joseph/dp/0393938832

Go to the chapter describing various axis inversions and you will learn more than the "genius" Jacob will probably ever learn.

This is also good introduction to symmetry in music and Bartok's music :

http://solomonsmusic.net/diss.htm#Abstract

The reason why "negative" <b><u>harmony</u></b> sounds 90 % of the time like shit is because when you look in funhouse mirror, your figure is distorted.

"Tonality" (modern western music system) is based on the modes string vibrate (because that's what ancient musician/physicists used to investigate) and the minima of dissonance which isn't exactly governed by the partials of the string (because there is inharmonicity making the natural timbres sound the way they sound, not like generic synth patch - which needs detuning and careful envelope sculpting to resemble realistic string, brass, woodwind timbre), and some mathematical patterns, and the limitations of our instrument design (it is known that 19 and 31 note scales sound more musical, but these were unpractical before the modern "hexagonal" or whatever shape they are made isomorphic keyboards/midi controllers).

Some cultures like the Indonesian people used completely different type of instruments, with different modes of vibration and dissonance minima curves, developing completely different "tonality" (heard in the gamelan music). 
</p></li><li><p><b>microtonal</b><br>Wow, it sounds beyond terrible on his piano and synths... How audible and important is the 13th harmonic when using normal timbres like strings, piano etc? Not very much. It requires careful synthesizing of a spectrum with inharmonic series featuring audible tridecimal ratios in it to have something workable for <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 

Arabs use the 13th harmonic with normal timbres, but for melodies. Microtonalists have a bad image, because of people like K. Gann. Imagine playing Bach on a kazoo or something similar. It just doesn't works (well, it works, but sounds like a parody).
</p></li><li><p><b>microtonal</b><br>Well, I wanted to say that in oriental music you can hear this harmonic (I lived near the border of Turkey in the and have listened a lot of this type of music) in melodic context. It just doesn't work in the way Gann tries to use it as a <b><u>harmony</u></b> on the piano (there was an online app that was plotting the dissonance curves of a piano using the data from some book on acoustics; depending on the playing technique, the amplitude and the frequencis, some 7-limit ratios were fine according to the graph, but using 11 and 13 limit ratios is way off).

I know that people have built 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcSod-sj2CE

 instruments for a  specific tuning and I've detuned in the past an FM synthesizer to a 17 ET for neutral chords that don't clash violently.

You may enjoy this music, because you are already into modern music (I've seen your post in the past in the classical music or composer subreddit), but for many people I know even simple jazz chords sound like dissonance. 

"Who even knows they exist?" 

Really?

I don't want to write an essay about the image of contemporary art/experimental music here. Microtonal music is not something new or that obscure.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't know much about the "blurred or rotten" 20th century music theory - maybe he was talking about whatever was popular once upon a time - Schenker, traditional Riemannian <b><u>harmony</u></b>, Schoenberg's system,  Hindemith, the various 12 tone and serial systems - Schoenberg, Krenek, Perle etc. No idea. But probably all these are more like "artistic" methods and not a real scientific theories... 

Well, set theory describes stuff, but in a combinatorial way - you enumerate chords, check whether certain structures exist etc, but you can't create a real music theory or explain anything. When you do a set analysis of a work, it is likely to miss some essential components when using a mechanical protocol for dissecting the music (it is possible that composer was using some kind of compositional logic that is beyond the scope of the set theory).

Gesture would be a transformation of pitches in this case, but you can use transformations in the rhythm, form, orchestration etc. The Mazzola guy has developed a basic theory of gestures and performance in his book.

 I have not read Lewin's books, but I have heard that newer books by Tymoczko, Richard Cohn or Steven Rings (this one won a music theory award) are way more accessible. Also this should be mentioned: Chromatic Transformations in Nineteenth-Century Music by David Kopp.

If you search youtube, you can find lectures by Cohn, Tymoczko or  Mazzola.




</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Only the first few harmonics have any influence on the what type of <b><u>harmony</u></b> can sound good (because they are actually audible). So, using natural chordophones or aerophones, we are stuck with the diatonic or close to diatonic scales - this means 12et, 19et, 22et, 31et etc.

Arabs use such instruments and microtonal scales, but their music can't be harmonised in thirds (unless you like  car horns music).

Idiophones and membranophones are more complex and traditional African, Indonesian, East Asian music uses more complex sounding scales, but I have never heard of any harmonic systems developed (in theory it should be possible - it would probably sound like  somewhat jazzy-ethno).

Using synthesizers, there are no limits. You can synthesize any timbre and use any scale.

But the more complex the scale, the more dissonant it becomes.

Considering that dubstep is very popular (music with almost no melodies that uses inharmonic FM timbres) it is probably possible to make pop music with non-western sounding material, but I don't know about <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Debussy would have loved this piano.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Google limited transposition sets... (stuff like whole tone scale, augmented chords and scales, messiaen modes). In prime number ETs like 19 and 31 which are better than 12 in terms of intonation of the Western <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you don't get such limited transposition sets, because there are no excessive symmetries like in 12ET.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You are misusing and misunderstanding "functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>". I suggest reading more about Riemann/Oettingen's theories... 

Undertone series doesn't exist, but the notes of the undertone series are  also a dissonance minima, because they are inversions of the harmonic series - see the articles of Sethares or his Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum book.

If you are interested to the newest hot theories that are more capable in explaining music theory, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_theory
</p></li><li><p><b>Psychic</b><br>Subjective criteria. 

That's why real musical critics use objective musical criteria to judge - tempo, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, rhythm, lyrical content, orchestration etc etc. It doesn't matter how much the population is brainwashed by the half naked singers and the marketing campaigns behind them, real musical analysis can't lie (of course, pop music critics don't make real analysis of the music - they write some bs. - I've seen laughable essays on typical pop songs aka 4 chords and pentatonic scale - where the critics is trying to avoid writing anything revealing how bad the songwriting is actually - this doesn't stop all the teens to be in love with that garbage ).

These idiot/dummies books are not bad, but they are also not great.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, "classical music" doesn't mean like anything and there are no essential composers unless you like someone so much that you want to start composing pastiches in his style.

In general, you can learn composing and playing - the difference between more high styles and low (pop, dance, folk) styles in the complexity and ambition of the compositions.

Learn <b><u>harmony</u></b>, counterpoint, rhythms and form, scales... and just compose.

</p></li><li><p><b>Soulnexus</b><br>There is no conspiracy. You can't just find friends with musical instruments and play  using instruments from different cultures, regions and time periods, because of tuning issues (base pitch differences and individual note intonation). There is a reason why pitch standards became a thing in Western Europe. 

Modern authentic Baroque and Classical recordings use way lower or higher bases for tuning and reconstructed instruments (also the intonation is different).


  Commercial library sounbanks that are used all over the TV, cinema and radio music edit each individual sample, so it won't clash with the standards - the lazy developers still make mistakes and there are sounbanks that cost around 1000 USD with unplayable notes that will clash with the <b><u>harmony</u></b> - many real instruments like strings, brass and woodwinds don't really play in tune unlike stuff like pianos and digital keyboards/ computer instruments.

440 hz for A is arbitrary and anyone can make custom instruments or retune existing instruments. Even A is arbitrary. There are hundreds of  Oriental and African scales that don't even need this pitch and will use microtone way flatter or sharper.

432 comes from A - taking it as 27/16 ratio to the power of 2 sequence of octaves. The thing is that the pure A in JI is not 432 hz, if we take the same octave sequence. It's 5/3, so 426.666666666666666666666666666666666 etc hz - not an integer. 


Of course, now I we retune on the fly and use unlimited number of pitches per octave and any base frequency, if you use dsp and midi technology, but all this stuff is somewhat technical and not well supported...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It doesn't sound sad. It is associated with sadness especially in <b><u>harmony</u></b>, because pure (JI or close to JI) major thirds are more consonant. There are tons of happy songs in minor mode.

 See Pharell Williams - Happy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Sxv-sUYtM

(Imo, major third in 12ET is out of tune and sounds grotesque or cheesy timbre depending)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br><b><u>Harmony</u></b> serves as an accompaniment. In non-Western music, you have arpeggios, static drone notes or scale motives instead of chords for the accompaniment, because chords will usually clash dissonantly (especially in oriental music).
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b><br><b><u>Harmony</u></b> means simultaneous pitches that blend (that's why dissonant chords aren't <b><u>harmony</u></b>). So bass + melody several octaves above the bass is not a real <b><u>harmony</u></b> - they don't blend - they sound like distinctive pitches.

Arpeggios and similar motives aren't <b><u>harmony</u></b>, if we have to be serious about the definitions, but they are also a form of accompaniment just like the chords are.

To the OP:

you don't need no chords to make music. The most basic requirement is rhythm.

Then comes melody = rhythm + different pitches. Basslines are type of simple melody.

Stay away from Salzer and other schenkerian guys - if you are looking for a real abstract framework, there is the mathematical music theory (see David Lewin and  Guerino Mazzola, or Lerdahl: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Constraints_on_Compositional_Systems  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_theory_of_tonal_music ), but it is way-way beyond what you will probably need unless you want to write musical composition software and similar.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Grab some old Russian folk songs anthologies (it is funny that he was saying that he composed the melodies until the actual source books were identified by the critics), add dissonant <b><u>harmony</u></b> and some good orchestration. Octatonic scale was a big hit back in the day not only in Russia (made popular by Stravinsky's teacher R. Korsakov), but in other countries like France.

 Pesichetti is a book on <b><u>harmony</u></b> and most of the his music examples sound like s\*\*t when you actually play them which is not a good sign. The truth is that we can't play random secundal <b><u>harmony</u></b> and similar, and expect to sound good.

I think that it can be heard in film music too - John Williams brutally copy-pasted some Brahms passages in some films.

The problem with harmonic major and minor in melodies is that the upper tetrachord sounds exotic/Egyptian/Indian or whatever, and its rarely used for melody, mostly for <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I can't think of a single Western pop song using it in the melody.

And people don't want aural wallpaper - they want intelligeble melodies and rhythms (<b><u>harmony</u></b> is not even needed to create good music - check any Asian classical music where they use ostinatos and heterophony, because chords don't work with their tuning system). Even the slow, consonant tonal music is usually rejected by young people - they want more energy/ liveliness, not church style borefest.

Avantgarde sounding stuff found its place in popular culture as a tool for invoking horror. I've seen many discussions like the one you created - check the talkclassical forum - and defenders of atonal clearly are musicians with developed ears that are bored out of traditional Western music; or some people with weird taste. I'm sorry, but this type of experimental music killed popularity of concert hall music.

I think that the next "great" classical composer will have more common with J. Strauss (the guy who created some silly, but beatiful dance music) than with the avantgardists (considering how popular are the various dance genres all over the world this century).

Every near even or maximally even scale in any edo will resemble or have in its structure some other smaller edo along with various useful properties like transpositional symmetries (like the  circle of fifths). 

The most interesting thing to me is that there are scales that are not generated by a single interval in one system, but they are in another (like the double harmonic in 12 - its very close to the neutral third heptatonic scale in 10 edo; I've also noticed that maqam Rast - the most popular arabic scale (which is basically the same thing as the scale from 10 edo) - is a permutation (the same way melodic minor is a permutation of the the diatonic scale) of the 24 edo's neutral third heptatonic scale; but Rast (starting from its "dorian mode") is also the 7note scale generated in 22 edo by interval of 163 cents. )

I've played one melody (using Kontakt retuning scripts) recently in "12 edo dorian", "arabic dorian in 24" and "arabic dorian in 22" and the difference is pretty subtle. The first one can be harmonized the best, but it lacks something in the melodic intervals, the second sounds like crap in <b><u>harmony</u></b> (but most interesting for melody), the third is a compromise between <b><u>harmony</u></b> (having 4 consonant triadic chords - on D, E,F,G) and some interesting melodic intervals giving some kind of lightness (or maybe it was just the flute timbre).

Like wholetone scale - which exists in any edo x 6 = 6, 12 (Western music), 18 etc. Pitch classes of equal edos serve as generators of scales with somewhat regular structure that resembles them. The size of a fifth/fourth in 12 edo is 700/500 cents. If we look the sizes of 7 edo, we see sizes around 685/514. Using slightly larger or smaller size than these as a generator and octave period will give us a 7-note scale with different step sizes (diatonic is aba a aba - the generator is a "fifth" that has to be bigger than 685 cents or reverse - using a fifht smaller than 685 gives us the anti-diatonic scale where big and small intevals are swapped - it's known as one of the gamelan scales, but it does not work with normal Western instruments - it will sound out of tune just like major/related modes will be out of tune on gamelan ) . You can see different generators and related information in the Farey sequence or Stern-Brocot tree. Check also the symmetry groups of various 2d figures. (Using the other pitch classes out of 7-edo as generators can give us other nice scales - like "porkupine" (this one has major and minor triads) or "arabic in 24 ET" - this one is good for melodies, but sucks for <b><u>harmony</u></b> )

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The thing is that <b><u>harmony</u></b> being a recent inventions is a myth. Ancient people playing on primitive "lyras" and "kitharas" and similar thousands of years ago were 100 % using chords. It's hard not to strum chords on such intruments.

But systematic teaching and theory of <b><u>harmony</u></b> were developed relatively recently.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, "functional" <b><u>harmony</u></b> descended from triadic based musical styles (in Italy?) (which were first closer to polyphony, then got dumbed down)... 

Of course, there is no reason <b><u>harmony</u></b> to be "functional" (in the sense of Ramue/Riemann sense).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In 10 years noone will remember this meme... Advanced books on 20th century <b><u>harmony</u></b> already have more than enough information on various forms of reflection with examples from Bartok.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Study existing composition and write imitations... Add baroque ornamentation. You are done. Counterpoint and <b><u>harmony</u></b> won't teach you as much as actually composing pastiches of existing music (plus real music can break the rules of music theory).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you are into modern music theory, there are many other circles exploring the symmetries of 12ET. All this stuff is generally based on the symmetries of 12-gon.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecagon#/media/File:Regular_dodecagon_symmetries4.png
That's why the tonal regions in Bartok for example have little to do with 18th century practice.
Introduction to post-tonal theory - J. Straus is often recommended on this subreddit. It is good for introduction to "serious" modern music theory. Too bad the followers of various  memes like "negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>" haven't read this or other similar books.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"Functional" means following Rameu  and Riemann's  theories based on Tonic and Dominant, and Subdominant chords/functions. 
VII-I exists in other heptatonic scales in 12ET too (and any scale bigger than 7 that contains them as subsets, of course). Harmonic Major is the most famous and used by romantic composers like Brahms and others; the other heptatonic scales have more irregular structure.
The thing is that these T/S/D "functions" and heptatonic scales are not the only thing that works musically. Let's say that these musical structures (tonalities/modalities or whatever they should be called) are described with other "functions". The thing is that unless you want to study or compose modern music, all this stuff is useless and it's not taught in the schools at all. 
It is sad that so many people on this forum are so ignorant about 19-20-21st century music.
Still, the defining characteristic of modal music is the melody structure and <b><u>harmony</u></b> requires specific voice leading, so you don't arrive in other mode. Studying a good deal of modal melodies (preferably in a contrapuntal context) can teach more than enough anyone wanting to learn about composing modal melodies.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Even the names you used for pitch classes are based on triadic "third" based harmonies and heptatonic scales.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> based on fourths or fifths can be simplified to the ancient greek tetrachord - CFG, which we can permutate to sus4 or sus2 chord. This is not a very useful scale, so we can evolve it to a black keys pentonic scale and it will be good for 2 part (and by 2 part I mean 2 different pitch classes) counterpoint. In medieval music you have CGC chords as ending or beginning. Adding more notes to the chord won't make for a very good polyphonic style, if you want contrary melodies. For this you need heptatonic scales and chords that are near major or minor triads, but consonant, so that's why arabic scales fail, if you want consonant music.

For tetrads (think jazz or late romantic music) you need something like the half-diminished chord (and it's permutations - minor seventh and dominant) and 13 note scale. 12 is near 13, so we can kind of imitate tetrad counterpoint and smooth voice leading using the whole chromatic scale (22 or 27 division of octave would be better for more in-tune seventh chords and scales, based on them).

In jazz or modernist music we can hear voicings and chord progressions based on seconds and thirds(because pianists are not octopuses, so they can't actually play gigantic stacked chords based on some big intervals) or clusters. These are not very good not only from harmonic perspective, but for optimal voice leading (from classical standpoint) and loopy chord progressions, you need some kind of gigantic scales with many notes per octave.

Of course, it's not like jazz people care about counterpoint rules, right (especially for a system that doesn't exist as a real theory)?

Still, I find medieval type counterpoint interesting. Renaissance too. These can be extended to bigger systems (Medieval can work for arabic type or of course, diatonic music; Renaissance naturally in bigger meantone systems - see Gesualdo, Vicentino or similar old composers for non-standard progressions that are not even possible in 12ET, because they had split keys harpischords or organs), if you want more interesting melody and chord patterns, but we have to break the rules and allow parallel voice leading from time to time.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It changes everything from acoustic standpoint, but theory considering every possible permutations of a chord would be too complex to formulate, teach and learn.

That's why chords in Western music are equivalent under cyclic permutation (it's called inversion in music theory). If you get a <b><u>harmony</u></b> book, you will learn many typical chord progressions involving inverted chords along root position triads in all kinds of music. Alternatively, study music scores.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"a lot of the most complicated and impressive songs ever written, are almost painful to listen to" - not really. 

The trick is to create something complex (not complicated) from many simple elements. Being slightly original doesn't make the cut, so while Beatles or similar stand above the typical rock band, they are not in the same league as the greatest composers. 

That's why Western classical music is still considered the greatest musical achievement: not only is listenable, but there are very deep compositions on structural, motivic, harmonic, melodic level, timbral (rich orchestration). The only lackluster thing is the rhythm, if someone is looking for modern dance type music with percussion.

Non-Western classical music doesn't support <b><u>harmony</u></b> (or it's such a pain in the ass to compose and perform in gigantic pitch systems, so noone developed such thing in the past - I see that modern composers are experimenting with chords in Arabic tuning etc ), so while has more developed rhythmical and melodic practices, it's still more simplistic than older art Western music.

20-21st century experimental composers are from the noisy/original crowd that makes complicated, but not complex music (it's just hard to listen to something too dissonant or atonal).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Dude, the theory of functions was invented in 1893... I suggest not brainwashing yourself too much with music theory, because you may start hearing stuff that is not there... (There was one good German textbook focusing just on the stylistic traits -in terms of <b><u>harmony</u></b> practices - of each period without too much modern meta-nonsense.)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>why is x+1&gt;x ? You misunderstood me. The masterwork compositions feature good melodies and rhythms even if they are not focused just on them. Of course, they will be considered more complex than works without any <b><u>harmony</u></b>...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Because you can replicate the Indian style, but add <b><u>harmony</u></b> on top. There are few composers last century doing oriental inspired stuff like that...  
Btw, Indian music is hardly microtonal in some different way than Western music (because real acoustic instruments can't actually be tuned to equal temperament, it's mainly in the electronic music and theoretical framework)  - it's the same 5-limit perspective like Western music. They add more ornamentation and pitch bending, that's it. Arabic, gamelan and some African styles are way more "microtonal".   

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It didn't evolve into <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  There is also no such thing as a single theory of counterpoint (or <b><u>harmony</u></b>). Modern theories of <b><u>harmony</u></b> as taugh in many schools are also way different than theories back in Bach's time for example - they would have laughed, if you talk about roman numerals, functions, dominants, subdominants etc.

All these theory are also somewhat dependant on tuning  systems and instruments' construction; there are rules and even notation that are based on stuff that doesn't even exist in 12edo...

In modern music theory, the 12 notes per octave are associated with the symmetries of regular 12gon, you can find all reflection, translation symmetries, "negative" <b><u>harmony</u></b> (lmfao at uneducated jazz people), circle of fifths etc in it...  


About the whole substitution business - we are free to play anything after anything and over anything; people obsessed over mysterious "substitutions" and formulas overcomplicate very intutive theory...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's all about the timbre and even well balanced final textures may sound crappy without studio magic like EQ, reverb and compression...  


Many heavy modulated FM timbres will also not work at all in <b><u>harmony</u></b> (Western <b><u>harmony</u></b>)...
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"In other words, TONALity exists where FUNCTIONal <b><u>harmony</u></b> underlines the tonic, involving a system of tonic chords, pre-dominant, and dominant functions."

If you are interested in this stuff, you will have to read the books by Rameu and Riemann - they can be found online and are out of copyright.  Btw, they were both working with Just Intonation as a starting point. I can say only say that ditatonic "functions" are related to diatonic scale, but Riemann's program in assigning a functional label to any chord in a given tonality doesn't work, because not all music is based on diatonic thinking and pitch material.  
Tonality  doesn't have to do anything with diatonic scale and even consonance. There are plenty of microtonal scales that are not consonant (as 5-limit consonances), can't be partitioned in standard Western chords and still sound tonal and can sound resolved, because of their interval sizes and the voice leading possibilities of the musical gamut.  
Unfortunately, your understanding is lacking even in basic Western music; introducing more advanced concepts may muddle it even more.  
(Microtonal theorists use techniques from the theories of continued fractions, abstract algebra and lattice theory, Minkowski geometry, combinatorics etc and have different generalizations of concepts like tonality.

For example we can use selection bodies from n-dimensional lattices to construct the most important scales and chords. They are symmetrical and tile the n-dimensional plane.)  


Common practice composers actually didn't use the current theories - you can check books like  

The Study of <b><u>Harmony</u></b>: An Historical Perspective by Diether de la Motte,   
Music in the galant style - Robert Gjerdingen or  


  The Art of Accompaniment from a Thorough-Bass: As Practiced in the XVII and XVIII Centuries (in 2 volumes ) - F. T. Arnold.  


And of course, anyone can compose commercial music in any style. It's up to you to make it good and likeable to the public. While stuff like Alberti bass can sound primitive, of course, we can use other accompaniment figures as substitution. Adding a little more funky rhythms to a Bach style piece can improve it a lot, if you want people to dance to it for example (much of the old classical music is based on dances that noone remembers, maybe we have use currently popular rhythms to create "new classical" music).  


Classical music theory has the best and most developed practical methods and theories compared to the jazz for examples. I don't even know if there exists such thing as pop theory, because anything goes.  
In depth study of acoustics and (micro/macrotonal) scale theories has nothing to do with practical music making.  


&amp;#x200B;
</p></li><li><p><b>edmproduction</b><br>People consume music for 2 purposes mainly -

A&gt; Mood regulator - also functions in this role for example in movie soundtracks  
B&gt; Dancing .  


Do you think that general public gives a fuck about bad intonation as long as there is some emotion (let's define the emotion as set of parameters like: timbre colour, dynamics, melismatic techniques, vibrato, tremolo etc) in the voice?  


In dance music anything goes as long as there is strong rhythmical feel. Loudness and clean production are more important than musicality.  


If your target group is people with musical education and trained ears, you better create more complex music from theoretical standpoint with excellent performance, but this won't do anything for the tone-deaf crowds.  


Another problem with vocal performances is that the optimal intonation for blended <b><u>harmony</u></b>  is away from currently used equal temperament and amateur singers can actually sound more in-tune that trained singers that have hundreds of hours drilling solfeggio runs alongside piano accompaniment (and professional "deformations", singing closer to 12ET than the natural overtones and more pure intervals)...  
Auto-tuning naturally played instruments like voices or let's say unfretted strings instruments to 12ET can have the opposite effect, creating more out of tune textures.  


  

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Old blues songs make a good use of half diminished.   
African music in general makes a good use of septimal intervals and pentatonics and there are 2 interpretations of it in 7-limit, along with dominant and minor seventh chords as septimal chords. Septimal seventh chords are similar to major/minor and form progressions and scales that are similar to Neo-Riemannian transformations and familiar Western "tonal" scales. I haven't listened to too much Wagner, but I have a recording of Debussy's La Mer that has clearly intonated septimal chords.   Get 22 or 31 edo guitar for experimentation with novel "jazz" <b><u>harmony</u></b>.  

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>12-tet is good in 3-limit ( almost pure fifths/ fourths, also the major whole tone is almost pure) and it's good in higher limits like 17 or 19, but they are discordant (basically chromatic semitones, tritones etc).

Major/minor triadic chord are not blended in 12, if you find them consonant, but JI out of tune, go check your ears...

You can always retune 12ET to something else supporting 12 notes per octave -  im some kind of Pythagorean (if you like 3-limit that much, there are even few pure major thirds there), 5-limit: schismic - 12 notes out of 41 or 53, quarter comma meantone (the most used tuning for centuries) - 12 notes out of  205(it is considered to be the best tuning for Western type chord progression) ; diaschismic - 12 out of 34 or 46. You can also retune in 7-limit to get some bluesy intervals or in some kind of arabic tuning (11/13 limit), but it won't be good for <b><u>harmony</u></b> with only 12 notes per octave (you will need more)

22, 19, 17 (this one doesn't really work for triadic <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but it's very great for melody) are my favourite.

Slightly more than 24: 

26, 27, 29, 31, 34, 41

&amp;#x200B;

You can map 12 pitches out of bigger scale to a normal piano keyboard, so you don't have to restrict yourself in using small edos, if you don't have a special microtonal instruments.( Just use a mode of limited transposition with 12 pitches or a scale generated by a microtonal perfect fifth, or select arbitrary 12 pitches that you like.)

29 and 41 are very special for <b><u>harmony</u></b>, imo. You can play 2 flavours (with slightly higher or lower third) of major/minor  triads without sounding out of tune. 

But all these are not really "xenharmonic". I think that weird inharmonic edos are more properly used for xenharmonic music - 8, 13, 18,14, 20, 21, 23 - maybe something like gamelan-like instrument or special synth timbres make these manageable to listen to. I wouldn't expect anytime soon to hear  commercial  xenharmonic tunes using inharmonic scales and timbres.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Diminished chord doesn't really to resolve in a direction according to some stylistic rules . It's just dissonant even in just intonation; you can use it a basic consonance, but it will never really sound nice . You can compose some kind of "spy jazz/blues theme" in locrian or make  a melody and duplicate the the part a third up for simple <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but don't expect it to become a mainstream hit song.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Pythagorean is closer to 12 ET in sound than to just intonation (which sounds better than both of them). You can modulate in pythagorean and use modal mixture. I don't really know what your comment about the core of Western <b><u>harmony</u></b> and pythagorean tuning should have mean, because it's clearly disinformation. 

Anyway,   “How Equal Temperament Ruined <b><u>Harmony</u></b>” is probably about meantone, not about pythagorean. Meantone is the base of Western <b><u>harmony</u></b> and all the common practice progressions and was abandoned when mass production of pianos made meantone not optimal for commercial products. Plus you have to stick to classical progressions in it, no modulation in remote keys (unless you have more than 12 keys per octave)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meantone\_temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meantone_temperament)

(There are 4 major and 3 minor triads - and obviously - their inversions plus all the fifths - in 12 notes pythagorean that are better than anything in meantone or 12 equal, but that's not enough to make it good for more complex <b><u>harmony</u></b>)

&amp;#x200B;

Coltrane doesn't play in 12 tempered which is possible and perfectly  *realizable*  with electronic devices like synthesizers, but every good brass, wind, string player or vocalist adjusts his intonation all the time, so it's more complex than sticking to a certain system.

Much of the mathematical or psychological side of the music may be just speculations.   
For example in the book "Tuning, timbre, spectrum, scale" Sethares proposes "xenharmonic" tunings and timbres for new kinds of music, but the use of such type of tools is very limited, because of the way our brains work (basically it's too complex - it won't sound out of tune, but it won't sound "consonant" in the traditional sense, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and counterpoint have to very limited and simplistic, because the timbres are already "chords"; the same reason why polytonal music sounds like garbage  - "xenharmonic enthusiasts" have even tried to classify non-octave scales and theory along with octaves, but good luck with this basically polytonal music when our brains recognize only octave equivalences as real).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I often see posts like this where someone asks why certain progression works, but why it shouldn't work is my question?

Here is a paper on harmonic functions that includes exotic scales, not only the diatonic collection, so the theory is more general than Riemannian functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> that is usually taught at schools.

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286865109\_Tonal\_function\_in\_harmonic\_scales](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286865109_Tonal_function_in_harmonic_scales)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hm, I'm not sure that 13 is that bad. 13 equal is crappy, but we can create 13 note unequal symmetrical scale by splitting the tritone. See for example 19, 31,43 etc ET (where the 12 note scale is not symmetrical, but the 13 note is).

Another way to create is to take the double harmonic scale (in just tuning) and transpose it up and down a fifth.

We get again 13 notes with tritone being split into 45/32 and 64/45- 53 equal is good for this - the difference is called diaschisma. If we temper it we get 12 note scale (that is not meantone tuning - 34 and 46 are good for this ).

There are other good 13 note scales, but they are more xenharmonic (maybe some of them are good for late romantic <b><u>harmony</u></b>).

You are also overrating how good 12 is. See this - [https://en.xen.wiki/w/The\_Riemann\_Zeta\_Function\_and\_Tuning](https://en.xen.wiki/w/The_Riemann_Zeta_Function_and_Tuning)

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In a texture dominated by major-minor triadic structures, you probably don't want too many fourths or fifths just sitting there, empty.

Even more primitive <b><u>harmony</u></b> is this based just on the fifth or fourth as consonance and everything else - dissonance (ancient people were known to sing in octaves, fiths and fourths, also Eastern Asian cultures and I guess some Medieval music).

More advanced form of <b><u>harmony</u></b> would be based on tetrads (various permutations of the intervals of the dominant chord) - like jazz. I guess it implies septimal tuning (I have some recordings of La Mer by Debussy and some Wagner operas where you can clearly hear septimal intonation).

I guess the - most primitive <b><u>harmony</u></b> is octaves = 2/1 and 1/2.

Then come fourths and fifths - 5/4 x 4/3 = 2/1

Then come triads - 5/4x6/5x5/4 = 2/1

Then come tetrads (dominant, half dim. chords etc) based on intervals like = 5/4x6/5x7/6x/8/7 = 2/1 - this would be the barbershop seventh.

We can continue to divide the octave, but the more intervals we get, it get's more discordant (not really dissonant, because all these are simple ratios found in the overtone series)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You can choose any number of pitches and call it a scale... A scale can be melodically interesting, but not useful for <b><u>harmony</u></b>, so if you want <b><u>harmony</u></b>, look for scales that contain major or minor triads.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Perfect example for misunderstanding what "functional" means. Riemann (the same guy with the "neo-Riemannian"  functions) used the mathematical meaning of function (image/mapping) and a big part of his program is basically to label every chord progression as tonic, dominant or subdominant (too bad that this is not possible, because not every piece of music is based on major or minor tonality ). This part of his theory is based on his investigations of the structure of the diatonic scale in just intonation.

Well, we can use other types of scales and create new "functions", but this is in general useless (it will create another narrow "functional system", but based on another scale), because you can get a better overview of the whole system  you are using (what chord progressions are possible) by checking what commas are tempered - for example: in meantone (the standard CPP tuning) romantic/jazz/modernist chord progressions (let's say using chromatic mediants/tritone subs/symmetrical chords etc) are NOT possible without being out of tune or require enharmonic shifts (needing more than 12 notes per octaves), because these in meantone (aside from 12 equal) are separated by small intervals just like in just intonation (so Gb is not F#, Ab is not G# etc).

In 12 equal both diatonic and "romantic/jazz" (whatever is called) <b><u>harmony</u></b> are supported, but there are equal temperaments (let's say 27 equal = 9x3 - it has augmented chords and semi-decent approximations of 5 limit interval)   where you may play "chromatic" that is not "meantone" in this one (diatonic scale with have a wolf fifth like in Just tuning).

Layering drum percussions is also useless in a heavy melodic  music (with contrapuntal lines etc), none of it will be heard or drums will overpower the melody (there is a reason why in classical music drums are used as accents mainly). 

You can't have super complex melody, bass, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and drums going at the same time - choose which one you want to be the most important element and layer it (in pop music it's the vocals), leave the rest of the elements as supporting the main part.

There is plenty of Asian music that you can hear online (youtube). Often times it's pretty  and advanced - like various tremolos, vibrato and pitch bends, short grace note ornamentations - these don't work easy well with <b><u>harmony</u></b> - you have to be careful.

There is no good way to create decent contrapuntal voice leading using  fifths/fourths  and complex texture (it's trivial to create elementary 2-part counterpoint)- it's mathematically impossible (see Tymoczko's Geometry of music), so there is no consistent way of doing it and general theory.

Actually, real instruments also have inharmonicity, so perfect <b><u>harmony</u></b> is something illusory - many additive synths can create perfectly harmonic instruments (basically all real pianos are tuned using ear and are with non-uniformely stretched octaves ) and they are lifeless.

" understanding that is much deeper at how things may work compared to other texts, and the pieces start to fall together. "

I wowed at this. Some of the techniques  in the book are good, despite being simple, but you are delusional, if you think that you grasped something "deep". 

If you are dealing with period music: better learn how were people thinking back then and more about their tuning system (something that is ignored in most mainstream theory books, including various Schenker based theories). Learning more about psychoacoustics and tuning theory is beneficial  (because there is just one real "<b><u>harmony</u></b>", what kind of stylistic language - for example: Medieval, Renaissance, Late romantic etc - you will use is another question), but all this  is a rabbit hole...

Hm, "usable" - if you check all the intervals in popular historical well temperaments, you will see that some of them are even more distorted than in popular meantone or many small equal temperaments. So, some of them suck for <b><u>harmony</u></b>, but are passable for melody (there are no "wolves").

Equal, unequal, JI - there is no perfect system.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Bach's music (most of the time) uses  meantone type modulations, so it doesn't matter what he used. There is nothing that 12 equal that can't render reasonably (which is not the case for compositions that exploit extended meantone or some other 5-limit tuning - 34 equal for example is closer to just tuning and it's not meantone - traditional progressions and scales are very annoying there, because of the syntonic comma, but "double harmonic" scale is perfect for it, because diaschisma is not tempered)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>" Like sticking to one particular scale and also using this scale's chords  for accompaniment, rather than those from another one. Or not playing a  C and a D at the same time, because they don't harmonize with each  other too well. " - Well, these are not rules, I can't understand how you came with this...  


There are infinite pitches in just intonation that differ by some small interval (that can be even impossible to recognize - like fraction of a cent). Your chord progressions will drift away by such intervals unless you are playing in a tuning that distorts the intervals, so you have "loops" that allow you to go back to where you came from or you have to modulate a small interval up or down.

Traditional Western music is based on meantone tuning (which is a tuning that discards the syntonic comma - around 20 cents). Music, written in meantone, can be translated to any meantone system -  so you can compose in 12 equal and retune to 19, 26, 31, 55 and many others. This is valid for any equal temperament - all of them support different systems and you can translate between them as long as you are sticking to one sub-temperament. If you are not sticking to particular "tonality" (like if you are using all 12 notes in some kind of free chromaticism), you are using the characteristic features of specific equal temperament and music can't be translated very well to other tuning systems.

Romantic and 20th century avantgarde (and jazz) exploits non-meantone chord progressions, so if the same commas are not tempered, you have to modulate a small interval in other equal systems (or it's even possible that your music has no close interpretation in them).

Smaller microtonal equal temperaments have more intervals tempered and are more forgiving for composition and playing (because you are not dealing with so many small intervals and there are more "loops" that don't need small intervals to function).

In general, stick to a certain equal temperament and learn it - for any one of them can be written a book with unique music theory "rules". 

19 and 31 support meantone in better intonation than 12 equal.

22, 26, 27 and 31 can be used for some kind of extended jazz/romantic septimal <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

17 is passable for oriental music, but has no good chords. 29 can be used for oriental music, but chords are weird.

34 is great for 5-limit music and oriental music, but it's not meantone, so major scale has wolf intervals like in just intonation.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Chromatic notes are usually used as a melismatic figure or in some kind of quick runs. They can be used freely, but it can often sound like a mess, because our minds create some kind of hierarchy of intervals and chromatics sound like alteration of each other - add all of them = garbage (most of the time).

Better use unconventional scales, if you are after unusual sounds. It's not like game music is chromatic. If you train your keyboard skills (or whatever instrument you are playing), you will be able to add natural quick chromatic gestures without ruining the melody or <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It's can be somewhat hard to notate correctly such ornamental figures.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Medieval oriental music theory is based on division of tetrachords and other intervals (I remember reading about some arabic theorists that was dividing 2 octaves or something similar.)

I doubt that that African or Indonesian music has anything to do with stacked perfect fifths.

And scales don't have to be 5 or 7 notes.

Btw, you can stack other intervals and get interesting results.

Stacking perfect fifths is good for European music, because 5/4x6/5 = 3/2, so you get major and minor thirds that are used for <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

Old arabic music did not use major-minor <b><u>harmony</u></b> and they were using more complex intervals.

There was found some flute on thousands of years in China - it was made for generally something like equal 7, according to article (in equal 7 you have 5 fifths that are very flat and there is no difference between major and minor).

Babylonians also knew about 12 note "Pythagorean" tuning way before Greeks.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Non-octave music does not work, because you don't hear notes separated by non-octave intervals as equivalent. People have experimented with 3/1 (perfect 12th) scales and the general opinion is that they sound bad (it's basically a form of  polytonality where the "octaves" are basically the circle of untempered fifths).

About the division of octaves - many work, not only 12 or 24. 

For good <b><u>harmony</u></b> some of  the best small ones are - 12, 19, 31, 34 (22,26, 27 and 29 are also somewhat passable, maybe 25 and 28, too). For melody many will work, probably most of them (Debussy managed to compose interesting music with whole tone scales, which is basically 6 equal, which is not a great tuning system ).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you know what intervals and chords are, you probably don't need more theory for practical music composition... No need for any rules, if you have inspiration, right?

12 equal supports way more stuff than diatonic scales, so don't get too much into thinking that major/minor tonalities and classical or jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b> are the only "right" theory.

Leave inversional and reflectional symmetries to Bartok, I doubt you want to sound exactly like this, plus there is nothing new in these theories, despite reddit's popularity of such topics (see Straus' book for introduction to such thinking - wikipedia's articles on geometric transformations can do even better job, except you have to apply them to musical objects like intervals, notes, chords, voice leading... ).

Maybe 19 ET is good for blues and modernist (Debussy/Stravinsky) type music. To my ears it sounds more "edgy" or "glassy" than other popular meantone tunings like 31 (which is more in tune, but in more septimal way, so more jazzy) or 43 equal (where we get all kinds of diminished and augmented intervals more in tune with the rest of the 5-limit meantone scale, but they are not that septimal, more like middle eastern).

This is false. Minor 7 is not a permutation of dominant 7. 

\- Come on. That's basic combinatorics, you are the one who is wrong. 3 interval chord - like major/minor has 3! = 6 permutations, which are the major and minor chords and their 2 "inversions".

4 interval chord = 4! = 24, and we have 6 distinct septimal chords from these( when we disregard "inversions" like we do with major/minor triads) in 7-limit <b><u>harmony</u></b> for example, if we permutate all the intervals of the septimal dominant chord 4:5:6:7, which is supposed to be the basic building block in let's say 22 or 27 equal (major chord is 4:5:6). In 12 equal two of the intervals are equalised and 6 distinct chords shrink to just 3.

Flips also have axes. See Straus - Introduction to post tonal theory's part about symmetry and Bartok for musical introduction to this stuff.

"Tritones" are not that dissonant intervals... If tuned as 7/5 (which is exactly the interval we get between 5/4 and 7/4 in barbershop music when they play septimal dominant), it can be actually thought as a some kind of consonant dyadic chord... actually way more consonant than some bigger chords that we can hear in jazz or classical music.

Your problem is that you need several pitches, separated by a comma for each note in your musical system, so a "fifth" is 3/2, but also 40/27 and 243/160 (these are wolf fifths against 1/1, but have use in actual music compositions with just intonation)  and such "superchromatic"  differences may sound garbage, if you modulate by such a small interval; other example 9/8 and 10/9 - again 81/80 difference; or various types of tritones.

In  less accurate tuning system that's away from just intonation, your melodies will still sound like garbage, despite not having small, "unmelodic" commas in this "melodic system".   
You may detune some partials to match better the tuning system, but this won't create some kind of novel compositional resources, because new timbres should be still somewhat close to abstract, pure overtone series or they will sound inharmonic and ugly in whatever tuning and scales you use.

Detuning partials of electronic organs to 12 ET makes them sound better; one guy on microtonal facebook demonstrated timbre, based on 15 equal - I guess he detuned the 3rd (+octaves) and 5th (+ octaves) harmonics to be a little sharp.

(If you are looking for a scale with good sounding melodies, but not great <b><u>harmony</u></b>, check 17 equal - I guess detuning 5th harmonic up or down may do the job and make it better for <b><u>harmony</u></b> with electronic instruments)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't know anything about Latvian music, but these Bulgarian pieces of music are based on folk music (there is one part of country where they were using minor seconds in folk songs), there was no choral tradition in this country outside of church music, which is based on Byzantian tradition. Still, the original folk music is way simpler. These arrangements are made by professional composers.

Just mix natural minor and phrygian, add vibrato and you are good to go. Drones were the main <b><u>harmony</u></b> before Western music became popular. Lydian is not a popular mode. Mixing dorian and mixolydian is popular. Phrygian dominant is popular. Pentatonic scales are popular. Octatonic is popular near Romania (see Bartok and gypsy violin music etc). Uncommon meters are popular.

Balkan instrumental music is more interesting, imo, it is very ornamental, using fast tempos and is played in two voices a third or sixth apart, creating a thick texture.

I have never managed to understood the appeal of listening to music using minor seconds as a <b><u>harmony</u></b>, wow, and I am a Bulgarian. (Btw, these old   
 composer could have harmonized many pieces of folk music in a way, similar to Spanish/Moorish music, but instead they chose more "avantgarde" sounding sonorities.)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>"  I'm left with a lingering impression that <b><u>harmony</u></b> has no where else to go "

Hm, are you talking about classical music or what? You are free to do anything there - from dyadic <b><u>harmony</u></b> to microtonal clusters.

I doubt pop music will ever become different. Even microtonal 5-limit just intonation or temperaments stuff is basically the same old major and minor triads that will always be in vogue.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Technical and complex doesn't mean it's good music, right (and most metal doesn't fit your description)? Or else Ferneyhough would be the best composer ever lived.

 If the group delivers virtuosity in some aspects and suck in everything else - like having intelligible lyrics, interesting melodic ostinatos/melodies, varied instrumentation, don't bother to promote it. Having a "sick" drum pattern or a "good" guitar solo melody won't fix a  flawed composition.

That's why a well balanced composition (melody, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, rhythm) even without any virtuosity sounds better than any "technical" composition. I would say that if we use youtube for popularity metric, non-technical songs with catchy melodies and rhythms are most popular metal songs.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not sure whose idea was to teach  that usage of natural minor is not functional, that's really distortion of the ideas of Oettingen/Riemann.

 (And with proper voice leading we can make other modes sound more final, too, some Renaissance  people liked phrygian type cadences and melodies. I guess such stuff is now associated with Spanish music, but it was more common back then not only in Spain . Maybe we can use alterations of modes for better <b><u>harmony</u></b> or melody  in certain passages - this was actually done in Italy - that's why two of the "Neapolitan" scales are named this way instead of phrygian "something". I guess Dorian remains in minor territory,  Lydian (used in film music of 20th century, right) and various gypsy/exotic scales (with augmented sixth or other Beethovian/Chopin type cadences in the scale structure) maybe have some promise.)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Popular jazz musicians had arrangers that were already copying these guys (and the style of some more modern jazz musicians seem more in this vein than in dixie/swing/bebop stuff), so you better study the masters... of course, I talk about <b><u>harmony</u></b> and orchestration, not about jazz improvisation or how to play the same old jazz chord sequences from bebop era etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>First tell us why do you think it should sound bad...

If something sounds bad it is usually because it sounds like chromatic alteration of just heard interval in melody or some kind of clash between melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

You can even play out of tune microtonal intervals over a major chord and there is a good chance it will sound decent.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>None of these channels is "serious" for learning anything (12 tone is good, but nothing is in depth). Compare for example to Alan Belkin's channel that has whole courses on <b><u>harmony</u></b>, orchestration, counterpoint,  musical analysis... and has 12k subscribers. I guess the target group is completely different.

In Bebop the improvisation takes more of a "vertical" approach, meaning that the (more complex) chord changes of a song are outlined in the solo, rather than stating the melody. Bebop also uses a lot more tension and dissonance in <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody. 
</p></li><li><p><b>Jazz</b><br>When it comes to mastering the fretboard, there is nothing I can recommend more than "Fingerboard Breakthrough" by Howard Morgen. It is a TrueFire course; here you can see the introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ojEu8xsIS8

Howard Morgen was an awesome teacher. imo this is the best introduction to reaching familiarity with the guitar there is period. You will also get a far better understanding of <b><u>harmony</u></b> as movement rather than static chords; melodic improvisation however is not really covered. 

Just check out the introduction video and decide, if it will be usefull for you. Good luck on the journey!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In a blues you typically use Dominant 7 I, IV and V chords (1,3,5,b7) and the melodies / solos would use the blue notes (b3 and b7, b5 as a passing note)

A blues soloist in G would therefore replace the B with a Bb and the F# with an F even though the B and F# are still used in the <b><u>harmony</u></b>
</p></li><li><p><b>Jazz</b><br>Yeah, this. I would add: transcribe solos from the jazz greats and analyze how their note choices work against the <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

On a side note: It is such a crying shame that classical music has completely abandoned improvisation as an integral part of music education and performance. Bach and Beethoven must've had incredible chops.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>I don't have any recommendations on basic music theory books, but I can throw some concepts at you, which will help you getting more comfortable with <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

First you probably want to get into the basics of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. This means that every chord in a key has a specific function. You already mentioned 1-4-5 progressions. In a major key the diatonic chords (chords that are built from the major scale) are: I ii iii IV V vi vii^o (this style of writing out the chords is called Roman Numeral Analysis: upper case -&gt; major chord; lower case -&gt; minor chord; lower case + o -&gt; diminished).

There are three general types of harmonic function: Tonic, Subdominant, Dominant.
Tonic chords are your home chords, they have a feeling of rest and are therefore often the last chords you are aiming towards in a phrase, section or piece of music because they feel complete.
Subdominant chords are a bit further away from "home" and introduce some tension. They will feel not as resolved and want to go somewhere, often and traditionally to a dominant chord.
Dominant chords contain a lot of tension and feel very unresolved. Ending a piece of music on a dominant will leave the listener wanting this chord to resolve (try playing a C-Am-F-G7 progression and end it on the G7). Dominant chords are used to lead us back to the tonic chord. It is all about the concept of tension and release.

With your diatonic chords the functions are as follows:
Tonic chords: I, iii and vi
Subdominant chords: ii and IV
Dominant chords: V and vii^o

As you can see, 1-4-5 is such a classic progression because it starts on a tonic, goes to a subdominant and then to a dominant, resolving back to the tonic and so on and so forth.

You can (and should) of course experiment with these chords and put them in any order you like, but Tonic-&gt;Subdominant-&gt;Dominant-&gt;Tonic is a good rule of thumb.

When you are getting comfortable with your diatonic chords, you can branch out to non-diatonic chords (look up Borrowed Chords or Modal Interchange for that) and further down the line maybe also look into non-functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.


A general tip for getting into music theory that I personally find to be very important:
Don't allow your knowledge to leave your ears behind.
Every time you learn a new concept like a progression from a book or a video, play it on your instrument and hear how it sounds. It's great to know what a tritone substitution is, it is far better to feel and hear what a tritone substitution is. Ears first, knowledge and technique second.


Sry for the wall of text; I hope that was somewhat helpful.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The [Barbershop <b><u>Harmony</u></b> Society](http://www.barbershop.org/about-us/definition-of-barbershop-<b><u>harmony</u></b>/) is probably a good place to start.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I think you totally got the main concept of a blues already: Having a (mostly) minor pentatonic melody in a major key, which creates a lot of interesting color.

The <b><u>harmony</u></b> is also unique: A 12 bar blues uses the I7, IV7 and V7 chords, so a dominant chord is perceived as the root chord. 

Related to that: in a blues solo you typically do not use scales that relate to the underlying chord but instead you strictly use the material from the minor pentatonic of the key over all chords. 

When you write that minor pentatonic out in relation to the chords of a 12 bar blues it will give you these intervals:

I7: 1-#9-4-#11-5-b7-1

IV7: 1-b9-9-4-5-b7-1

V7: 1-#9-4-b13-b7-maj7-1


  
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>I'd call that a riff, it adds <b><u>harmony</u></b> to the track, but you could easily put a melody on top of that. You don't have to, of course.
If you wanted to expand on that I would rather add another section, that changes the chords, so it doesn't too repetitive, or introduce new elements like chord stabs along the way.
That's just my take on it, there are a million ways you could add to your track.
</p></li><li><p><b>jazzguitar</b><br>I wouldn't worry about songs not being suited for guitar. You can learn any song you like. There might be songs that are a bit harder to play in a chord melody style, but as a beginner you want to first learn songs that will teach you common Jazz concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

I would recommend "Autumn Leaves" to be your first tune, because its <b><u>harmony</u></b> is relatively easy and consists almost exclusively of ii-V-I's, which is the most used chord progression in Jazz. It will also teach you about modulating between relative keys. Plus, the melody is very diatonic, easy to learn and you probably already know how it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other songs that are often recommend for beginners are: 

All Of Me

Take The A Train

Blue Bossa

So What (for modal <b><u>harmony</u></b>)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Always find at least some recordings of the tune you're learning and really get it into your ear before you look it up in the real book. The more you learn off of actual recordings the better.

&amp;#x200B;

Have fun on the journey!  
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b><br>I'm from Germany and here you also learn in school that the note is called H instead of B. What is even more confusing is the fact that what would be a Bb is called B in Germany (!)

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, my guitar teacher at that time was a major jazzhead and made me learn the international system of calling it B, which of course makes a ton more sense (ABCDEFG) and I would highly recommend calling it B.

Even my Jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b> book written and published in Germany calls it B.
</p></li><li><p><b>Jazz</b><br>There is no harm in skipping around, if you feel like it. Kind Of Blue is a great start for many people, but the album is also pretty special, since it is modal jazz, so the improvisations are based on musical modes. 

I think a great way to start to "get jazz" is to listen to standards (popular songs/tunes in Jazz) and get familiar with their melodies, then compare these so called heads to the improvisations the musicians play over these frameworks. A lot of times you will hear the band play the melody of a standard one time in the beginning, then take turns in soloing over the same chord progression and play the melody one more time right at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

A great example is Body And Soul, since it's been played and recorded by so many people. Listen to [Billie Holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXnQeb0rgpU) sing it, get to know the melody and then listen to [Coleman Hawkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUFg6HvljDE)' version of it and check out, what he does to the melody at the beginning and how his improvisation quickly transforms it into something completely new but still operating in the same framework (<b><u>harmony</u></b>/chords) as the main melody and staying true to the "feel" of it.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br><b><u>Harmony</u></b> is a very complex topic. Don't think of <b><u>harmony</u></b> only as blocks of chords in a sequence. Like you said, there is a lot of movement involved. Music is a linear art form and while a band performs a song, the melody and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> are constantly changing, sometimes creating a tense, dissonant sound, sometimes resolving this tension to a very pleasant sound, only to move away from it again.

&amp;#x200B;

The best way to think about <b><u>harmony</u></b> is as a bunch of voices that are there to support the melody. That means if you have a melody in the key of C Major, a guy singing only C notes in the background will sound pretty good. Now, this will get boring pretty quick, so the guy might start to sing his own melody, but he has to watch out, so that his notes don't clash with the notes of the main melody. His melody will most likely be more simple and repetitive, because the main melody is king and his job is to make it sound as good as possible. Now another guy joins in and starts singing. He has to watch out even more, so that his melody doesn't clash with either the main melody nor the supporting melody. The more voices you add, the more possibilities you have, but the more you have to think about what note each voice is singing at each given moment in time.

&amp;#x200B;

Those voices sounding together will form chords. Vertical blocks of sound. The chord symbols that we use today to present the <b><u>harmony</u></b> of a song (like: C G Am F) will give you a clue, how the melody should be harmonized during that specific part of the song. But it says nothing about how exactly you should interpret these chords, who will play what and when and (maybe most important) how you get from one chord to the next. For every chord progression there are millions of possibilities of how to play these chords. For example: A good bass player can make up a melody on the spot, that is not only interesting on its own but supports the melody and spells out the chord changes of the song, all at the same time. Which is of course a lot more interesting than playing C C C C C C C C over a C major chord

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>Take the key of C for example. If you have a C major chord in the background and you play an F note for too long over it, it will sound pretty gnarly, even though it is in the key. Play the same note over a G chord and it will sound very different and much better to most listeners. You can of course quickly go over those dissonant notes, but especially the notes on downbeats and the notes that are louder, longer, more prominent in any way will be perceived as part of the underlying <b><u>harmony</u></b>, which is not what you want in some cases.
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b><br>For Jazz improvisation I can highly recommend "Connecting Chords with Linear <b><u>Harmony</u></b>" by Bert Ligon. Like the title suggests, the book focuses on how a great solo should spell out the <b><u>Harmony</u></b> of a tune without the need for the rhythm section to do it. It was eye-opening for me and has tons of examples taken from real recordings to make its point.

&amp;#x200B;

Another big one for me was "Forward Motion" by Hal Galper. The two big concepts in this one are "Let the melody be your guide", which is related to Ligon's approach, and "The 1 in each bar is not the first bar. It is the last" which can do wonders for your phrasing and creates, well, forward motion.

&amp;#x200B;

For music theory in general: I don't what where you're at right now and what part of it you want to focus on, but [https://www.musictheory.net/](https://www.musictheory.net/) is a great starting point.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>Melody and <b><u>Harmony</u></b> are two sides of the same coin. If you play 7ths and 9ths in the melody, the overall sound will imply those extended chords.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It's called [Roman Numeral Analysis](https://www.musictheory.net/lessons/44) and is pretty helpful when talking about <b><u>harmony</u></b>
</p></li><li><p><b>Jazz</b><br>[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUUtcdPLKzA) is a great introductory video about "How to listen to Jazz". His channel has some really good info for Jazz newcomers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; it's also weird because i can listen to jazz, but not remember anything that was just played... 

&amp;#x200B;

You won't find a lot of catchy, constantly repeated melodies in Jazz, but the more you listen to it, the more you'll recognize certain phrases, motifs and melodic ideas in improvised solos. Before you know it, you'll be able to sing along to your favourite solos.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; am i overthinking jazz, or are there really that many mechanics to it? 

&amp;#x200B;

Jazz is a vast musical style that changed a lot since its birth with lots of sub-genres and even more individual approaches to rhythm, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and improvisation. Sometimes you can hear more clearly where artists are coming from and that they're heavily influenced by players of the past, sometimes it'll be more like comparing Bach and Schönberg because they both composed "Classical Music" (Listen to some Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five followed by Peter Brötzmann as an example).

&amp;#x200B;

What you'll hear a lot of times are Jazz standards (well known songs that are often played) as vehicles or blue prints for improvisation. The melody (also called head) is played once by the band, after this chorus the musicians will each improvise over the same chord progression that the melody was played over and come up with new melodic ideas. After the solos the melody is stated a last time. This not always the case, but as you get more familiar with Jazz you'll hear the same heads more and more.

&amp;#x200B;

A great example: Autumn Leaves (here sung by [Nat King Cole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gnp58oepHUQ))

Jazz interpretations:

[Chet Baker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgn7VfXH2GY)

[Cannonball Adderley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsz6TE6t7-A)

[Bill Evans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Z8KuwI7Gc)

&amp;#x200B;

All versions have the same basis (melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>) but the interpretations and the different approaches for the improvisation are very different.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b><br>While it's true that Jazz uses a lot of 7th chords (V7, Secondary Dominants, Tritone Substitutions), in most Jazz tunes you'll find all other chord qualities as well.

I'm generalizing here, but the main approach in most Jazz solos is to play with what Bert Ligon calls "Harmonic Specificity", spelling out the changes of the song with your note choices (especially connecting the 3's and 7's) while also keeping it interesting with chord extensions and chromaticism. There is of course not one single method to do it and you will hear players who also heavily utilize Blues ideas, draw their soloing ideas directly from the melody or play "outside" of the <b><u>harmony</u></b> only to resolve back to chord tones. 

A big part of the unique sound of Jazz also comes from the rhythm
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Well, this piece has pretty complex <b><u>harmony</u></b> that uses a lot of chromaticism. If you want to put a scale to it, the C#m13 chord is indeed Dorian, but it makes more sense to call it F#7add4 (as they also did in the last 4 bars), and to think of it as the V of B. This B7 can be seen as the V of E7, which itself resolves to EbMaj7#11 (as they did in the second 4 bars)

But naming these chords and analyzing them in a functional way can only go so far, because I don't think that's the point of this tune
</p></li><li><p><b>Guitar</b><br>What sound you are getting depends on the harmonic context. If you play the notes of G Major (G A B C D E F#) over a G major chord, you get the Major Scale or Ionian mode, play it over a D Major (or D7) <b><u>harmony</u></b> and you get D Mixolydian. 

&gt; I know A is the 2nd note in the G major scale and using it as the root would this be where modes come into play? Which mode would it be? 

Yes, kind of. Playing the G major scale over A will give you the A Dorian mode. But don't think of this as having anything to do with the G Major scale, really, because you are in the key of A, and this is where all sounds will be related to. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Playing the chord progression with chords and/or arpeggios, playing countermelodies, adding to existing <b><u>harmony</u></b> with extended chords or different voicings, playing the melody a third above. Lots of stuff to do
</p></li></ol></div><hr><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">User: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/expiredvegetable>expiredvegetable</a><ol><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Fellow hack here. Fux's book 'Gradus Ad Parnassum' (study of counterpoint) helped me attain better musicianship quickly. I got the translation by Alfred Mann which is clear and concise. It explores counterpoint alongside logical <b><u>harmony</u></b>/voice leading. 

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>That is interesting. I am always astonished by Bach's musical ability, especially pieces like invention 13 in A minor where the <b><u>harmony</u></b> feels quite full despite, as you stated, the limitations of two voice pieces. Thank you
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This has cleared up much of my confusion. I have been approaching composition through counterpoint from the 16th century rather than modelling my efforts after Bach. Your comments have been really helpful. Particularly about Bach's <b><u>harmony</u></b> being the forefront.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm confused by what you mean. I'll try.

I feel like you are dealing with key signatures not major scales. A scale is just a formula imposed on a note to get logical <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 

Ear training will help you discern whether a song is in major or minor. Familiarising yourself with cadences will help to tell you, as they are the defining moments in a song, and will tell us which <b><u>harmony</u></b> is the the tonic. Etc

E.g You hear a V-i cadence 
You distinctly recognise the tension of a dominant, perhaps you can recognise the tritone. This <b><u>harmony</u></b> then resolves into a tonic. 


Then you can play a few notes around this to tell you what key signature you are in.

What is your knowledge of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>12tone have a lesson on it, on YouTube. That could be a good place to start. 

Functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> isn't really too complicated. Except people disagree about the role of the iii chord. The rest is logical and applies to every key in the same way. Let me know if you want me to break it down. Otherwise good luck
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Definitely learn scales, but understand first what they are. Learn pieces that can develop independence of the hands.

Learning about functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is essential for any musician. Learning just these three things will take you incredibly far.

Can I just add that scales are often taught in such a boring way, because well they are boring. You build from scales, it is a foundation if you will. Good luck. I can recommend some pieces but what are you into?
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>See this is the confusing thing about breaking music down into difficulties. Whilst a Bach invention is considered more difficult a piece, I feel it could potentially be a better study piece than Fur Elise, regardless of how well you initially play it. Even just from an analytical perspective, you can learn about functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> and voice leading, and writing melodies.

OP, depending on how brave you are feeling, I recommend the Bach inventions if you are into that kind of music. You don't need to play them or study them now but maybe a few months in when you have a solid foundation on functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, they could serve you well. It's all about finding what works for you as a student and composer though so disregard this if you do not want to learn Bach. Also, if you have questions about functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> or voice leading this subreddit will be quick to break it down and do it concisely. Good luck!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is a good question and I don't know the answer so I am looking forward to a response from someone knowledgeable. Of course it matters how you go about voicing or implying the major 7, but with correct voice leading no other <b><u>harmony</u></b> seems so 'wistful', as you said.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I agree with you. I feel, however, for a lot of people a greater emphasis on composition would go a long way because most people that learn music want to make their own music. And at the same time as teaching composition, you can teach the logic of <b><u>harmony</u></b> and voice leading and the student will want to apply those skills to make better and better music... 

Then you can kill a whole bunch of birds with one almighty stone.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>They can probably relate what they hear to what they have heard before, and depending on their exposure certain things may sound 'off' or 'on'. Most melodies which use a leading tone for example, if it doesn't resolve in a dominant function <b><u>harmony</u></b> will sound 'off'. So they would be able to pick up on a weak melody. If a melody is too repetitive they might be bored of it. 

If they listen to delta blues they might be more accustomed to unexpected dissonance and then hearing something as refined as strict counterpoint might be rather shocking or vice versa.

So relative to their exposure of music perhaps, their expectations may even coincide with that of a trained musician. All trained musicians can probably sus out a weak melody, weak rhythm and so too can a non-musician. But only the former have the capacity to discuss the subject analytically.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>How do you enjoy jazz? I don't think you can, and if you detest it so much you don't need to. You will not win intellectual brownie points by liking it. 

I have hated most jazz I have heard. To me it sounds like musicians thinking they are smart when they whack on infinity amount of notes to a chord and the ultimate effect to me is they just obscure the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. This annoys me. I hear a lot of unprepared dissonance. This annoys me some times. And in musical communities, jazz is full of pretentious people. So is everything from rock to baroque but something about the jazz community makes me annoyed.

I don't think you have to train to enjoy it(you probably could). If something doesn't make you enjoy it on its own merits then why bother?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Superficial? I don't feel theoretical matters are superficial. Nor was I referring to chords exclusively. There are other forms of <b><u>harmony</u></b> besides chords,chord,chord... 
And blues music has it's own  way of voice leading that tells it apart from baroque or classical, so what is it that we should be looking deeper into? That an often disgruntled demographic produced the two forms?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Oh god Fux!
I'm not sure I understand your question-can you explain what you mean by intervals that don't follow each other?

From what I see, using an F after just using an F# would be a little crude in strict counterpoint because the <b><u>harmony</u></b> is deviating without subtlety nor time to incorporate the new note.

My understanding may be wrong about this though, but sometimes the effect can be a little rough around the edges when you alter a note in a scale and quickly alter it again.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Nothing is 'necessary' since anyone can write a song but I think at the least the skill to compose a vocal melody so you can sing your words. 

I would say it is pretty much 'necessary' to understand functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> to an appropriate level. 
I don't want to be dogmatic though because some songs can be affecting with little in the way of theory going on but it seems most songwriters know how to compose a good melody &amp; how to match that with logical <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Hope this answers your question.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is not true. None of this true.
'any minor chords will do' is ridiculous. Have you heard of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>? Are you suggesting OP just play any minor chords? People who want to learn this subject are fed all kinds of misinformation and it is comments like yours that serve to confuse beginners. 
'basically it needs to be slow' again ridiculous. If OP took this as gospel truth we'd have only slow nonsense progressions. Whilst speed can affect the mood, slow doesn't correlate with sad. 

I suggest if you want to espouse musical knowledge you actually learn the subject.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So rhythm is crucial obviously. There are no set rules on what feels sad, it does get a bit subjective, so trial and error. 

However the melodic interval of a minor 6th is regarded as quite forlorn. A melody that begins with one will almost certainly descend straight away by step - if you don't know let me mention that contour is important in a melody. Most leaps ought to be mitigated for a sensible &amp; effective melody. 

Syncopation - this could be something as simple and effective as using suspensions against the bass, or displacing the attack of a note. 

A melody that uses notes which form dissonance with the underlying <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It could be something as simple as singing C-B over an A bass note. Then the bass notes drops down to G
This is a 2-3 suspension. 

A melody which moves by predominantly by step can be quite sad, make the rhythm interesting and you will be on your way. My advise is learn lots of pieces by your favourite composers which you feel are sad. 

(Some of the things I have mentioned do require more in depth analysis which I could provide but this is reddit and I am trying to keep this short so you don't get bored. Let me know if you need some further explanations, I'd be happy to help)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So I only glanced through the <b><u>harmony</u></b> but there's nothing in it that is particularly shocking. As to why an F major occurs though the tonality points to F minor, not all music fits nicely into the confines of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Why does it occur then? Maybe the musicians just wanted it to surprise the listener? It certainly isn't a modulation, the rest of the song doesn't reinforce F major, it seems to just occur unprepared and then uncontinued. 

You said the subdominant doesn't pull anywhere which isn't really true. Ordinarily it's function is a precursor to the dominant. 

Using the V chord is normal, it is a dominant function chord in minor pieces, it incorporates a leading tone which isn't found in aeolian but was developed in harmonic minor to we could get a leading tone and thus a stronger cadence. 

I am confused by what you mean VII provides the most suspense-could you elaborate?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No one yet has brought up one aspect of discussion which is called dissonance cushioning.

In a full major 7 chord

C E G B

We have notes that relate consonantly to both our C and B notes so they dissonance is slightly mitigated.

It is still present however but that isn't a bad thing - what matters is whether the dissonance will be resolved (so that it doesn't sound out of place)

Playing just the interval of a major 7th is rough, there is nothing to sweeten the blow. Nor is the <b><u>harmony</u></b> particularly clear.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes it is. 3rds and 6ths imply <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Unless you are very careful to imply otherwise you will be playing a C major chord in this example. 

Your example is something that is very common in counterpoint - however, outside of counterpoint we usually prefer the full triad. I am surprised that you are already learning this at a beginner level. Best of luck.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The fifth lacks <b><u>harmony</u></b>. The third is very rich however. 

&gt;A perfect fifth is just about the strongest interval you can have to delineate a chord

That's not the case - you need a third otherwise it is unclear what is implied - major or minor? You can't tell from the interval of a fifth. 

However C-E is C major unless you are very careful to imply otherwise
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br> Why should I want gaps to when I can do without them in the first place? 

The point I was making is not contentious. If you look at any counterpoint you see a preference for imperfect consonances and for a good reason. They are the richest intervals and they imply <b><u>harmony</u></b> the best. Perfect intervals are hollow by comparison and relying on a perfect interval to imply a chord is a weak compositional device and has been regarded as such for hundreds of years.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Why should I want gaps to when I can do without them in the first place?

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't doubt that I may be incorrect in music theory matters but if you could provide me with a theorist/music professor who agrees with your point of view I would appreciate it.

My point of view is that it lacks <b><u>harmony</u></b>. You seem to be contending this strongly and I am somewhat shocked being that it flies in the face of everything I have been taught. I know the fifth can be used to imply a chord, but the preference among musicians is to not depend on it. You also state the fifth contains the third, but you can hardly tell me that playing a fifth by itself sounds as sweet/harmonious as a third or I'll call you crazy. Is the third that is contained not greatly diminished? 

You also mentioned that you see them at the end of a piece. The reason for this is because it is considered to be against repose to use a third/sixth at the end.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>So you would need to study part writing. Essentially the bass should ensure proper inversions whilst adhering to the guidelines of writing for parts, this means you have to follow the 'rules' of voice leading. 

In part writing the melody (usually the top voice-soprano) dominates, the bass ensures inversions and may or may not make good counterpoint against it. The bass by itself tends to jump around a lot to do this. 

The middle voices tend to fill in the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. In and of themselves they are often rather boring (tenor and alto). 

However, you could try a more active counterpoint, where all voices need to be interesting and independent. It's up to you how to harmonise a melody.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No problem about being new, we were all once.

There are four perfect intervals:
Unison
Fifth
Octave (eighth) 
Fourth

All perfect intervals with the exception of the fourth are consonant. 

The perfect intervals don't provide much in the way of <b><u>harmony</u></b>. They are usually sweetened with a third or sixth, which also gives them context

C-C is a perfect eighth, which by itself is hollow

But C-C-E, is given the context of spelling out C major. The third sweetens the octave and relates consonantly to it. 

Once you are familiar with chords you will learn more practical applications for the consonances.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Bach arrives at sonorities that could be called augmented chords but I don't think it's functional to analyse them as such. Remember that in counterpoint the composer can take leeway with functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. It's not so much about the vertical as it is the horizontal and the result of this focus means sometimes the vertical can produce odd results.

Passing tones, chord tones? Both, simultaneously. The result is rich.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>A-C# implies a major. To generalise, the relationship of a third is where <b><u>harmony</u></b> comes from
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>People seem to talk about his harmonies - can you give some examples of his 'rich harmonies'? I'm not familiar with this musician.

I am a stick in the mud when it comes to <b><u>harmony</u></b>. If the man is just playing hundreds of extensions within a framework of triads, I don't think it is necessarily rich at all. If his voicing and voice leading is sophisticated then yes.

(I don't wish to suggest that using different harmonies is bad - people can do what they want, but 'rich harmonies' should be an objective quality, so what is Collier doing that is 'rich'?)
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Music theory and maths are not the same. If you decide learn the overtone series there are ratios, but you don't need to learn that.

Some pointers: Music theory is concerned with how notes relate to each other (<b><u>harmony</u></b>) and how move/change in relation to <b><u>harmony</u></b> (voice leading) 

It's concerned with writing melodies - what makes a good melody isn't an equation or a formula. It's about rhythm and contour (I'm generalising) 

The only time it seems mathematical is because we have to refer to some things with numbers. But you do that the same for everything, it's basic communication. E.g you go to the shops and calculate your budget, you tell your friend the score of a football game. In music if you want to tell your friend about the dominant chord, you might just call it 'V' or '5'.

And just because it isn't maths doesn't mean it is easy. It's not easy. Music isn't easy.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm not sure why some people are giving confusing answers here.

What you are playing is an implied A minor. You've excluded the fifth. It still suggests A minor.

People have mentioned a chord needs 3 notes. It is so. However, an implied <b><u>harmony</u></b> doesn't need 3 notes and thus needn't be complete. You only need a third (or the inversion of a third) to imply <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 
(OP you might be interested in what Bach could do with just two notes at any one time - check out his two part inventions) 

There are many reasons why we use A-C-A as oppose to A-C-E. If you want I can get into that topic briefly. Anyway, I hope this is clear and concise.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;if there's any extra info

So incomplete chords happen very often in counterpoint, simply put:

Counterpoint is the interaction of two 'melodies' that are independent on their own, but when together they form <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

The reason it happens in counterpoint is because often to write two or more good melodies we have to form an incomplete chord. 

What if both of our melodies needed to go to A to sound good instead of E? Well that's one reason why we use the voicing A C A. Counterpoint is very freeing because you can have weird voicings for the sole reason 'it makes a good melody'. 

You might also have to use A C A specifically for good voice leading. That's another topic. If you're interested in counterpoint, the YouTube channel Alan Belkin is very useful. The book 'Counterpoint in Composition' is too.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Your concept of tonality is a little misguided. If a song revolves around and emphasises one particular <b><u>harmony</u></b> (in this instance C major) it is still in that key. 

Think about Beethoven's Für Elise. It is in A minor but there are a number of non diatonic chords. It remains in A minor (except for modulation) 

So just because we see some non diatonic notes and chords doesn't mean we are no longer in the key of C (in this instance). 

Your E major is functioning as a secondary dominant. 

HTH
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Can you tell us exactly what notes you were using in the chords you are unsure of?

If you are using G7 you are probably resolving to C minor (in this instance it sounds like minor).

However you ask what kind of <b><u>harmony</u></b> is being implied-this doesn't make much sense. Every chord is it's own <b><u>harmony</u></b>, thus there are multiple harmonies. And if you are playing the whole chord you aren't implying <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you are outright supplying it. 

So, can you clarify what you mean?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>It is a little confusing, notation would help but let me work with what we have got and bare in mind I learnt and play within Baroque not jazz. I'm ignoring extensions:
Chord 1 is Cm7, without the fifth
Chord 2 is Bbmajor, not minor. 
Chord 3 you said is D minor
Chord 4 is Emajor7
Chord 5 is G minor as you said
Chord 6 is G7. 

The <b><u>harmony</u></b> is pretty weird, enshelled within a logical V-i. I can't really analyse the E major. 

You are wrong about chords by the way. A chord only ever has 3-4 notes that it 'owns'. It has a root, third, fifth and a possible 7th. Anything else is an extension. 

In your C minor you omitted the fifth. That's fine. The relationship between C-Eb is the identifying interval of that chord. The Bb is the 7th. 

Message me if you need clarification.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Cool! - if you wrote a leap into a dissonance that you can't sing accurately, the way to turn it into a vocal line is to use a suspension.

In fact it is likely that suspensions came about because when music was vocally based, it was too hard to leap into a dissonance. Someone must have asked: 'What if the <b><u>harmony</u></b> changed around the consonant note to make it dissonant?'

And then the suspension was born
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I just commented a similar answer to another person but one redditor once said that the most logical place to start is with two part species counterpoint.

The reason why is because it combines the study of voice leading, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and to some extent actually writing a melody.

To my knowledge most people don't begin here. It is laddened with rules, it can be overwhelming... Etc
Instead they begin by learning songs they like and slowly expanding their knowledge.

However, if you want to learn species counterpoint you could pick up the book 'Counterpoint in Composition', and/or 'Gradus ad Parnassum'. You would need to be able to read music first.

Good luck!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You seem confused about baroque <b><u>harmony</u></b>. This isn't it's own vertical sonority in baroque music. Maybe it is in jazz, but I haven't studied jazz.
We build triads from thirds, thus 1,3,5,(7) is the maximum amount of notes that can claim their own vertical identity. 

So there is no such thing as a 9th <b><u>harmony</u></b> in baroque. Also note how we can't voice what is known as a C9 chord and abide by the conventions of baroque voice leading. In every scenario you end up with poor or outright wrong voice leading. Baroque music runs a tight ship and there is no room for extended triads. 

You may encounter C G D - B G D
Here we have a 9-10 suspension in the bass voice. This is one of the proper uses of the interval of a ninth in baroque music.

Someone else could explain this better than me so seek them out.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ja you can do as you wish, if you are playing G7sus2 with only the notes 

G D F A

Your are omitting the vital note B, which forms a tritone with F, which is what gives the V chord so much direction. And as you know the 3rd also gives the chord its defining quality.

Now you might not want that directional sound... In this instance you might want to use the something else. 

Ultimately you pick and choose what you want. If you want clear functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> you may wish to use the G7. 
If you are using it at the end of the piece, common practice tells us that's the best place to really state the tonality.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Classical Era, because that's where we start seeing these formal functions

Not the baroque era? If anyone synthesised the idea of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> &amp; composition could we not say it was Bach?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br><b><u>Harmony</u></b> and melody are not similar. Melodies aren't usually an octave higher than chords depending on the music you listen to. 

<b><u>Harmony</u></b>, simply put, derives from the vertical relationship between notes. A melody is a structure usually comprised of various motifs. At the very least a melody will have an identity and contour that sets it aside from a bass line for example. A melody may or may not outline sensible <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I've decided to write a little to challenge some of the poor answers I have seen here.

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> and melody are not one and the same. The distinction to be made comes from a melody possessing characteristics that draw focus to it. As in motifs, and contour. Now not all melodies have this I'm sure. Generally they will... 

<b><u>Harmony</u></b> comes from the vertical stacking of intervals. The notes that form <b><u>harmony</u></b> needn't draw as much attention. 

However... If you study counterpoint, then we combine the two ideas, we construct 'independent' melodies that possess the characteristics of a good melody and together outline sensible <b><u>harmony</u></b>.

For example, take the little fugue in G minor by Bach, there are a number of melodies in the piece at any one moment, and how they relate forms <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 

Hth
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The bass is such a limited instrument that I'd imagine it being your only instrument rather frustrating.

If you persist with it, I'd definitely say learn your scales but do it as a formula. C major and G major are the same construct, the major scale is just a pattern that can be applied to any note to make it the tonic.

Learn your intervals, which intervals are consonant or dissonant...

And to learn functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is crucial too. Just these three things will put you miles ahead, and with the proper resources they are very possible to learn quickly.

Let me know if you want any suggestions for books or channels.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm unsure of what you wrote here.
If you look at the structure and purpose of melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> they are not at all similar.

&gt;They both can create fundamental backbones of a song!

I take issue with this too. The melody is not the backbone - it is the most fundamental unit, arguably. The backbone (aka supporting structure) is the <b><u>harmony</u></b> which gives context to a melody.

Obviously, in counterpoint every line is both fundamental and supporting. 

I'm not saying this to be predantic. But I would be open to further discussion on this topic if you wholly disagree. All the best.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;I'd say there are more than just melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> to music writing

Did I say otherwise? 

&gt;can't I say that I like this certain chord change?

Yes you can, again did I say you couldn't?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm not a jazz musician but I would say before you begin the experimentation of modes and other scales, that you first master major and minor.

Remember the major and minor scales are the formula we impose on any note to derive functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Thus learning a scale should be a matter of recognising the patterns and simply familiarising yourself with the new positions.

Hand independence and accuracy comes with time, so keep at it.

Also remember that when improvising you can only produce what you already know. When you expand your knowledge further and further, your improvisations can grow more and more elaborate. All the best.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I don't understand this, can you expand on it? 

Building chords and intervals is very basic stuff. Once you internalise it you move on to larger topics that approach real life composition (such as voice leading and melody writing and functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, that you can then improvise around).

What I'm trying to say is that, for me, learning to compose in an improvisation is what I learnt 'by heart'. Building chords &amp; intervals was a pedagogical tool that serves as a foundation of music. I guess you have to learn everything by heart to improvise.

I may have missed the point you are making, in which case, I'd appreciate you elaborating on it
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Good work Xeno! I think it is really generous of you to rewrite this with counterpoint.

To OP, note that the voices have different rhythmic identities. The voice leading is good and the <b><u>harmony</u></b> sensible.

At the same time the individual melodies are a marked improvement and their contours are good, nor is there is leaps across the bar lines.

This makes for an excellent opportunity to study two part counterpoint. And that leading tone suspension! Someone has done their homework!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you want to see the most obvious relationship between melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you could study counterpoint. 
Counterpoint combines multiple melodic lines simultaneously which produce 'chords'. This is an oversimplification of the concept. 

The books I recommend are:

Fux's Gradus 

Counterpoint in Composition 

The YouTube channels:

Alan Belkin's applied counterpoint 

JJ Berthume

artofcounterpoint 


Also, take time to study the works of great composers, or just anyone you like really. Melodies often have very apparent structures, comprised of small melodic ideas called motifs, and in the hands of a composer like Bach we can easily see the weaving together of small ideas into larger structures. 

I could go on and on... but it is better to actually read and study works then to hear some dude yammering on!
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Trouble here is the best way of learning melodic ideas requires learning how great composers wrote their melodies, which requires you to read music.

I could give you a number of guidelines, but will they mean anything? I'll try.

A good melody tends to possess a good contour. 
Leaps will be recovered, there is a variety of rhythmic values. 
You shouldn't leap to a dissonance with the melody. And you should be wary of continuing stepwise motion in any one direction for too long... 
You don't want a static area. You don't want a disconnected area. 
And the 'rule of the little notes'...

Really these are just a bunch of abstract guidelines until you see how composers wrote within them and took the liberty to break them. 

Most melodies are comprised of motifs that are developed in interesting ways. E.g sequences, extensions, inversions and even retrograde... Etc
Many melodies outline sensible <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Simply put, writing counterpoint is another way to compose. It presents a variety of new options, and has a very different texture because often the focus constantly shifts from one voice to another. 

For example Mozart's K545 is not contrapuntal. There is one clear melody supported by broken chords. 
In counterpoint, let's take Bach's Fugue 2 in C minor, we have multiple melodies. It's a very different texture, which you may find interesting. 

A countermelody is a melody that compliments the 'main' melody, usually through contrast. See also 'subject' and 'countersubject'. 

When we have two melodies we are also presented with vertical sonorities that suggest <b><u>harmony</u></b>/chords.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>A while ago another commenter answered this question with 'species counterpoint is the logical place to begin'. I agree, if you are indeed serious about learning music. 

It is challenging but with the right resources and time it is a great tool to learn to compose (as you said you want to) and to delve into some of the complexities of theory... like voice leading, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody writing

I recommend the YouTube channel Alan Belkin - applied counterpoint

And the books:

Counterpoint in Composition

Fux's Gradus ad Parnassum (the study of counterpoint) 

Hth
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You can sing any note of the chord. You can also sing notes that don't belong to the chord as long as the function is clear. 
You don't just want to sing the root though. The voice is a melodic instrument, and only singing chord tones will be boring. We enjoy dissonance when it is correctly used. If you want me to expand on that I can message you. 

The reason it sounds good is because it is  consonant with the underlying <b><u>harmony</u></b>. 
Try also the passing tone, the neighbour tone and the suspension.

As you develop as a musician you will also find the singing the root only will produce errors of voice leading. It is also not ideal from a purely melodic perspective. So learn how to sing dissonances too. All the best.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>As others pointed out two part writing is not a vocal melody and an accompanient.

Two part writing is two distinct lines that are played simultaneously and together form logical <b><u>harmony</u></b> whilst retaining their own identity. 

If you want to get into that, Bach wrote fifteen two part 'inventions' for students. They make for good pieces to study. 

My tip to you is to pick up a book on counterpoint, watch videos on counterpoint, and to learn pieces written in counterpoint. You will need to read music. All the best.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm going to try and tackle a concern you raised in your post. 

I think this is a good question because when I began reading music and writing music I would try and write down what I did when at the piano and realise I had no idea how to organise the rhythmic denominations. How could I tell if I were writing a quarter note or an eighth etc?

What helped me was studying rhythmic figures. It's quite easy to write out every one beat figure. Then you just extend that idea, if you can write one beat, you can write a measure. Etc
Then write out the more complex rhythmic figures, where notes don't fall on beats... Can you write out a staggered entry, can you write a suspension? What about a decorated suspensions?  Try writing all that stuff so you become fluent. 

Now to answer your question, I will usually begin by improvising, the time signature is one of the first things to be readily apparent, and when writing out the rhythms it then becomes obvious what everything should receive to belong to that time signature. 
To answer another part of your question: I write in counterpoint, this means I don't have to worry about what note is <b><u>harmony</u></b> and which is the melody because the voices function as both at the same time. I only write for one piano too so I don't have to think 'maybe I'll give the horns this note...'
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Change the Dminor7 to D7 and send that son-bitch to G minor.

Not necessarily though. What key are you in? And what kind of cadence do you want? You have a number of choices... 

By the way you can keep the Dmin7 and still go to a G minor. The way to know what your options in this situation are and any other, is to learn functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>The answers so far should be taken with skepticism, because some of them are complete nonsense.

You've provided us a goal of 'somber' but there is no formula in music as to how to portray emotion. 

Simply put, you have to be a good enough composer to know how to create what you have in mind.

And how do you reach that stage? You have to study <b><u>harmony</u></b>, and how to construct a melody line. You should also, and I cannot stress this enough, be studying the works of other musicians if you aspire to be a composer. 

If you want to be a composer, you have to study. What you learn from your study is your sandbox that you can construct music with.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Harmonic field?
Does this mean you have studied functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>?

You could move on to the study of voice leading.... 

Or, counterpoint (kill two birds with one stone because the study of counterpoint combines both the study of <b><u>harmony</u></b> and voice leading).
I can recommend books and YouTube channels for this topic. Also see the sidebar 

Don't forget to learn actual music too. If you are just learning these topics in the abstract it isn't particularly fun nor do their relationships to composition become apparent.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>OK well the question 'how do I write a melody' is a bit loaded and most composers tend to write a melody first and write <b><u>harmony</u></b> as a result of it. 

Anyway, I recommend as you are beginning you keep things simple. Use mostly simple rhythms, and have a few melodic motifs within the melody

Make the melodic contour as interesting as possible. Again as you are just beginning I would urge you to not use too many compositional idioms until you are sure how to use them correctly. 
And study the work of others. Get yourself some scores.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There aren't one or two books that cover everything. 

The most detailed book I know is 'Counterpoint in Composition' which explores counterpoint, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, voice leading and touches on rhythm. 
It covers elementary counterpoint and prolongued counterpoint well and is an excellent text for the would-be composer. 

It also presents and analyses the work of great composers. So bonus.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>If you want the music to sound smooth (as oppose to the way you play) you need to understand voice leading.

You would do well to study <b><u>harmony</u></b> if you haven't already.

There are books that I can recommend but they depend on you reading music. 

Unfortunately I can't condense the study of voice leading and <b><u>harmony</u></b> into a reddit comment... and I'm not sure what 'vibey' means.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Can you provide a link to the piece

 or tell us the context...

E.g

What is the underlying <b><u>harmony</u></b> at that moment in time?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You're going to have to fight your ADHD ya know. 

I would urge you to study <b><u>harmony</u></b>, voice leading and counterpoint.
The good news is that they all relate. So don't be afraid. 

I recommend the texts 'Gradus Ad Parnassum' &amp; 'Counterpoint in Composition'.

Gradus Ad Parnassum is a text by Fux who tried to replicate the rather strict voice leading of a composer named Palestrina. The text is written in a teacher-student manner. 

Counterpoint in Composition is an excellent book on counterpoint that combines all the practices of composers, with a lot of Bach!

And the YouTube channel: Alan Belkin - applied counterpoint. The episodes are short and of good quality (he talks you through them well)

You referred to gamifying things... How about a 'mission'? Write an exercise in what we refer to as 'species' counterpoint* and post it on this sub. We can take a look at it, and if necessary offer constructive support.

*Species counterpoint is a pedagogical tool to get students to work through voice leading and counterpoint. You will want to start with first species and progress to five.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt;Is <b><u>harmony</u></b>, voice leading, and counterpoint basically the whole thing where instruments can't match vocals and vice versa?

I'm not too sure what that means! If you listen to the two and three part inventions by Bach you can have an idea of what real life counterpoint is and what it sounds like. E.g Check out sinfonia no. 2 by Bach. 

&gt;Which of the two might be better to start with?

I'd say whichever you feel more inclined towards. Composers of both era used counterpoint. I think, however, that baroque music presents matters of voice leading and counterpoint in a way that is much clearer. 

&gt;pedagogical

This refers to teaching. Species counterpoint is a pedagogical tool (a tool for teaching counterpoint) because you wouldn't actually compose in species counterpoint.  It's military training. 

Bach wrote his two part inventions and three part sinfonias for his students! And still students learn them today and for good reasons. He wrote a very endearing little preface to the collection which explains his motives:

'Forthright instruction, wherewith lovers of the clavier, especially those desirous of learning, are shown in a clear way not only 1) to learn to play two voices clearly, but also after further progress 2) to deal correctly and well with three obbligato parts, moreover at the same time to obtain not only good ideas, but also to carry them out well'

Which is why I recommend them!

Otherwise:
Books: Fux's Gradus
Counterpoint in Composition 

Develop your sight reading too. Get some simple music to learn on, grade 1 stuff. This will help you in the long run, you'll learn more pieces at a faster rate and it will also allow you to quickly learn from whatever piece you play.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I'm unsure of the curriculum in the UK. I doubt they'll teach you anything outside of Western 'high art' music, or whatever they call it.

E.g I presume you'll be learning notation, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, counterpoint, form, etc

Or just some of these. That's the curriculum elsewhere. I can't imagine it will be wildly different in the UK
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>By learning Bach pieces, and reading Fux's Gradus ad Parnassum... and a different text called 'Counterpoint in Composition'

Combined I learnt all about voice leading, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, motific development, fugue etc from this.

It was not easy and the learning process continues, and many times I thought I would never understand something, but all things yield with time.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Hi u/briandress

One thing I regret when initially trying to learn music was that I had no good resources for learning practical composition. 
I'm concerned you may fall into the same trap as I and others once did if you focus on learning shapes and patterns. 

That's a laborious method for memorising your instrument, but you have a young child and thus you need to make the most of the time you have to spare. Correct? 

I always suggest this to other people.. . If you want to at some point compose your own pieces or learn pieces by great composers like Bach (as oppose to four chord rock) ... I would urge you to study counterpoint. Why? It teaches voice leading, <b><u>harmony</u></b> &amp; melody. It's a no nonsense approach, everything you learn from counterpoint can be used in composition. Comparably, knowing an endless amount of positions is not useful. 

I can message you some resources if you want.  Regardless, I wish you the best with your study.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Not the original commenter... 

There's no answer to that question! It depends on how much time per day you can spend learning - If you effectively apply yourself to your study and work hard, it could be a matter of 6 months to a year to be able to sight read and to understand <b><u>harmony</u></b> and even applied counterpoint.

You will not be a virtuoso in six months, but you could potentially be a good musician in that time. And once you get the foundations accomplished (reading music, functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, species counterpoint ...) it is 'up and up' from there.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Absolutely.

But here's the problem:

Spending a lot of time on something doesn't guarantee that you are making the best use of that time. 

'studying theory' could also encompass some rather esoteric subjects that aren't of much use  in real life music. It's therefore a good idea to have a teacher who can identify what must be learnt, from that which is unessential. From my own experience, the areas of theory that you need to understand are functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>, voice leading and counterpoint. You absolutely need to be able to read music to understand these concepts. 

Along the way you need to learn lots of actual music to give you an idea of the possibilities in compositions. 

Remember also that old maxim: 'drops where away the stone, not by strength, but by constant falling'. This is something that you have to keep at, relentlessly. There may well be days where it feels overwhelming, but you have to persist in spite of that.

Lastly, we have some teachers and professors on this subreddit who could talk about what worked for their own students. I'm sure they'll be happy to expand on this, so why not seek some of them out? 

All the best.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is why I don't read YouTube comments. The lack of common decency is awful. 

I cannot think of too many significant advantages to being a composer besides that a musician with perfect pitch can learn complex pieces quicker, which gives them greater scope to compose with. They can probably be more prolific too and quickly generate ideas. 

However the composer without who has studied <b><u>harmony</u></b>, counterpoint, form and ear training would be able to be just as prolific too.

A musician without perfect pitch can still write brilliant music. Wagner, Stravinsky and Brahms were great composers. Thus it is obvious that any advantages the composer with perfect pitch has, the composer without can attain by careful study.

I'm not an expert on this and I welcome contrasting views to mine.

Some things in your harp writing are unplayable, however. In the slow part, specifically. You have to think that at any given point, the harp can only play seven given notes (each tone of the scale being natural, sharp, or flat) and the alteration will be the same on all octaves. This means, for example, that you cannot have a passage that goes B-flat, B-nat, B-flat, B-nat, it's just unfeasible unless it is amazingly slow. 

This is because harps work with pedals that set each tone to its position. It is possible to change that tuning while the piece is progressing, but you need to give the harpist at least *some* time to do it. There are ways to circumvent this, but this often leads to harpists playing enharmonics that wouldn't be correct if they were given to any other instrument.

Since harps cannot have double-flats or -sharps my advice is always to place where your naturals are, fix those as required tunings, and work around the rest to see what could work. Start by mapping what natural notes you need or might need based on what you want. Don't forget to consider F and C as enharmonics of E# and B#, respectively. Write them all down. Then see if anything around that doesn't work. If that's the case, try to find a pattern of enharmonics that works. A good rule of thumb is to allow one bar in a tempo such as that of your slow section to allow for pedal changes to ensure that amateur harpists can do it too. Of course, some will be able to do it faster, but with things like these you should try and work for the less experienced player.

For instance, your passage in bars 106-113 is unplayable because it requires quite a few extremely quick pedal changes which aren't humanly possible (looking at you in particular, G# to G-nat gesture).

I've rewritten that passage in another manner so you see the kind of thing that I mean. Now there's only one quick pedal change which should be manageable (it's in bold in my rewriting). It would still be better if the last beat of bar 107 didn't have a D, but that's up to you (I think having G-B(Cb)-G(low) would work too).

You can find my rewriting here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/f6tye71gxz46p3g/Harp.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f6tye71gxz46p3g/Harp.jpg?dl=0) Sorry for the engraving, it was done very quickly on a trial version of <b><u>Harmony</u></b> Assistant since I'm not close to my gear at the moment. Some other passages a bit later also have similar issues.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>A reliable resource of <b><u>harmony</u></b> online?

Definitely Alan Belkin's [Modern <b><u>Harmony</u></b> course series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSntcNF64SVXzsZiYybBTVcpKCiOEqH_m). It starts with more or less basic stuff and works up. Belkin is a very well-known and excellent Canadian educator who has been teaching at the University of Montreal for years. Several of my friends went to study there specifically to be taught by him. He also has other excellent YouTube series you should watch.

Your updated version is better than the original, that's for sure. It's not great great, but it's definitely an improvement! As you study and learn more you'll be able to do more. Keep up the good work!
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>Melody Assistant doesn't (didn't?) have the possibility to export xml files, only import them, and since I never bought a license for <b><u>Harmony</u></b> Assistant my only option was to basically transcribe everything by hand in Finale (faster than adjusting midi files, most of the time). That's fine because I did a big cleansing of my catalogue at that time, rewrote passages, and sometimes downright reorchestrated entire works (hello there, young works of when I didn't know what I was doing).

However, to this day I still MUCH prefer how Melody/<b><u>Harmony</u></b> Assistant import midi files over Finale. That's the only reason why my current computer still has Melody Assistant installed.

That being mostly vocal part writing. But even then it is more a suggestion than a rule. For example if you have sopranos singing melody and altos singing <b><u>harmony</u></b>, you won't usually let the altos sing a higher note than the sopranos.

In instrumental writing, or music less focused on counterpoint, this will be even less important.  

You can also use this "rule" in the reverse direction. If you are analyzing what is happening in a solo piano piece or solo guitar piece (or Bach's solo violin music), the higher notes will sound like one part, the medium notes will sound like one part, etc.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>No. I would say that it sometimes does. Aurally we distinguish different part/voices through a variety of means including timbre, rhythm, volume, and of course register.

You don't want to neglect any of these elements.

For example Carcassi Etude op 60 no 3 has a single instrument playing one note at a time implying 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b>. No voice crossing. If you did, it would obscure the texture.

Mozart violin sonata k301 in measure 7 and 8 the violin melody dips below the piano accompaniment. Not a big deal with a melody/chord texture and instruments with contrasting timbres.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>There are several reasons as I understand it. He is not only *the* baroque composer, but was hugely influential on almost every major composer after him from Mozart and Beethoven on up to Shostakovich.

He also has a large body of works that are well suited for student study. One of the main reasons for studying Bach is the chorales. A large selection of well written chorales in 4 part <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Excellent for studying part writing, harmonization, voice leading, etc. He has contrapuntal works from simple 2 part pieces designed for beginners on up to dazzlingly intricate multi voice works. Every possible contrapuntal manipulation can be found in his masterworks.

While Bach did not write a theory books per se, many of his compositions are considered text books by themselves. Goldberg, art of fugue, inventions, etc.

Although Bach did not write a theory book, his son CPE Bach (one of his children) did. The True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments (half of which is about theory and composition) was studied by all the great composers.


</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>They do resolve. The prevailing <b><u>harmony</u></b> is an F major chord. The C's are chord tones, and the Bb's are lower neighbor tones. They just happen to be accented.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Analyzing the melodies that you transcribe is a great idea. Definitely at least scale degrees and relationship to the prevailing <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Intervals can help also.

As for functional ear trainer, it has an advanced mode where you can set multiple notes after each cadence. You can also set it where it doesn't play the cadence as often. But at some point you should definitely switch over to transcribing/analyzing tunes.

Also highly recommend the Developing Musicianship through Improvisation series by Christopher Azzara.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Also, analyze the melody in terms of harmonic and non-harmonic tones relative to the prevailing <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>You already know intervals, triads, 7th chords, and inversions? And all of the lessons on musictheory.net? Applying all of that to analyzing music is another good place to go. Also 4-part <b><u>harmony</u></b> writing and species counterpoint.

2. Improving your relative pitch (http://www.eartraininghq.com/scale-degrees-the-most-important-tool-for-developing-relative-pitch/)

3. Remembering the formulas for different chord types and scale types.

4. Understanding functional tonal <b><u>harmony</u></b> and counterpoint.

5. Seeing patterns and commonalities regardless of the current key.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I used Piston's <b><u>harmony</u></b> textbook and workbook on my own (wasn't a big fan of the theory book used in my college curriculum). Enjoyed it, but can't compare to the others. I used Tonal Counterpoint by Thomas Benjamin for counterpoint and I think Adler for orchestration.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Because in Common Practice music, HARMONIES in minor are built from the HARMONIC minor scale. The leading tone along with the tritone between scale degree 4 and 7 help establish the key center more strongly and are what functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is based on.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>In the context of Common Practice music, the best way to think of it is not as separate scales (and definitely not as ascending vs descending).

Scale degree 6 and 7 are variable. When over the dominant <b><u>harmony</u></b> you will use the raised 7. Often over the tonic <b><u>harmony</u></b> you will also use raised 7.

When going between scale degree 6 and the raised 7, you will usually use the raised 6 to avoid the augmented 2nd (unless specifically trying to evoke that exotic sound). The lowered 6 will be used with the lowered 7 or with 5.

There are direction tendencies, but it has more to do with harmonies.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Interesting way of looking at it. But what do you get if you use that method with negative <b><u>harmony</u></b>?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>[Alan Belkin](http://alanbelkinmusic.com/site/en/index.php/introduction/) has some great free composition and counterpoint textbooks.

</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yeah. A lot of rounds are basically just triad <b><u>harmony</u></b> with some basic nonharmonic tones. Frere Jacques also. Still more than just 1,2,3 and 5.

Can't think of anything else that just uses 1, 2, 3 and 5. Can you name one?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Yes. Usually <b><u>harmony</u></b> first. 4 part voice leading, then counterpoint.

The David Fuentes book has some great stuff, but assumes you already know a bit. There isn't as much written on melody and rhythm. A lot of that would come from improving your ear.

One thing to think about with melodies is how the notes fit with chords. You should learn the standard uses of nonharmonic tones. Analyzing real music is good also.

I'm a composer. Unfortunately not a professional one at the moment since I'm only 17 but my biggest dream is to become a full time composer and because I've been practicing theory and composition for a long time, I think my advice could be of use to you. First of all, take theory lessons if you haven't before and if your knowledge of theory is very basic. If not, try advancing your knowledge further by studying COUNTERPOINT. Learning and studying counterpoint really changes the way you write as a composer. It did for me at least. Learn about things like figured bass, counterpoint, Romantic era <b><u>harmony</u></b> (Augmented sixths, neopolitan chords, unresolved dominant ninth chords and unresolved cadences in general such as those found in Wagner, chromatic mediant modulations and modulations in general, diminished chords and secondary dominants and stuff like that), Modality(Ioninan,dorian etc.), Modes of limited transposition(Octatonic, whole-tone), Polytonality and 20th century devices like these in general, what form is and how to use basic and then more complicated forms(this is very importnat in my opinion, as it brings everything together). Then learn about roman numeral analysis and try analyzing your favorite pieces to understand how they function. Yes, there are specific teachers for composition but finding one outside of a conservatory campus might be difficult. You can look for advanced music theory teachers in your area though. As for youtube channels focusing on classical composition, I recommend Nahre Sol, Rick Beato for theory, Alan Belkin, Samuel Andreyev and DAVID BRUCE COMPOSER (written in caps because I think his channel is an amazing resource for composers). If you have anything more to ask, do feel free to do so because I love talking about these things if you haven't been able to tell already:).
</p></li></ol></div><hr><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">User: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/saichoo>saichoo</a><ol><li><p><b>GaryBurtonImprov</b><br>Here's what I wrote in the forums:

It's a shame that Gary didn't mention this as this is specifically in the realm of jazz <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I will try to explain why these intervals are used (the more experienced can correct me if needed!).

So:

9th = 2nd
11th = 4th
13th = 6th

Why are there intervals larger than an octave?
When you see a chord symbol, there are usually 7 "good" notes you can play during that symbol. So if we have a Dmin7 chord, the first 4 good notes you can play are the chord tones: D, F, A, C (root, 3rd, 5th, 7th). Notice that these notes are a 3rd apart. Because chords are usually built in 3rds, if you continue going up in 3rds, you get E, G, B (9th, 11th, 13th). When you arrange these notes into a scale, you get D, E, F, G, A, B, C (D Dorian). It's easier to think of the Dorian mode than needing to think "I've got a Dmin7 and I can also play the 9th, 11th, 13th." But the main thing to take away is that the scale is built from the chord.

You often see chord symbols sometimes using the smaller intervals (2nd, 4th, 6th) and sometimes using the larger intervals (9th, 11th, 13th). Major 7th and Minor chords tend to use the smaller intervals, whereas Dominant 7th chords tend to use the larger intervals.

Hope this helps.

</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Commonly used chord progressions in tonal music:

- up a 4th (down a 5th) e.g. V-I, I-IV
- down a 3rd (up a 6th) e.g. I-VI, VI-IV
- up a 2nd (down a 7th) e.g. I-II, IV-V

The reverse of these tend to be weaker progressions e.g. up a 3rd.

Info from this: http://www.<b><u>harmony</u></b>.org.uk/book/dynamic_<b><u>harmony</u></b>.htm
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Running through all keys everyday is quite time consuming and can get very boring. If you can do Charlie Parker hours then fine, but I find that applying the techniques to tunes helps internalize the technique.

For instance, Stella by Starlight. I can play the LH voicings almost without thinking now and I can kinda solo on it. I can probably play an Em7b5 to A7alt very easily, probably without thinking now. Without applying this technique to a tune, it is unlikely that I would find it as easy to play as I do now. 

If you pick tunes that are all in different keys, you will learn a lot of voicings and scales etc. And if you pick tunes in similar keys, you'll be able to learn them quicker. (Everything I'm learning seems to be in F, or Bb darn it. Blues for Alice, Have You Met Miss Jones, Bye Bye Blackbird, Someday My Prince Will Come, Stella by Starlight).

For a few days I was playing Stella in C instead of Bb and it helped me gain a new perspective on the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, because I find it very easy to see the harmonic relationships in C ("Oh, it starts on a #4 chord. Weird!").

As for the nuts and bolts of transposing, I use two methods. Because I am familiar with all the major and minor keys from classical playing, I can think 3-5-6-2(9) and do it with not too many problems from key to key. The second method I find even more of a shortcut. Because I've been learning solfege recently, I can think Mi-So-La-Re and apply it to any key. It helps when reading examples because most examples are in C. I say the solfege names of the chord and can easily transfer it to Gb.

I think what also helped me was that I used to do vocal covers of songs, and became very adept at transposing chords for my range (I'm a bass so every male pop song must be transposed).

This of course takes time to learn. I'm sure others will have some better methods other than "learn all your scales!"

EDIT: As for classical piano, transposing isn't really done. As with my Stella example above, it would probably help to see the piece in a new light. But it's something more for composers.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Yep a teacher helps a lot in this area.

The thing with teaching oneself anything is that very often you have to create your own syllabus i.e. what to learn. Not only that, you have to decide in which order to learn them too. When you're first starting out, you have absolutely no knowledge of what and where to start so a teacher is invaluable in this regard.

Having said that, a good place to start is to list your goals for the piano. Even better is to list all the pieces you want to learn. Don't be afraid of being ambitious. Now once you've written that down, you're going to have to do some more research and investigation, because the pieces you've written down are likely to be very difficult for you. You need a bunch of pieces that progressively lead up to the pieces you want to play, otherwise you'll risk burning out by doing several months on a hard piece with nothing to show for it. A teacher comes in handy here because they know how to keep you making music whilst your technique is still developing. There are syllabi from exam boards such as [ABRSM](http://shop.abrsm.org/shop/syllabus/ABRSM-Piano-2013-2014-Grade-1/12406/167/1) that list pieces in progressive difficulty (grade 1-8 for ABRSM). And if you're not into classical music then there is nothing out there that is standardised.

But anyway, if you somehow manage to make this list, then it has many of the ingredients you'll need in order to have a structure to your learning. Since the pieces are in order of difficulty, there's no question of what to learn next. And with each piece, you can learn a lot from them. Learning the scales and arpeggios in the key of the piece removes the question of what scales and arpeggios to practise. Learning the <b><u>harmony</u></b>, structure, rhythms, unfamiliar musical symbols and working out a suitable choreography in order to make this piece happen.

Good luck.

</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Depends what style/genre you want to improvise in. It's more of a vocabulary/language thing than anything else. For instance, improvising in Funk vs Impressionist style require vastly different musical ideas in melody, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and rhythm. Identify what style you want to improvise in will give you a direction and inform you as to what things you should learn next. 
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Are you singing as well? I assume this is the case.

The technical term for this in jazz in called ["comping"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comping). I have no formal training in this, but from my experience over the years, accompanying yourself with solo piano means you have to cover a lot of the bases of rhythm, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and melody to make the accompaniment sound complete. So not only you have to play the correct chords, but the rhythmic aspect of what you're doing is important to recreate the rhythmic feeling of the original song, so you kind of have to fill the roles of bass guitar and drum set, depending on the genre of the song.

So you got to listen to the original song. Copy the piano parts if there are any, if not the guitar and bass guitar part. Listen to piano singer-songwriters like Elton John and Billy Joel for ideas. Listen to youtube piano and voice covers for ideas. You'll often hear certain tricks of the trade like filling in space between vocal lines with a small melody in the piano, or playing the same rhythm in the piano and voice to emphasise certain lines. 
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; Your average listener can't tell whether a song is written in A major, A♭ major or G major.

Incorrect. [Levitin Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levitin_effect). See also Adam Neely's [recent video on A432 at 5:13](https://youtu.be/EKTZ151yLnk?t=5m13s). Sure, they may not be able to adequately name the difference but they will know something is different. Anecdotally, I was playing "Natural Woman" in A and my friend (who is not musically trained) said that it sounded wrong and lower. This is because is was used to the Aretha Franklin version which is in B, whereas I was playing the Carole King version in A.

&gt; Unless you have perfect pitch, assigning specific shades of brightness to specific keys doesn't make any sense.

Personally, the keys for me have a different "flavour" to each other. No doubt the timbre of the instrument(s) will affect this flavour as well as the type of <b><u>harmony</u></b>/scale that is used as well as the tessitura of the music. For instance, F Lydian can sound bland and not Lydian and just sounds like C major if not set up correctly, whereas C Lydian has a definite Lydian flavour immediately. No doubt my differences in perception between these is due to "Tonal Memory" and doing too many piano exercises in C major. 

&gt; However, that also means that when he describes what a specific key sounds like to him, he's essentially only describing his own, personal perception of that key. There's nothing universal about C major or the frequency 523.25 Hz (C5).

Sure it's personal, but it's a misnomer that certain perceptions aren't shared. If you are playing a piano piece in C major to piano students it can sound incredibly boring or at least old hat because every student starts with C major because it's the easiest. If you play a classic styled rock song with a mixture of A Dorian and A minor to a classic rock audience, then the scale and harmonies of that will recall "Stairway to Heaven" and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" amongst other songs. Also, Collier uses Just Intonation techniques in his acappella songs and arrangements and that further exacerbates the differences between the keys.

Personally I feel "brightness" and "darkness" is better suited for timbral differences rather than harmonic differences. For instance, with the voice a deep OO vowel is definitely darker than a bright forward EE vowel, the latter of which has stronger overtones. A Harmon mute on a trumpet creates a thin bright sound, but when Miles Davis uses it on the lower range softly for a ballad, it has this curious quality of being both bright and dark. 
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>&gt; Whenever I learn a piece I just store it in my muscle memory and doing repitition. I that takes a long time and it doesn't really benefit me. I want to be more intimate with the piece. I want to be able to gather ideas so I can get ideas that I can compose or improvise (never been any good at creating things wether it's writing, art, summary, opinion, or composition)

Well you have to analyse the pieces you are working on. This means understanding all the theory behind the piece: harmonic progressions, keys, modulations, rhythms, time signatures, voice leading, form, motifs, themes, counterpoint, timbre, etc. This also means doing your best to find out extra musical things, like what was going on in the composer's life at the time and whether the piece was inspired by other music or other works of art. Who is the piece of music dedicated to? For instance, one of Chopin's Waltzes (Op.69 No.1) was dedicated to a former lover and is nicknamed "L'adieu" for this reason. As an aside, it is easy to forget Chopin's waltzes are actually based off of the dance that is the waltz. Listening to some Johann Strauss waltzes will show you how different a waltz can be.

If you want to compose or improvise you take small sections of works that you particularly like and ask yourself "Why is this passage/section so effective?" Analysing it harmonically, melodically, rhythmically, timbrally, etc. may help with this. Using the same harmonic progression but putting your own melody will help you understand the <b><u>harmony</u></b> better. Playing the section in several different keys will also help you in the improvisation and composition aspect of your musicianship. 
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>With Jazz memorisation it's different from classical. In classical music you aim to memorise every note. With Jazz you memorise the melody and the chords and maybe intros and outros that have become standard. Everything else you play in Jazz is improvised according to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the other instruments.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>&gt; I can identify a range of chords by sight, but when I'm looking at learning a piece that is from a genre that is quite different (say, Pop or Jazz), there are some funky chords in there that derail me. Is repetition the best way to learn these? Or is there some other technique to help me identify the more advanced chords?

Again this is a little bit vague, but if there is a specific piece you're having trouble with understanding the theory of, I can give a more specific answer which tends to apply to other pieces. For instance, [in this video I was watching recently \(at 1:55\)](https://youtu.be/YlF0Hlc6VSg?t=1m55s) he talks about a C7 chord which isn't in the key of D major, the key which the song is in. The following chords are B7 and Emin. Jazz is full of (Roman numerals here) ii-V-I (or i) progressions and in this case B7 is the V chord and Emin would be the i chord but C7 is definitely not a ii chord. But C7 is a tritone away from F sharp and F sharp is the ii chord. By switching the F sharp chord for the C7 chord, you get a tritone substitution. The main reason why a tritone substitution can work is because of chromatic voice leading i.e. the notes of the C7 chord move a half-step down to the B7 chord. He says all this in the video I think.

Phew. If all this stuff is way over your head, I would advise you to go to the /r/musictheory sidebar, start there and ask questions in that subreddit. There is a certain amount of brute force memorisation to this stuff, but I remember when I was teaching myself some jazz theory but I already had a solid basis in classical theory so I could relate what I already knew about classical theory to the jazz theory. Context is your best ally in remembering things. The less abstract something is, the easier it is to remember. 

As for learning chords and inversions, it's tougher to learn this on piano than on the guitar, because there's so many more possibilities to form a basic chord. (The advanced chords on guitar really go over my head though). As is the case with learning most new things, start with the simple then work up the more comfortable you become. Stick with three note chords i.e. triads with simple rhythms. Folk songs and traditional tunes are good for this because they have strong melodies and usually simple chords and chord progressions. Pop music is also good for this, though some pop music has more funky <b><u>harmony</u></b> that you may find difficult to grok.

Remembering my process for learning this, I was in a band with friends who knew little theory, and I had to translate and often transpose the various theoretical bits so that they could understand how to play the tune. I was also interested in singing and songwriting and the necessity to accompany myself made me learn the required skills for this. I also taught myself guitar because I didn't have a keyboard to lug around to open mics. 

&gt; Simple chords such as major, minor, diminished etc I can identify visually, but when it gets to be something with 5+ notes or inversions, I can sit there and read the notes one by one to build it, but this isn't really useful whilst playing.

This is stuff you usually do away from the piano when analysing the piece. Often with added note chords the most important thing to know is how it functions, and for function you need only to know the basic triad and what is before and after the chord. Added notes tend to be "flavour" rather than function. So I could have a G minor 11 to a C7sharp9 to a F major 7 sharp 4 but the basic function is still G minor-C major-F major i.e. ii-V-I. 

But when you do add more notes, knowing your intervals really well helps the process a lot faster, so instead of thinking of individual note names for each chord, you are thinking in terms of how the notes relate to the root note intervallically. Knowing what the root is is very important no matter what inversion it is.

When thinking of intervals larger than the octave, it's helpful to know their equivalents within the octave e.g. in an A flat minor chord, the 4th and the 11th is D flat. What determines whether it's a 4th or 11th is partly convention though there might be an actual reason why this is differentiated in jazz theory, I can't remember at the moment. Usually in I chords it will be called a 4th, but for ii and V chords it will be called an 11th.

Similarly 6th and 13th are the same, 2nd and 9th are the same (9th is almost exclusively used, hence it tends to be better to think about them as 9ths). Then you have alterations to those intervals either sharpening them or flattening them, altering the interval by a semi-tone. 

I am struggling to answer this comprehensively as I do not know exactly how I learned this stuff myself. It doesn't always come super quick to me. But being a bass voice and wanting to do covers of pop tunes, I learned to transpose every song I came across and that probably helped me immensely, especially being comfortable in all the keys.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Do you have any long term goals? The more specific the better. If you don't, fantasise. Imagine you had a magic wand that could fulfill any music/piano related goal you want. What would you wish for? Once you have identified that, then you have to reverse engineer and make your medium term goals, short term goals all add up towards getting you to your long term goals. In short, "How do I get from here to there?"

Part of feeling stagnant may be that you may not be challenged enough. It's not only the difficulty of challenges and overcoming them that is rewarding but the fact that it is challenging is stimulating itself because you often have to approach the piano in a completely different way. 

Another thing is that the genre you're making music in has become stale for you. Branch out to different genres and see how that makes you learn melody, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and rhythm differently.

Learn a new instrument! Knowing theory helps learning other instruments faster, plus the experience of having to learn and choreograph new movements to create sound i.e. technique will benefit too.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Nice.

The OST books are still handy for the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and the melodies and the rhythms of any particular tune if you can't be bothered to go through the process of transcribing it yourself. 
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>It's always about the music in the end and what we do in our practise sessions should add up to us being able to play the music we want and in the way we want the music to sound. So, identify your long term goals and desires with music and piano. Don't be afraid to dream. Once you have that big picture in mind, you have to work backwards from there, clarifying medium term goals and short term goals so that the short and medium term add up to the long term goals.

So if there's a particular difficult piece you want to play, you have to learn the physical movements (technique), understand the music (theory) and render it the way you want (improving your ear to be able to discern, understand and discriminate the necessary rhythmic, harmonic, melodic and timbral elements to create the music you want). Say you want to learn Chopin's Fantasie Impromptu in a reasonable timeframe rather than spending a year on it. There's the rhythmic difficulty aspect of it, polyrhythm of 4 over 3, that needs to be understood. Knowing how to hold a steady pulse and being able to play to a metronome exactly is a prerequisite and learning how to subdivide a bar and various simple rhythms prepares you to be able to play the polyrhythm exactly rather than some sort of guess. Knowing how to play arpeggios with large stretches prepares you for the left hand arpeggios. Learning easier Chopin pieces and his contemporaries like Schumann and Mendelssohn helps you to understand his musical language and the way he uses <b><u>harmony</u></b>, melody and rhythm and also the way Chopin physically approached writing pieces. Learning Bach will help you understand the polyphonic aspect of his music. Then the broader aspects of making the melody sing amongst a whole bunch of other notes in the same hand and having the accompaniment present but not overpowering. And so on.

This is one of the reasons why a teacher is useful because they are an excellent time saving device. They do all this work without you having to know or even understand what all this stuff means. If you don't know how to assess your own ability, you learn why it may be difficult as to know where to start. If you decide to not go the teacher route, you have to do all this testing yourself. Reading the syllabuses of various exam boards such as ABRSM, RCM and Trinity and testing out the easy pieces will inform you as to your current ability. Start at grade 1 pieces, have a read through them and see for yourself if there is any difficulty. If after going through a few pieces you find none, then you move on to grade 2. And so on. You'll slowly begin to understand where you current ability lies and what you need to improve on to create the music you want. Adult beginnner methods will also help you assess, though printing public domain sheet music from IMSLP is a lot cheaper.

Knowing all your scales and arpeggios is a must. It is a triple practise - technique, theory and ear combined. Learning how to transpose also tests this knowledge. For instance, how many different keys can you play your pop/rock songs in? If you can do this in all 12 major/minor keys (depending on the song) then you will at that point understand your basic <b><u>harmony</u></b> really well.

Anyway, I hope this gives you some directions of where to explore. Perhaps other pianists who have been in the same position as you can offer what worked for them.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>There are a bunch of transcriptions of solo jazz piano, the two main ones I know of being Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett. You can read and listen and play to see what they do to play and accompany a tune. jazz2511 AKA Doug McKenzie has lots of solo jazz piano on his YouTube.

The main challenge of solo jazz piano I've noticed is that you have to do melody, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and rhythm all yourself. As a mainly classical player, we do this all the time for the whole tune but of course we aren't composing it in real time at the same time. At the same time we are exposed to all sorts of different ways of using the left hand. I've noticed the left hand in combo playing is relegated mainly to a rhythmic role with a secondary harmonic role. I have limited jazz experience so take it with a grain of sea salt.

I've been reading through a transcription of Keith Jarrett's version of Danny Boy. The harmonies are gorgeous and also what has been interesting is how often the initial chord will transform into a slightly different chord a beat later by changing one or two notes. Often it is a suspended chord where the suspended note resolves down and provides extra tension and harmonic impetus.

Walking bass and a stride left hand is also an option for accompaniment in the left hand. 

EDIT: Monk's "Solo Monk" album and "Mingus Plays Piano" are also two good resources. Art Tatum also did a bunch of solo piano.
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>&gt; Why can I easily do it on other instruments, but find so much trouble creating melodies on piano?

Is it just creating melodies? If so, you can improvise on one of your many other instruments and then copy that on the piano. If it's improvising the melody with all the other bits, be it accompaniment, harmonies, rhythms, ostinatos, textures, timbres, then that is a much bigger fishie to fry.

Others have given good advice already: imitating, analysing pieces from various genres and imbibing what they do in melody, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, rhythm, etc. Having a chord progression and knowing the notes (i.e. scales) that lead nicely from chord to chord is a good start to improvising a melody over an accompaniment. This will increase your musical vocabulary. Learning ideas that you like and learning that same idea in all the keys and other permutations will help free you from playing that idea in only one key.

Then there's sharpening the actual improvisation process itself. I have done a lot of improvised theatre and one of the things that my teacher has consistently said is to never have any idea of what you are about to do. Find out from what is onstage. Unfortunately, it is easier to apply this to impro theatre than impro piano because with the theatre you have the other performer(s) and audience and stage to be inspired by. With the piano in the practise room it's the same piano in the same room. But even with this you can experiment with certain parameters. You of course keep throwing away ideas of what you want to play. These ideas are anxiety, they keep you safe because you have something to fall back on when you have an idea. You can also do non-musical interventions, such as placing your hands in the registers of the piano you are unaccustomed to, changing your posture, changing the time of day, rearrange the practise room, moving slowly/quickly towards the piano, playing super flat fingered/super curled, changing the height of the chair, etc.

With the height of the chair idea, yesterday I had a stool lower than Glenn Gould's i.e. very very low and played from this super low position for a while. It was very uncomfortable but I was very surprised by how different the piano sounded. The physical position and the aural difference made me improvise in a way that was different than usual. 
</p></li><li><p><b>piano</b><br>Here's my experience of this, assuming that you are doing only piano and voice. This may be rambling but hopefully there will be some use.

Music can be simplified to melody, <b><u>harmony</u></b> and rhythm. As you are singing, the melody part is taken care of so the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and rhythm part will be mostly taken care of by the piano, although depending on the song the sung part will have a stronger/weaker degree in the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and rhythm areas.

The most basic accompaniment is a bass note in the left hand and a chord in the right hand in the middle register of the piano on every beat. [The Beatles's "Let It Be"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xDzVZcqtYI) is a decent example of this, with various licks with shorter rhythmic notes that lead to the next chord change. Notice that the piano part creates and emphasises the particular rhythmic feel of this song and the whole song could be played and sung by McCartney alone in this way.

A video I did with my friend also exemplifies this. [In addition, in between each line of a lyric, you may have the opportunity to fill in the gap with a short lick as I did here.](https://youtu.be/VOnGm8keSp4?t=54s) In this video you can also hear how I play about with texture and dynamics to emphasise the differences between verse and chorus. The verses are sparser and quieter whereas the choruses are more dense and louder. Also important is how I crescendo towards the choruses. In hindsight I could've used way more licks to fill in the gaps between the vocal lines. It's not that you need loads of them but you do need some melodic interest in the piano part from time to time.

It depends on the voice and how things are mixed in PA/room/recording, but I generally find playing too busily in the register an octave above middle C can take the focus away from the singer to the piano. This depends of course. Playing too busily in general can distract. [For instance in this video, I feel that Oscar Peterson plays way too busily.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ayQq5AQxF0)

Anyway, I hope this helps.
</p></li></ol></div><hr><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">User: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/Kopachris>Kopachris</a><ol><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Sure, I've uploaded them to: http://users.kopachr.is/~chris/music_notes/

"Counterpoint.txt" is Piston's *Counterpoint*. "<b><u>Harmony</u></b>.txt" is Piston's *<b><u>Harmony</u></b>* with introductions from several other books on <b><u>harmony</u></b>. "Species Counterpoint.txt" is the one I've already linked.

I still think it would be worthwhile to read the books, too. There's a lot I *didn't* write down because it seemed either obvious or unimportant to me, but that could be different for you.
</p></li><li><p><b>programming</b><br>The difference between A minor and C major (aside from the fact that the minor scale is altered slightly depending on context) is that in A minor, chords are chosen based on their relationship to the A minor and E major chords, while in C major chords are chosen based on their relationship to the C major and G major chords.

In Western classical music, contrast is primarily created by relating different harmonies to each other over time. On a small scale, this is done by relating different chords in the same tonal framework (key). On a larger scale, this is done by actually changing (modulating) to a different tonal framework (key).

I'd recommend reading Walter Piston's *<b><u>Harmony</u></b>*, Arnold Schoenberg's *<b><u>Harmony</u></b>*, and William Caplin's *Classical Form* for more details.
</p></li><li><p><b>programming</b><br>I'd recommend starting with Piston's *<b><u>Harmony</u></b>*.
</p></li><li><p><b>programming</b><br>Yes, and in harmonic contexts, that's almost always what's used. The reason is that most Western classical music is built primarily on the contrast between the tonic (<b><u>harmony</u></b> built on the first scale degree) and dominant (<b><u>harmony</u></b> built on the fifth scale degree). In particular, the major third above the fifth (i.e. the seventh scale degree) serves as a leading tone back to the tonic (the first scale degree). Composers play on that expectation to get the effect they're looking for. However, a minor chord built on the fifth degree, having a flattened third, lacks that leading tone, and so can't be used as a dominant chord.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Do whatever sounds good, but you should also know that your concept of how melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> work together is flawed, probably limited by your (I'm guessing here) EDM background?

That C blues major scale in your DAW was created by borrowing a couple notes from chords in other keys. Whether you use that for just melody or both melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> depends on whether you want the <b><u>harmony</u></b> to borrow from other keys in the same way, for example if you're modulating to another key.

Your friends' argument is based on a false assumption, that every scale in the world can be generalized to major or minor. Take a look at what /u/65TwinReverbRI wrote, and then go do some more research into music theory, and especially <b><u>harmony</u></b>/tonality.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>&gt; Is it just a total free-for-all, or are there some general rules used in pop/rock/electronic music that limit the choices?

Music is a total free-for-all. :)

The golden rule is, if it sounds good, it is good music. Certain genres have certain features, true, that help us categorize and analyze the music. When you're trying to write music in a particular genre, those features become constraints. Which ones can be bent and which ones can be broken depend on the genre and what your goal is. All in all, though, these aren't meant to be constraints but guidelines based on what other people have found works. Pop, rock, and EDM may seem kind of limited from a music theory standpoint, but if that's the case it's only because audiences like it.

&gt; I have a chord progression written out as i - VI - VII - III in A Minor. If I compose a melody on top of this progression, I can simply use the notes of A Minor. I can probably use A Blues notes for the melody and it will also sound good.

You can use whatever notes you want. You could pull notes from F# major for the melody and C minor for the <b><u>harmony</u></b> if you really want. I don't know what it'll sound like, though, that'll be up to you. Typically, however, melody is derived somehow from the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Even if that's not how you're writing it, that's how the ear interprets it. So when you're adding chromatic notes from your blues scale to the melody, depending on how they're emphasized they could be interpreted as ornaments or they could be interpreted as being significant to the <b><u>harmony</u></b>. If it is interpreted as significant, then what you're really doing is borrowing notes from chords in another key. Depending on where you go with that borrowing, it could just be to spice things up a bit or it could signal modulation (key change).

I'm gonna drop a couple links on you: start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_scale to get a better idea of where your DAW is getting the notes it's calling a blues scale. That'll lead you to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord which has a lot more background about this kind of note-borrowing, which could be more useful in general to your music production. If anything on that page seems a little overwhelming, just start clicking links on whatever you don't understand. Wikipedia has a lot of music theory information, but it's not structured very well and there are a lot of gaps to it. If you have any questions you can't find answers to there, feel free to come back here and ask.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>When performed correctly, I find Tchaikovsky's 4th symphony absolutely exquisite in this regard. Full disclaimer: that is also my absolute favorite piece of music of all time.

Every melody is crafted with perfect care to its subject and altered only to grow its meaning. Each <b><u>harmony</u></b>, each modulation and sequence flows completely naturally, as though the music could go no other way. Where neither melody nor <b><u>harmony</u></b> are altered, either dynamics, articulation, orchestration, or tempo are altered so that I can almost always immediately identify where in the piece I am and what's next if I happen to come into the middle of it.

Perhaps my opinion has been shaped by the fact that I have listened to it hundreds - maybe thousands - of times over the last ten years, though. There was a year in middle school when I would listen to it every night before going to bed.

</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>There are two main structures of writing a melody in western <b><u>harmony</u></b>: A period, and a sentence. A period is essentially a question and an answer. The answer will be the first phrase of the period with a stronger cadential idea at the end of it. A sentence develops a motif. The structure of a sentence is a motif(simple musical idea(think Beethoven's fifth symphony opening, perfect example of a sentence)), then it gets repeated(it can be transformed by transposition or any other method the second time, Beethoven does this a lot). Then you develop your motif by fragmenting it, then you have a cadential idea containing your motif. This comes from a book called "the fundamentals of music composition" by Arnold Schoenberg.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>Mozart wrote over 600 works. He did not write by ear. He knew the music theory of melody, counterpoint, <b><u>harmony</u></b>, form, dynamics, and orchestration well enough for him to do this. Beethoven wrote much less, around half as much but lived much longer and did most of this while deaf. Beethoven broke the rules(more accurately he set new rules) more during the period of time that he was deaf interestingly enough. As you imagine he didn't write by ear either, but his work is often considered to be much more interesting/better, particularly in form and rhythm. Would you rather be Mozart or Beethoven? That is the real question. (also there are diminishing returns to writing lots of music as far as getting better at writing it quickly goes).
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>It isn't that you aren't making controlled music, it is that they come from very different musical cultures and traditions. The word Composer is used to describe classical Composers because of the culture. If you just mix and match the words based off of google definitions or something and think they are all interchangeable you will sound weird. It also isn't about what type of piece or <b><u>harmony</u></b> you write, it is about how you do so. Philip Glass is an example of a composer who composes in a way that is incredibly simple yet he composes it. He writes it down in sheet music to be performed by a group of musicians in a way which fits the cultures and traditions of the story of western classical music. An EDM producer makes more complicated music than minimalism but he does it by slowly adjusting something until he gets it to sound good, it isn't performed by someone else. He may add in some prerecorded drums in a pattern, etc. It isn't composition because the process of making it has literally nothing in common with composition. The only link is that they may add in instruments occasionally and there both music. EDM and Hip hop or electronic music in general has another major difference, intent of making music. This is especially true of users of this subreddit, who are completely obsessed with money. You almost never see a post about money on /r/classicalmusic or /r/composer, and if it is about money, it is about how they cannot make money because YOUR music is popular and ours isn't. Here is a video that better defines what I mean by Intent(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb3hYTWqFAg). Classical music generally fits into the bottom two spheres, art or folk. Lots of classical music is actually just folk dances or church hymns, but that is more for defining really old music because that isn't true anymore.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>When I mean the bottom octave overpowers the top octave, I mean that it overpowers the top octave because violin and viola are playing in unison against just violin. Not because the low register naturally overpowers the high register(although registers overpowering eachother does apply when writing for brass and particuarily woodwind. Read the <b><u>harmony</u></b> in woodwind and <b><u>harmony</u></b> in brass sections of principals of orchestration)
</p></li><li><p><b>ClassicalMemes</b><br>Look up Adam Neely's Jazz Reharmonization and compare the process for figuring out what chord comes next to four part <b><u>harmony</u></b> and partimento. It is much much simpler.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Ahh, the classic music theory equals jazz chords opinion and <b><u>harmony</u></b> opinion. She has many videos on music theory just not what you think it is.
</p></li><li><p><b>ClassicalMemes</b><br>What are you comparing Jazz to then? Pop/rock music? Jazz has a really bland form(particularily bepop) and the melodies are improvised based off of chord progressions as opposed to thematically developed. Also licks are frequently quoted over these chord progressions. The closest proxy to this would be improvising a melody and <b><u>harmony</u></b> based off of a quoted bassline that is thematically developed(Classical improv in baroque and classical period). Which is just much more interesting. Jazz's orchestration is based off of individuals in a particular big band, as opposed to classical orchestration, which is based off of complex series of rules that developed over time. All of this would be find if Jazz hadn't completely dominated the academia in the latter half of the 20th century, as classical music was getting increasingly further from it's roots to the point it can be barely be called classical at all.
</p></li><li><p><b>classicalmusic</b><br>Jacob Collier isn't Classical and his orchestration and form are incredibly boring. His knowledge of <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is great however his execution lacks strength. I don't think it has lasting power as anything he wrote can be arranged 20 times better.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>I am not really a meme account. I just named my account this to make it so people will stop being like OH MY GOD STOP BEING AN ELITIST(of course no reason is given to why it is wrong). I just find the EDM/Rap/Pop/Rock/SmoothJazz industry annoying for a couple of reasons.

1) European Classical music used to be the only musical genre so there was never an idea of "the starving musician."

2) Your musical tastes are stuck at 14. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6GA9Px6qkc)

3) An industry which overexposes people to simplistic music made by people who just write everything by ear without a knowledge of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>. By writing by ear you are just imitating a song you hear in your head which is a combination of everything you listen to. This produces a musical echo chamber.

4) People are stuck only liking echo chamber music which is derivative of itself.

5) This industry works hard to ensure people think that classical music is just Vivaldi, Mozart, and Bach. This makes people think of Classical music as a Genre which has it's own sound which is derivative of itself.

6) People will constantly complain and make shitty anti-elitism arguments to defend their god-awful money squeeze sucking the soul out of the populace and turning music into a meer product, with the goal of making money.
</p></li><li><p><b>composer</b><br>If you are struggling coming up with melodies, and harmonies, study diatonic <b><u>harmony</u></b> extensively, until you have a good understanding of <b><u>harmony</u></b>. Then study form, particularily thematic form. You will have your music improve greatly from "just editing till I like it."
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>Functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is oppressive. Wow you really just made my day there. The irony of this statement. So you listen to Schoenberg all day? Free atonality and electronic music? What the fuck. You realize 90% of your music is just I-V-vi-IV so it is definitely inside oppressively simple functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>"if it makes you feel good," so good music means literally nothing. Claiming an objective descriptor to something you describe as subjective doesn't make any sense. Logically good music does exist. Good music is written by good musicians with a logical understanding of music. Bad music is written by bad musicians with no understanding of music. If you are just picking notes until something sounds good, you should realize you are choosing the slow method in which you will never get better at writing <b><u>harmony</u></b>. If you choose your notes based off of a logical structure you will become a good musician. Claiming functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> is oppressive and you should just choose notes then you will find you are writing music incredibly slowly....... You will not be happy with what you write, which is why you need things like money to make you forget how bad you are, brother.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>You didn't even read everything I said If you think that I am being elitist over musical taste. I am simply stating that amateur music produced professionally and amateur music produced soully for oneself are equal, but when you focus on professionalism, you are more likely to stay amateur. People have been proving it throughout this thread as somebody just literally said that Functional <b><u>Harmony</u></b> is oppressive and they should compose souly from "the heart"(changing the notes on ableton live until something sounds pretty).
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>This is somewhat of a linguistic thing and you should also realize that if you are talking about diatonic <b><u>harmony</u></b> instead of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> then you generally will state the key.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Are you already acquainted with four part <b><u>harmony</u></b> and common practice? Being able to write in that style will make writing in other styles easier. A good thing to start out is by comparing string quartets playing string quartets to sax quartets playing string quartets.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Jazz piano voicings seem a bit arbitrary to me and aren't given solid reason's like classical <b><u>harmony</u></b> is.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Early classical Haydn symphonies. Another good place is Daphnis et chloe by Ravel. If you just focus on one page for a while then that is a better place than anything for score-reading. I still recommend starting out with early music and gradually progressing through. Study Gradus ad parnassum. Study even earlier music. Study plainchant. Study renaissance music. If you have a solid understanding of that then studying Baroque will be much easier. What you should focus on in really early music is just the <b><u>harmony</u></b> and counterpoint. This remains true until you get to the classical period, where you should start focusing on balance and texture. As you work your way into the Romantic period. By the time you have a solid understanding of the fundementals, score-reading things like Daphnis et chloe will be much easier.
</p></li><li><p><b>ClassicalMemes</b><br>Claude Debussy invented Jazz <b><u>Harmony</u></b> and Beethoven invented Jazz Rhythm. Bottesinni invented bass solos. Adolph Sax invented the Saxaphone. Who invented drum solos?
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I wouldn't say Roman numerals would be meaningless, because they make visualizing chord progressions 20x easier. I would say that without a strong understanding of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b> you will just be wasting a lot of time doodling around when you could've written finished the song you were writing in two minutes if you understood functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>.
</p></li><li><p><b>WeAreTheMusicMakers</b><br>Finally! somebody here who knows the cosmic truth of functional <b><u>harmony</u></b>!

its only 4$ and for basic ear training its wonderful. just do a little bit each day. 

id recommend starting with interval training. also singing scales and intervals will help a lot too. 

for theory my school uses the Kosta/Payne Tonal <b><u>Harmony</u></b>. this text is okay for beginners and also teaches harmonic analysis fairly okay.  there is also a work book that is recommend. practicing is how you will come to develop how you think about theory and speed. 

if buying a college level textbook at full price is out of the picture id recommend doing some googling and watching some videos about basic theory and books that could help. youtube is a really good resource to learn basic and even advanced techniques. Allen Belkins series on modern <b><u>harmony</u></b> comes to mind.  

at the end of the day doing the basics and really driving them home slowly will be the most productive thing you can do. you can bend the rules without knowing them well.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>I would disagree that negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> is bad. maybe if you are trying to stick to western common practice era art music you could try and make a case for it. Saying something is or isnt something you can use in music makes no sense. What we use to understand music is all a system made up by us. Its the ordering of observations of how sound works. negative <b><u>harmony</u></b> is just one way to manipulate that system and when applied to harmonic progressions can be an interesting tool for you to use.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>so there is a few things you could do. Get more familiar with chord extensions, get better aquatinted with voice leading, figure out what they do in songs you like and repeat it. no one has a claim to <b><u>harmony</u></b>. I would suggest  getting more familiar with how chords function, voice leading, and chord extensions/ voices is where you will find the tools to do what you want to do. there are really good resources on this sub reddit and plenty of free texts about theory that will have something on chords and voice leading.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>it just depends on the composer. there are movie tropes used by some composers for things like super hero movies or horror movies and really any genre. So a blanket yes or no isn’t really possible but it would be safe to assume they use modern <b><u>harmony</u></b> techniques which include modal borrowing.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Common practice era. thats where our basis of <b><u>harmony</u></b> comes from. it has been developed since into more modern ideas through jazz and the romantic era. but its basically when people wrote with just a dom to tonic relation ship in one key for a piece. like the classical and baroque eras.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>you can “start a chorus” however you want. there isn’t really a rule. I would say to pay attention to the <b><u>harmony</u></b> you are using in that section and maybe take voice leading in account. otherwise just see what sound you like best. The only thing that might dictate a bit of what you use would be the tone of the song or the genre. Even then you still shouldn’t look at any kind of rule or genre norm as something you have to follow. you can always break the rules a little to make something sound like you want. 
hope this helps.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>i would recommend getting some text books 


(place holder) im currntly away from home but will get you the info for the jazz textbook im reading right now

when it comes to II-V-I progressions just finding tunes that are based off of them and transcribing the head and solos is a great way to learn about those kinda of progressions.  

there is a great modern <b><u>harmony</u></b> book written by persichetti or you could get the book by shenker on <b><u>harmony</u></b>

also check the sidebar there are lots of resources for learning.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>you have to ask yourself what you want to know and when. if you are craving to know how it all works then start theory today. learn the basics then you can go into modern <b><u>harmony</u></b> or even jazz theory with scale <b><u>harmony</u></b>. The sidebar has great resources, id recommend tenuto for practice. There are countless wonderful books, so message me if you are curious about some that i’m reading that could help. 

Music is really what you make of it. Its another artistic medium, a very unique one at that. the world of theory is kind of clouded by people wanting to make pop music and beats and be the next big producer. There isn’t anything really wrong with that, I wont sit here and shame others for just being interested in someone/thing. i’m glad those people are searching out the knowledge and interested. The problem i do see is people not understanding the artistic side of music. In the past maybe 50-60 odd years pop music and song writing has become immensely popular. I think this has covered up the fact the music is about art and has so much more to it than just pop songs. Its Learn what you want, and have fun with it, thats why we are all here anyway. 

So, I don’t think there is a “when” that i could say that would be correct other than; if you want to know, start as soon as possible.
</p></li><li><p><b>musictheory</b><br>Learn chord functions! C-am-F-G is I-vi-IV-V in C major,( 1-6-4-5)

when you look at a scale each note is the root of its own chord. the chords are built with thirds. i know you said you are aware of the side bar, however this is basic theory and thats got great resources for this. 

If you wanna be able to break the rules you have to understand them. You wont have to go down the rabbit whole, just learn how scales work, how modes work, then basic chord functions. If you are looking for more of a jazz based sound then learn about scale <b><u>harmony</u></b>, or the idea that every chord has a parent scale. 

again, its basic theory and the side bar is where you should go for these sort of things. Spend sometime learning and it will all click into place.
